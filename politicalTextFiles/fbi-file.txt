The Federal Bureau of Investigations keeps files on almost
every person in the entire
country.  They must send you your file if you want them to.
There will not be any charge if the file is under fifty pages.
If it is over 50 pages, then there will be a copying charge of
ten cents per page.  Your file can be obtained by
simply mailing a letter to them.  However,
the letter must be worded properly or else they will not comply, or
may only send you part of it.  Here is the address which you may
use to contact the F.B.I.:

Director
Federal Bureau of Investigations
Washington D.C., 20535

Here is the letter:


                                        <YOUR NAME>
                                        <YOUR ADDRESS>
                                        <CITY, STATE, ZIP>
                                        <YOUR PHONE NUMBER>

Dear Sir:
     I am requesting a copy of any personal file which you may
have on myself (SSN <Your sovial security number>).  
In addition, I am requesting
copies of all files, dossiers, documents, or materials referring
to myself.  If you consider some material exempt from diclosure,
release the material to me with deletions indicated and specify
your legal support for having made those deletions.  Finally, I
require a response within ten working days, as provided by the
Freedom of Information Act.  I appreciate your time and your
compliance with my request and the law.

                                        Thank you,


                                        <YOUR NAME>

This letter must be notarized.  To notarize a letter go to some
bank, NOT the Post Office.  The bank will check your
identification a stamp your letter, then go to the PO and mail
this letter.  The C.I.A. also has files, but I believe they stopped
updating information in 81.  A similar request can be made of ANY
government agency.  Knock your self out!
