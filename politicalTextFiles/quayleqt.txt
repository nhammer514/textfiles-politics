Bobby Knight told me this: 'There is nothing that a good defense 
cannot beat a better offense.'  In other words a good offense wins.
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle comparing the 
                   offensive capabilities of the Warsaw Pact
                   with the defensive system of NATO

Why wouldn't an enhanced deterrent, a more stable peace, a better
prospect to denying the ones who enter conflict in the first place
to have a reduction of offensive systems and an introduction to
defensive capability.  I believe that is the route this country
will eventually go.
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle

Republicans understand the importance of bondage between a mother and child.
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle

Mars is essentially in the same orbit... somewhat the same distance from the

oxygen, that means we can breathe.
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle

live in this century." 
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle 
                   (The New Yorker, October 10, 1988, p.102)

We expect them [Salvadoran officials] to work toward the elimination
of human rights.
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle

El Salvador is a democracy so it's not surprising that there are many voices
to be heard here. Yet in my conversations with Salvadorans... I have heard a
single voice.
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle

I believe we are on an irreversible trend toward more freedom and
democracy - but that could change.
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle

and that one word is 'to be prepared'.

Target prices?  How that works?  I know quite a bit about farm policy.
I come from Indiana, which is a farm state.  Deficiency payments -

We got loan, uh, rates, we got target, uh, prices, uh, I have worked
very closely with my senior colleague, (Indiana Sen.) Richard Lugar,
making sure that the farmers of Indiana are taken care of.
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle on being asked to
                   define the term "target prices."
                   Quayle's press secretary then cut short the press 
                   conference, after two minutes and 30 seconds.

I'm not going to focus on what I have done in the past
what I stand for, what I articulate to the American people.
The American people will judge me on what I am saying and what I 
have done in the last 12 years in the Congress.
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle

I want to be Robin to Bush's Batman.

Certainly, I know what to do, and when I am Vice President -- and
I will be -- there will be contingency plans under different sets of
situations and I tell you what, I'm not going to go out and hold a news
conference about it. I'm going to put it in a safe and keep it there! Does
that answer your question?

Quayle Quotes - brought to you by  Michael Goldsman (goldsman@cc.gatech.edu)
============================================================================

	Don't forget about the importance of the family. It begins with
the family. We're not going to redefine the family. Everybody knows the
definition of the family. [Meaningful pause] A child. [Meaningful pause] A
mother. [Meaningful pause] A father. There are other arrangements of the
family, but that is a family and family values.
	I've been very blessed with wonderful parents and a wonderful
family, and I am proud of my family. Anybody turns to their family. I have
a very good family. I'm very fortunate to have a very good family. I
believe very strongly in the family. It's one of the things we have in
our platform, is to talk about it.
	I suppose three important things certainly come to my mind that we
want to say thank you. The first would be our family. Your family, my
family -- which is composed of an immediate family of a wife and three
children, a larger family with grandparents and aunts and uncles. We all
have our family, whichever that may be ... The very beginnings of
civilization, the very beginnings of this country, goes back to the family.
And time and time again, I'm often reminded, especially in this
Presidential campaign, of the importance of a family, and what a family
means to this country. And so when you pay thanks I suppose the first thing
that would come to mind would be to thank the Lord for the family.
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle

...Buzz Lukens took that fateful step...
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle confusing the sexual
                   assaulter/congressman with Astronaut Buzz Aldrin.

Okay, I won't open it until then
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle after having been 
                   presented with an empty box that was to contain 
                   a gift from a sailing team in South America. 
                   He was told that the gift was not ready yet, 
                   but that it would be presented to him when they 
                   arrived in the United States. 

During the White House Easter Egg Roll of 1991, Quayle signed autographs
using only his finger. He had prepared pre-signed cards which his aides
handed out while he made signing gestures. This allowed him
to move briskly and efficiently through the crowd, said his spokesman.

Dan Quayle, in April 1991, was concerned that his advisors
may be getting out of touch with "Real Americans." In order
to combat this, he suggested that they read People magazine.

People that are really very wierd can get into sensative positions
and have a tremendous impact on history.

                   the helicopter upon arrival at Alameda Naval Air
                   Station.
   

Let me tell you something. As we were walking around in the store, Marilyn
and I were just really impressed by all the novelties and the different types
of little things that you could get for Christmas. And all the people that
would help you, they were dressed up in things that said 'I believe in Santa
Claus.' And the only thing that I could think is that I believe in
George Bush.

It isn't pollution that's harming the environment.  It's the

and we're not going to continue where we're going to go, not withstanding 
the Soviet Union's demise and collapse - the former Soviet Union - we now
have independent republics which used to be called the Soviet Union.
Space is the next frontier to be explored. And we're going to explore.
Think of all the things we rely upon in space today: communications 
from... Japan, detection of potential ballistic missle attacks. Ballistic 
missles are still here. Other nations do have ballistic missles. How do
you think we were able to detect some of the Scud missles and things like 
that?  Space, reconnaissance, weather, communications - you name it. We
use space a lot today.
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle

Need any help? 
		-- Vice President Dan Quayle in October 91 addressing

The message of David Duke, is this, basically: Big government, anti-big

                   analysis of the LA riots. (Herb Caen, SF Chronicle)

It's immoral to parent irresponsibly... And it doesn't help 
matters any when prime time tv, like "Murphy Brown", a character 
who is supposed to represent a successful career woman of today, 
mocks the importance of the father by bearing a child alone, 
and calling it just another "lifestyle choice." Marriage is 
probably the best anti-poverty program there is...
Even though our cultural leaders in Hollywood, network TV, the

us in this room know that some things are good, and other things are wrong.

                -- Vice President Dan Quayle

I want to show you an optimistic sign that things are beginning 
to turn around.
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle trying to convince reporters 
                   that the economy was doing better because a 
                   Burger King had a "now hiring" sign in the window.
                   He was campaigning for reelection in Ontario, CA

You have a part-time job and that's better to no job at all
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle after the manager of the 
                   Burger King had said that the jobs offered were part-time 
                   minimum wage jobs, which didn't pay enough to live on, 
                   and that "It's hard to find people who want to actually 
                   show up for the job."
           
Wouldn't it be wonderful to have a cure for AIDS in the marketplace
before Magic Johnson gets AIDS?
                --  Vice President Dan Quayle, 11/13/91 (CNN)

We're in Florida.
                --  Vice President Dan Quayle explaining why he
                    had just purchased four peaches (and no citrus 
                    fruits -- for which Florida is famous) at a Publix 
                    supermarket in Oakland Park, Florida. Georgia (which 
                    IS famous for peaches) did not gain from the transaction, 
                    however; the peaches were from Chile. (The Sunstenial)
 
I deserve respect for the things I did not do.
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle

I feel that this [1981] is my first year, that next year is an
election year, that the third year is the mid point and that the
fourth year is the last chance I'll have to make a record since the
last two years, I'll be a candidate again.  Everything I do in those
last two years will be posturing for the election.  But right now I
don't have to do that.
                -- Senator Dan Quayle 

I don't have to experience tragedy to understand it.
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle during a photo-op
                   in LA, responding to criticisms that he didn't 
                   understand what it meant to live in the "inner 
                   city." (WRAL 6/23/92)

My position is that I understand from a medical situation, immediately
after a rape is reported, that a woman normally, in fact, can go to the 
hospital and have a D and C.  At that time...  that is before the forming 
of a life.  That is not anything to do with abortion
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle  explaining that Dilatation
                   and Curettage, a form of abortion which occurs 
                   after fertilization, is not really abortion.
                   (the Washington post, 11/03/88)

Add one little bit on the end...  Think of 'potato,' how's it spelled?  
You're right phonetically, but what else...?  There ya go...alright!
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle correcting a student's
                   correct spelling of the word "potatoe"  during
                   a spelling bee at an elementary school in Trenton.

I should have caught the mistake on that spelling bee card.  But 
as Mark Twain once said, "You should never trust a man who has only 
one way to spell a word."
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle, actually quoting from 
                   President Andrew Jackson.

                   alley. the Vice-President bowled 5 times, and knocked 
                   down 19 pins.  (6/25/92, San Jose Mercury News)
                   The American Bowling Congress projected his score for a 
                   full game to be 76.  The Detroit average for amateur 
                   players is 163 (USA Today, 7/6/92)

It would be a serious mistake to replace a seasoned statesman with a 
tempermental tycoon who has no respect for the constitution.
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle giving his opinion about
                   Ross Perot's presidential campaign (June 1992)

Dan Quayle had a trip planned to Beijing, but was worried because of
Xthe turmoil at that end. His security adviser however informed him that
Xit was pretty safe for D.Q. as, "They are only harassing intellectuals."

And the President put his hand on my shoulder and said: "Dan, 
I _knew_ Spiro Agnew.  He was a friend of mine.  And Dan...  
You're no Spiro Agnew!"
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle 

This president is going to lead us out of this recovery.
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle at a campaign stop in 
                   California and and then at CA State University, Fresno
                   (The Quayle Quarterly, Spring/Summer 1992)

We have to do more than just elect a new president if we truly want to   
change this country."                                     
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle

and talk to her and support her on whatever decision she made.
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle respondiing to Larry
                   King's question of how he would react if his 13-year-old
                   daughter chose to have an abortion. (CNN, July 22, 1992)
                   Marilyn Quayle later remarked that her daughter would 
                   "take the child to term."
