                              by Bone

	Looking at the articles in this Issue I'd say CRN! is actually looking
a bit on the classy side.  We have some really good articles for you this time.
I actually only wrote one article this time.  The rest were submitted by
CRN! members.  Some of whom have some serious talent.
	CRN! now has over 225 registered users and keeps growing daily!
Our distribution also seems to be growing.
	Hopefully CRN! will continue to grow to a real force in the computer
world.  I have no intention of becoming like C|Net or anything like that.  I
don't want to be a pansy to the corporate world (even though I work in it :( ). 
I just want CRN! to be recognized as a voice in the computer world.
	I'm actually out of words.  On with the articles.

                      A MATTER OF FAIRNESS:
       WHY SOFTWARE COPY PROTECTION IS UNFAIR TO INDIVIDUALS
			WITH DISABILITIES
                           By Belgarion

Before I begin I would like to apologize for the necessity of a pseudonym.
You see my job focuses on providing information regarding assistive
technology and, more specifically, how to adapt computers for people with
disabilities.  However, since a good portion of my job deals with working
with many many computer software and hardware companies I have a concern
that just ONE may look unfavorably upon my opinions.  This, in turn, could
lead to said company refusing to work with us, which in turn could cause
some individual to not be able to use a piece of software they would want
to.  In addition, there is also always the possibility of my superiors not
appreciating this either (they are perfectly fine with what I do, they just
share the same concern that I do).  Anyway, on to the focus of this article.

As previously mentioned I try to help individuals with disabilities adapt
computers, both hardware and software for their use.  I work with
individuals of all ages and functioning abilities.  The software we adapt is
also equally as varied.  I have helped to set up computers for children with
Cerebral Palsy and adults who are paralyzed from the neck down.  Today one
of the largest obstacles for independent computer usage continues to be
software copy protection.  What is designed to save (or make) the companies
a few extra dollars is actually eliminating a potential revenue source that
is pretty impressive.  How impressive?  Microsoft has an entire team devoted
to making Windows 95 easier to use by individuals with disabilities (there
are notes about it when you install the software, in the manual, and an icon
in the Control Panel - they obviously take it seriously).  According to
Microsoft's Computer Accessibility for Individuals with Disabilities, "it is
estimated that there are over 30 million people in the United States alone
that could be affected by computer design."  That's a lot of buying power
and if the big M$ took note it's surprising that so many other companies
remain ignorant.

Of all the software available three types of software cause the most problems:
	a) Document check - It is fairly difficulty for an individual using a
headmouse (an ultrasonic device that is worn on the head an allows for full
mouse control, the user moves their head to move the cursor and blows into a
straw to click the mouse button) to turn to page 33 and look at word 6 on
line 5 paragraph 3.  While add-on TSR software, such as virtual keyboards
that work in conjunction with a headmouse, allow for 'typing' by the
individual, they are still unable to access the documentation.  Thus, they
can no longer independently use the software.
	b) CD Check and key disk - Again, an individual who is unable to
functionally swap CD's or disks is condemned to use the one in the drive or
not use the program at all.  I know that some CD's are required to be
present due to the vast amount of information required, and that disk towers
are available.  I am specifically pointing to those programs that could
reasonably fit onto a hard drive but deliberately require the CD to be present.
	C) Dongle - Possibly the worst of them all the dongle, frequently 
employed by high-power CAD and other professional software, can actually 
prevent a professional from doing their job.  I recently gave a copy of 
the 3D Studios 4 patch to an individual who is quadriplegic.  The person 
was so happy that he actually had tears in his eyes.  He had wanted to 
use the software for over a year however his adaptive hardware used the 
parallel port and was not compatible with the dongle requires to run 
3D-Studios.  The patch helped to solve this problem.

It is important to recognize that I do not advocate for illegally pirating
software.  I am only trying to point out how certain practices can vastly
effect a group of individuals who should be , but rarely are, taken into
account by the software developers.  I wonder how some of the companies
would react if Christopher Reeve wrote them and told them he would love to
use their product but can't because of the document check...

So what do I do?  I keep a library of patches for available software.
Copyware has also been kind enough to regularly provide us with Neverlock to
demonstrate how programs can be modified to avoid things like document
checks and key disks.  I also provide location information of FTP or WWW
sites where cracks are available (I can't keep copies of cracks that are
modified portions of the actual code - it's illegal ;) ).  I also try to
keep a few other tricks up my sleeve...

Anyway, this was just one person's perspective.  While I am sure that there
are some who agree and some who disagree I think that (for the most part)
people feel that EVERYONE should be able to use software.  If you would like
more information on adapting computers take a look in Yahoo.  They have a
pretty good list of links and can get you pointed in the right direction.

I can also be reached at AN369067@ANON.PENET.FI.  If you have any a major
problem or emergency I am sure that Bone will be able to find me...

The following message taken from a cpsr newsletter

--snip--

The Marketry company of Bellvue, Washington is now selling email
addresses of Internet users obtained from Newsgroup postings. From
the company's press release:

   "These are email address of individuals who are actively using
   the Internet to obtain and transfer information.  They have
   demonstrated a substantial interest in specific area of information
   on the Internet.  They are regularly accessing information in their
   interest areas from newsgroups, Internet chats and websites. . . .

                   JESUS TAKES OVER THE INTERNET!
                    Letter provided by ANONYMOUS
                         Comments by Bone
	
	First let me state that this is the first time I am commenting 
on something in a way I think may piss some people off.  Let me state
that I believe noone has ANY right to push their beliefs on someone
else.  Let it also be know that I am agnostic (not atheist).  This
was brought on by 8 years of private catholic school (the type
where they did hit you...hard) and a better than average IQ.
	These comments reflect the way I am towards people who
try to regulate others lives.  I have nothing against God.  If he does
exist I picture him as a big warm guy who when you reach heaven 
will say "It's OK, you screwed up, everyone does" and give you a big 
warm hug.  Not a "throw the sinner is hell" type of god.
	Anyway, anything starting in *** is me (Bone).

                 5 REASONS WHY ONLINE SERVICES ARE DYING
                            by Marty Robinson

	There was a very interesting article in the Atlanta Journal-
Constitution today. It's a reprint from the Orange County Register and 
was written by Stephen Lynch.

	This isn't the whole article, just the top 5 reasons online 
services are on the way out. 

"1- They can't keep up with growth. AOL Spokeswoman Pam McGraw says the
service receives more than 4 million e-mail messages a day from outside
providers - but that volume forces delivery delays of about two hours.
Unlike the Web, which is scattered across a worldwide computer network,
commercial services route all their subscribers through the same
bottleneck and the users are charged for the delays.

2- Too many graphics. Even on a high-speed modem, one page on (the online
services) can take forever to load. MSN spokesman Bill Miller says that
his service has been criticized by some users for it's abundant photos -
"from the result of us pushing the envelope." Make that "the result of
trying to make more money." On the Web, if something is taking too long to
load, you hit "Stop" and go elsewhere. Commercial services, in an effort
to run up your bill, make you load and load and load.

3- They are losing their content providers. Almost everything you can find
on a commercial service can be found on the Web. And more content
providers are leaving the companies in favor of a broader audience.

4- They've become blockades, not gateways. Commercial services have
realized the Web is the way to go, and the Big Four all feature browsers
to surf the general Internet. But to access the Web through AOL is to go
to New York by the way of Alaska.

5- They know they are dying. AOL is starting a direct Internet service. So
is CompuServe. Microsoft tried to by 20 percent of Netscape. Apple
Computer is transforming the World into a direct Internet service."

Mr. Lynch goes on to give one reason why online services are still not extinct:

"One reason why commercial providers aren't dying: No one has invested in
a national service that you can load on your computer, double-click and
boom, Web access. Until that happens, easy-to-use commercial services may
still cling to Internet newbies, who are good for at least six months
before they realize they are being suckered."

                       AOL4FREE - CAN I GET CAUGHT?
                              by ANONYMOUS

	A better question would be 'would they want to prosecute me if I'm
caught?' The answer depends on how easy it is to catch and trace you. A
little more than a week ago, certain persons in the underground community
found a security hole which allowed them to sign on any AOL account
without needing a password. While browsing around some TOS accounts, they
found EMAIL concerning AOL4Free. The letter you've all been massmailed in
the hack rooms explains how AOL can detect usage of AOL4Free. However, I
have managed to get my hands on a fuller version of the letter within
which AOL Staff admits plans to take legal action against AOL4Free 
users.

Barry--

This is great!  I talked to Jane and what we need is a list of screen
names only (no member names or addresses--those need to be subpoenaed)of
the aol4free people.  We then should get verification from TOS and then
hand them over to the Secret Service, but those are things you don't 
have to worry about.  So you may start whenever you're ready!

May

P.S.  How's the patent application looking?  :)

These people are idable as stealing time.  I think we have enough? to go
forward with legal action.  We are ready whenever you are.

  Heh heh heh .. looks like we've got a reliable AOL4FREE detector.  If
you filter the log for "CMis" you'll come up with what seems to be a
reliable list of AOL4FREE users. The CMis message is being output by the
terminal handler when it gets a holding area update carried in by a
q_context that doesn't have the same UID as the stored q_context.  These
updates are all coming in from Library with the last token being set to
Dd. 
  Knowing that AOL4FREE sends in constant K1s and that K1 is marked
pre-login, I hypothesized that the thing must start sending in the swarms
of K1 tokens BEFORE the user is fully logged in --- and, sure enough, 
when you look at the billing history of these folks, they pretty much all =
look normal until June (when AOL4FREE came out) and then they started racking
up 1000s of minutes of free time and almost no paid time.
  With this bit of knowledge, we should be able to comb through the old
logs and come up with a fairly comprehensive hit list which could then =
be verified by TOS (although it looks like a positive lock!).   Others can
decide what to do with them, but I have visions of all AOL4FREE hackers
getting simultaneously whacked.  The prevention code still needs to go
into the TIH, but that'd sure send a shot over their bow!  :-)

/David

-----------------------------------------------------------

	Looks pretty bad, doesn't it, with the Secret Service and everything. 
But not to worry... with v4 of AOL4Free, you are much harder to detect!

	You see, what AOL4Free does is send the free token after every 
real token.  When you are signing on, you send the 'Dd' token with you 
screen name and password, and a free 'K1' token is sent afterward. However,
because you aren't really signed on yet, AOL sees the K1 token as a bug 
and records it in a log. All the Network Ops people had to do is search 
their logs for this bug and viola, they had their AOL4Free users.

	v4 is modified so that it doesn't send the free token after 'Dd'. Users 
of v4 are totally Stealth... they 'look' just like normal AOL users. The ONLY
way for AOL to identify them as AOL4Free users would be to record their
entire sessions... but with hundreds of thousands of mac users, how would
they pick out suspects? They could comb through billing records looking
for inordinate amounts of free time, but for privacy and technical reasons
this isn't feasible.

NOTE: If you're calling from the 800 number, logging in over TCP, or have
not disabled caller ID with *67 AOL CAN TRACE YOU WITH THE PRESS 
OF A BUTTON. PLEASE, if you're on a fake account or doing anything highly
illegal, sign onto AOL only through your local number. They'll need a
court order to find you there.

                        by Dr. Suess (Doc@CatnHat.net)

	Recently I commented on my concerns about being removed 
from my server at the request of America Online.  Most would say this would 
be inappropriate.  My concerns derive from America Online's attitude that
they have the right to exercise control over FORMER America Online 
members.

	This truly reminds me of a movie, The Godfather, which is about 
the Mafia and is an excellent movie despite Marlon Brando.  Once a member 
of the Mafia you can never leave except as a deceased member.

	America Online seems to function the same way.  Once a member 
you will always belong to them.  I am, like many, an ex-member of American 
Online.  I often refer to Steve Case as Cardinal Case.  Perhaps I have been in
grevious error at great personal risk.  Henceforth I will address him
with great respect as Don Case.  I value my ISP account and would not
like to lose it nor become a member of the Federal Witness Protection
Program as I have enough difficulty keeping my name straight.

	Please note the first word of the second sentence of the paragraph
immediately following the header.

Is this a matter of semantics or a matter of attitude?  One nice thing
about me is that you will always know where I stand on an issue.  I am
assertive, aggressive and tend to call it as it is rather than as I see
it.  Based on my prior experiences with America OnMafia documented in
earlier posts I suspect this is an attitude problem.

"quickly quash" ?  quash: crush; subdue

Kiralynne, a dubious lady of a thousand names and even more personalities.

hmmmm... thinking again... I wonder if the illegal activity was reported
to the appropriate authorities??

hmmmm... thinking again... if the activity was illegal why was the member
not terminated??

hmmmm...hee hee...  inappropriate = terminated   illegal = cancelled post

Hello??  Hello??  Anybody home??  Odd... the lights are on but...

                          LITTLE THING ON TECHNOLOGY
                                   by Layne

	Well, as you might know all of the good, high quality games out 
today like Under the Killing Moon, Magic Carpet 2, and the others are 
CD-ROM based games.  You might see this as a problem because you are 
being required to access the data as fast as possible AND even multiple 
disks are becoming frequent.  I am sure that most of you out there would 
like to have many games.  What I mean is that, sure you can install one 
large CD game on your hard drive completely, but only one.  Now what 
current technology is working on is faster CD-ROM drives as well as 
multiple drives on your home used PCs.  For instance, remember when 2x 
drives were first out, you thought WOW!  Well, know I am seeing PCs that 
come with 3 (yes 3!) 4x CD-ROM drives in your machine or try out the 6x 
SCSI CD-ROM, that baby can cook.  Well enough from that end.

	Have you noticed that just a year ago Pentium was just coming out 
and had all kinds of problems, and now you can own a little P-75 for just 
under $1,500.  These are probably the best kind of machine to own in the 
home, unless your super rich and would prefer an SGI or SUNSparcstation.
The internet is expanding so fast that you must be connected or you will 
be lost in less than a year.  I mean, sooner or later there will be 
multi-player interactive and fully graphical operating games.  I mean 
right now MUDs and MUSHs and IRCs seem really nice, but what about a 
couple of years from now when something like Johnny Mneumonic comes to 
life just about everyone will be fully immersed.  Life as we know it 
today will be gone and if you're not at least 10% cyber-literate then 
you'll never know what's happening because it'll probably all be computer 
updated.
