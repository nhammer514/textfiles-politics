          George Bush is my shepard, I shall not want.
          He leadeth me beside still factories.
          He restoreth my faith in the Democratic Party,
          Yea tho I walk through the valley of the breadline,
          I shall not go hungry.
          For Bush hath annointed my income with taxes,
          My expenses runneth over my income.
          Surely poverty and hard living will follow me all the
          days of my life.
          The Republicans & I will live in a rented house forever.
          But I am glad I'm an American,
          And I am surely glad that I am free.
          But I surely wish I were a dog,
          And George Bush was a tree.
