More on Clinton's nominee to the highest medical office in the land.
The Democrats did everything they could to get the vote on the floor
of the Senate before the August break.  Fortunately, those opposed to
her were able to stall it until after they come back from break.  She
is openly and actively anti-Catholic.  We are researching one more source
of data on her activities.  If we able to get the information, we will post
it here.

              EXCERPTS FROM DR. JOYCELYN ELDERS ADDRESS TO
            ARKANSAS COALITION FOR CHOICE, JANUARY 18, 1992
                  ARKANSAS STATE CAPITOL, LITTLE ROCK

Re:   Anti-Catholic bigotry

"...and there the Church was silent when we talked about ...
[unintelligible] ... the first 400 years black people had their freedom
aborted, and the Church said nothing.  The way of life for the Native
American was aborted; the Church was silent. We attempted to eradicate
a whole race of people through the Holocaust, and the Church was silent.
Women had no right to vote for years.  We ask why.  Why do these things
go on? ... [unintelligible] ... Any time when the right of choice is taken
away from all of us and put into the hands of a few, these are the kinds of
things that will happen, over and over again.  Look at who's fighting the
pro-choice movement; a celibate, male-dominated Church ... "

[COMMENT FROM THE UPLOADER]   Elders nothwithstanding, I am getting a
little sick of hearing about NATIVE-Americans, BLACK-Americans, HISPANIC-
Americans, THESE-Americans, THOSE-Americans, and OTHER-Americans.  I was
born in Oklahoma; therefore, I believe I am a native-American as well as
every other person in born in the U.S.  My grandparents on both sides were
immigrants from Czechoslavakia, but, I would feel a little silly calling myself
a Czecho-American.

                       DR. JOYCELYN ELDERS SPEAKS

"I don't know of any parent who wouldn't go out at midnight and try to
find contraceptives to start their children properly."   (1)

"We've taught them (teenagers) what to do in the front seat of a car,
but not what to do in the back seat of the car."     (2)

"An integral part of a comprehensive school-based health clinic today
is that we have sexuality education beginning in Kindergarten."    (3)
[UPLOADER COMMENT]    Not with MY kid, you're not.

"Abortion has had an important, and positive, public health benefit."   (4)

"Abortion was the single most important factor in the significant
decrease in neonatal mortality between 1964 and 1977."    (5)
[UPLOADER COMMENT]    Yup, that'll do it.

"We would like for the right to life and antichoice groups to really get
over their love affair with the fetus and start supporting the
children."    (6)

"Look who's fighting the pro-choice movement: a celibate, male-dominated
church."    (7)

"I would hope that we would provide them (prostitutes) Norplant so they
could still use sex if they must buy their drugs."    (8)
[NORPLANT IS THE UNDER-THE-SKIN CONTRACEPTIVE IMPLANT]

"If Medicaid does not pay for abortions, does not pay for family planning,
but pays for pre-natal care and delivery, that's saying: I'll pay for you
to have another good, healthy slave."   (9)
[THIS WOMAN IS NOT ONLY RADICAL, SHE IS DEMENTED]

"Poverty and ignorance and the Bible-Belt mentality are responsible for
the rise in teen pregnancy in Arkansas."    (10)
[NOT ONLY IS THAT A STUPID STATEMENT, IT IS PARTICULARLY OFFENSIVE TO
CHRISTIANS OF ANY DENOMINATION.  SHE IS SAYING WE ARE POOR OR IGNORANT
OR BOTH]

The following are some excerpts from a column by Pat Buchanan in the
WASHINGTON TIMES, July 21, 1993:

"She also charges Christian conservatives, predominantly Protestant, with
having 'slave-master mentalities' and 'conducting a love affair with the
fetus'.  These 'very religious non-Christians', says Dr. Elders, 'love little
babies so long as they are in someone else's uterus'."

"Dr. Elders' financial arrangements have also attracted notice.  Since
April, she has been paid $685 per day, in consulting fees and expenses,
by Donna Shalala's Department of Health and Human Services while still
being paid a salary by Arkansas as state health director and by the
University of Arkansas, where she is a tenured professor 'on loan' to the
state.  She resigned as Arkansas health director on July 19."

[UPLOADER COMMENT]  Folks, this nomination by Clinton, like others,
is an insult to all moral people of this great country.  But, then,
what could we expect from a man who is totally DEVOID of any morals.

I'm sure this nomination will be first on the agenda when the Senate
returns from break.  It's not too late to let your senator know what
you believe about the nomination.

The directory of the entire senate is posted here in another of our
files here, and the members of the senate labor committee are
listed in our original Elders file - ELDERS.TXT.
