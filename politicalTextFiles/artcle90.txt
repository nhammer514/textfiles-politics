Subject: Year 1990: computer users rights and the popular press
Date: Sun, 30 Dec 90 22:19:53 EST

The year 1990 in review.  Here is a list of some of the articles that have 
appeared in the "popular" press in the last year.  There were some 800+
articles on computer crime, "hackers" (in the negative sense), and viruses.
For comparison there were about equal number of articles on those topics
in each of the preceeding four years.  However in the preceeding four years
I couldn't find a single article in 1300+ periodicals that mentioned
protecting rights of people who use computers.  Note the slight difference
from the rights of people in a computerized society (lots of articles on
privacy, computer (mis)matching, and various computer snafu's).

Perhaps the EFF should have hired a advertising firm before a lawyer? :-)

Actually for only six months it is a pretty impressive showing.

True, I'm not working on the clock, and it is sunday night, so this isn't as
complete as professional research should be, but you get what you pay for...
