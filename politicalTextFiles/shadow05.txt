Israel under second missile attack - Eitan Vazani.
--------------------------------------------------
.
Another missile attack has ended just a few minutes ago.  It was my
father's turn to be the first to notice the alarm.  The attack started
around 7:15 in the morning.  We expected it.  We knew that the Iraqis
are going to try to surprise us (the previous attack was at 2:00 am).
Once again, Israel reacted quickly and efficiently.  With a minute or
two most people got inside their sealed rooms and wore the masks.
Two minutes since the alarm started, I heard 3-4 loud explosions.  This
means that the missiles landed in Tel Aviv or nearby.
A short time passed and the army spokesman announced that the north and
the south regions of Israel are safe (no gas), and there is no need to
stay in a sealed room.  In the central region (Tel Aviv area - where
missiles hit), people were instructed to stay in sealed rooms and keep
wearing gas masks.  It took 15 more minutes to declare that the attack
is over, meaning the missiles were explosives again, not gas.
There are no news about casualties yet, so I will add it later.
.
It is hard to believe that it happens to me.  Until now I only read
about bombing and gas attacks.  (You may be surprised to know that
Israel cities used to be very safe, even in war).  Sometimes I have
the feeling that I am in a movie, or that it is just a dream.
But don't worry, there is no way we will give up.
Writing all these articles also helps me.  It is some way to relieve
tensions, to keep me doing something useful.  A therapy maybe ...
.
It is afternoon, and the details of the morning missile attack are now
fully known.  16 people were injured very lightly, all of them except
one have been released from hospital.  Several of them were not
physically injured, but suffered a mental shock.
.
It will be dark again in 2-3 hours, and we will once again wait for a
missile attack.  During the day we feel pretty safe, but since the last
attack was in the early morning, it may change.  However, if Iraq tries
to launch missile in daylight, they will be much easier to track down
and be destroyed.
.
Please note that I am not trying to bring you the news faster than CNN.
CNN can report live, but the reporters are not personally and
emotionally involved.  For them, Israel is just another news sight,
and they can't get the real feeling of Israeli public.
They are doing wonderful job, though, all throughout the world, and we
watch many CNN reports which we consider to be of an excellent value.
I think the way CNN works is a perfect model of how a news network
should do its job.
.
Night has passed and it is morning again.  This night was quiet, and
there was only one short, false alarm, at 22:00.  I stayed the night
in my girlfriend's house.  She is very nervous these days, and tired
of the tension.  She considers flying to Germany to stay with her aunt.
During the night the army revealed that the  U.S.A sent Patriot missiles
to try to protect Israel.  These were designed as anti-aircraft
missiles, but due to outstanding performance they were converted to
intercept missiles too.  However, it was stated the the Patriot cannot
stop all missiles.  (By the way - parts of the Patriot guidance systems
are made in Israel).
Life in Israel are not yet back to their normal course.  Residents of
the south were instructed to go to work as usual, but stay tuned.
The rest of Israel people should go shopping and return home as soon as
possible.  I suspect that the quiet night is just another Iraqi attempt
to trick us.  I am sure that they will launch more missiles tonight, or
maybe they will wait some more.
At least, we got some sleep.
.
That's it for now. Bye,
Eitan Vazani,
Israel.
