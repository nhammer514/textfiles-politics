                       Censored Books

Responding to the Meese commission's official approval of pressure-group
censorship, Waldenbooks staged a promotion featuring 52 volumes that had been
"challenged, burned or banned somewhere in the United States in the last 15
years." The titles and the reasons for outrage against these books are so
astounding that we decided to publish the complete list.
