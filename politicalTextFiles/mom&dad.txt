The following anonymous poem says something about love and feelings.

Dear Mom and Dad,
  The War is done, my task is through.
  But Mom there is something great
  I must ask of you.
  I have a friend - oh such a friend
  He has no home you see.
  And so Mom, I would really
  like to bring him home with me.

Dear Son,
  We don't mind if someone
  comes home with you.
  I'm sure he can stay with us,
  perhaps a week or two.

Dear Mom and Dad,
  There is something you must know,
  now please don't be alarmed.
  My friend in a battle recently,
  was hurt and lost an arm.

Dear Son,
  Don't be ashamed to bring
  him home with you.
  Perhaps he can stay and visit
  for a day or two.

Dear Mom and Dad,
  Before you give your answer, Mom,
  I really don't want to beg.
  But my friend fought in a battle
  in which he lost a leg.

Dear Son,
  It hurts to say
  my answer must be no.
  For Dad and I have no time
  for a boy who is crippled so.

So the months go by, a letter comes, it says
your son has died.  And when they read the cause
of death, the shock was suicide.
Days later when the casket comes,
draped in our country's flag,
they saw their son lying there
without an arm or leg.
