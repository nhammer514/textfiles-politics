THE 10 "CANNOTS" BY ABRAHAM LINCOLN

"You cannot build character and courage
        by taking away man's initiative and independence."

"You cannot help small men
        by tearing down big men."

"You cannot strengthen the weak
        by weakening the strong."

"You cannot lift the wage earner
        by pulling down the wage payer."

"You cannot help the poor man
        by destroying the rich."

"You cannot keep out of trouble
        by spending more than your income."

"You cannot further the brotherhood of man
        by initiating class hatred."

"You cannot establish security
        on borrowed money."

"You cannot bring about prosperity
        by discouraging thrift."

"You cannot help men permanently
        by doing for them
        what they could and should
        do for themselves."
