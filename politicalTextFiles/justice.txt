     In this Great and Glorious United States of America, the Land of the
Free, we have a different kind of justice...  I call it...

                                Fucked Justice

                 written by Dissident of The Esoteric Society

     Consider, if you will, the following scenes...
     I am a programmer.  I am also bored.  I seek new thrills, new challenges.
I want to do something noone else has done before.
     I create.  My creation?  A virus.
     Not just any virus, I write a mean virus.  I have given it the ability to
learn.  Not just learn from what I feed it, but to learn from what it sees me
do, to reason new situations out.
     It is but an experiment.  I was not serious about it, I have no desire to
release it upon the world.  But one night, I leave it activated, and forget
about it.
     I am angry.  A sysop has taken the freedom of speech from his
users, as the country is doing to its citizens.  I hack into the system.
I bring it down. My virus is watching.  It sees what I do.  It spreads
itself, and I do not even realize it.  The sysop comes back up, learning
his lesson.  My virus takes him down again.  And again.  It calls up all
systems that it can reach from that Sysop's phone, crashing all systems
that resemble his. It finds systems not like the one he saw me crash. It
does not have the morals I do, the reasons that I do.  It knows only
that it saw me hack and crash.  It must be the right thing to do. It
breaks into the unknown systems.  It spreads itself.  It crashes
systems.  Of course I see what it does.  But I admit creating the
monster to noone.  I didn't tell it to do what it is doing. It grows
more powerful, smarter, faster.  There is no system it cannot get in to.
And eventually, the inevitable happens...  It is traced back to me. My
house is stormed as if I were the anti-Christ come to take over the
world.  I am pushed, shoved, and kicked around.  My system is rudely
unplugged and boxed up, I am led to jail, I am locked up.  I know not
what my crime is. Eventually, I am told that the virus was traced back
to me.  I admit it, but I tell them I did not release it, I did not
write it to do what it was doing.  Do they believe that?  No. I am taken
before a judge.  The papers have blown everything out of proportion.  I
suddenly am the anti-Christ.  I suddenly am a Communist Agent, come to
take over America's computers...  Never mind the fact that the virus did
not attack selectively, it hit the whole world.  I am guilty before I
take the stand, I am guilty before being sworn in, my hand upon that
which tells us not to swear. Nothing I say or do convinces them that I
am not responsible.  I am convicted, I am sent to prison, I am fined,
and I am scarred for eternity. It was MY creation, therefore *I* must be
punished for its mistakes. Is that justice?  No.  It is fucked justice.
Parents create a new human being in their lust-making. They bring an
unknowing child into a harsh, uncaring world.  They treat it like a
baby, no matter what its age.  They drink, do drugs, commit adultery,
molest the child, beat the child and each other, they steal, they lie,
they cheat.  They promote war, and violence.  They tell the kid that it
knows nothing because it is younger than they.  They stunt its growth,
they clip its wings so that it cannot fly.  But when their little bird
reaches 18, they kick it out of the nest.  They have never taught it
responsibility..ethics..with no strength to fly, it crashes down into
the real world below. The child knows no other reality.  How can it know
right from wrong when it has never been told or shown the difference?
It has only its parents' actions to go by...And the "Do as I say, Not as
I do"?  Ha, we learn by example.  The 'adult' knows no responsibility,
for it has never been given any before.  It doesn't know how to handle
freedom, or even the lack of freedom that the responsibilities load onto
its back. It does the same things its parents did...  Only this time, it
progresses beyond simple beatings...  It kills.  And it is caught. Whose
fault is it that the child grew up to be a murderer?  The child's. It
should have known better.  HOW?  HOW can it know what to do and what NOT
to do if it is never allowed to make mistakes?  EVERYTHING was done for
it, it was told what to THINK, what to SAY, how to ACT.  WHAT is it
supposed to do when it gets on its own?  Is it the child's fault?  IS
IT?

     I can be convicted for creating a monster.  Why is that my fault,
but if I was the child above, it would not be my parents' fault for
creating me?  "Oh that is different!  A Child should know better!"
HOW?!?!?

     In this society, being 18 automatically means you know what to do and
what not to do.  You suddenly have ethics and morals.  You suddenly are
responsible for your own actions.  All these things, probably, for the first
time in your life.

     But are your parents held accountable?  Not by the JUSTICE system of this
glorious country.  If you write something that can devestate a world run by
computers, is the PROGRAM responsible for what it does?  No.

     I, the parent of the world's worst virus, am accountable for its actions.
But you won't see MY parents on death row for me killing someone, now will you?

     Justice?  Fucked Justice,whether you ask me or not.
