Israel attempts to get back to normal life - Eitan Vazani.
----------------------------------------------------------
.
Another quiet night was followed by a quiet day.
It is now late at night again, and who knows how this one will be.
To sum up last several nights:
- The war started, everybody got up because of the excitement and also
  to make final preparation for missile attack.
- Expected missile attack arrives at 2:00.
- Another missile attack, this time at 7:15 am.  We get used to it.
- A quiet night with lots of tension.
- Another quiet night.
- This night "happens" right now.
.
We heard about the outstanding performance of the American Patriot
missile in the Saudi Arabia.  We hope it to be just as successful
in case of an attack on Israel.  (U.S.A sent Patriot missiles with
American crews to protect Israel, until Israel crews take over).
.
Today, people started to go to work as usual.  Of course, only those
who live in places that are less likely to be attacked.  Many people
couldn't sit at home all day, and they were eager to get out.  Some of
them did go out to work, to shop or just spend some time outside.
I heard that one missile exploded in the vicinity of my work place.
It could be that my office was hit, I just don't know yet.
Surprisingly, the government and the army announced that tomorrow
everything will be back to normal, except schools and universities.
So I'll go to work in the morning, and find out if my office still
exists.  Anyway, I will also go to see the explosion sight and describe
it to you soon.
I don't know whether to go to sleep and worry for not being ready in
case of an attack, or to stay up and be sleepy during the day (remember
that I have to go to work!).
.
Now, the matter of American POW seems to be serious.  I guess all of
you are familiar with the details, but I will repeat some of it:
The Iraqies seem to hold American, British, Saudi and Kuwaiti pilots.
The number of them is still unknown.  Some of them were shown on TV
in Iraq.  They were obviously forced to talk against the war and
"praised" the peaceful Iraq.  There are rumors that they were displayed
in the streets of Baghdad in order to cheer up the Iraqi people.
Iraq announced that the pilots will be held in several installations
to prevent bombing these installations.
Well, the facts speak for themselves.  I have nothing more to add,
except that this barbaric behavior is not particular to Iraq or to
Saddam Houssain.  It is characteristic to most Arab people.  The reason
to this is simple:  A fanatic, ruthless religion, which is deeply set
in the minds of the Arabs for 1300 years.
And Israel faces 400 millions of these Arabs.  Think about it.
.
Well, it seems that there is nothing more to report, except that
Israel is trying to live its normal life.  It is too soon to try to
draw any conclusions about the behavior of Israeli people, since
another attack may start another period of stress, which will change
the picture.
.
Goodbye for now.
I will be glad to answer any questions regarding the situation in
Israel now.  (Please save more general topics to a time when it all
calms down here).
Eitan Vazani.
Israel.
