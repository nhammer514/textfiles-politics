On Bargains:
"Sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing."

On Class:
"The distinctions separating the social classes are false; in the
 last analysis they rest on force."

On Conformity:
"It gives me great pleasure indeed to see the stubbornness of an
 incorrigible nonconformist warmly acclaimed."

On Curiosity:
"The important thing is not to stop questioning.  Curiosity has its
 own reason for existing.  One cannot help but be in awe when he
 contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous
 structure of reality.  It is enough if one merely to comprehend a
little of this mystery every day.  Never lose a holy curiosity."

On Future:
"I never think of the future.  It comes soon enough."

On God:
"God is clever, but not dishonest."

On Humanity:
"We cannot despair of humanity, since we ourselves are human beings."

On Hunger:
"An empty stomach is not a good political advisor."

On International Relations:
"In relations among seperate states complete anarchy still prevails.  I do
 not believe that we have made any genuine advance in this area during the
 last thousand years."

On Life:
"We are like shipwrecked people trying to keep their balance on a miserable
 plank in the open sea...but once we fully accept this, life becomes
 easier."

"What I value in life is quality rather than quantity, just as in Nature the
 overall principles represent a higher reality than does one single object."

On Luxury:
"Possessions, outward success, publicity, luxury--to me these have always
 been contemptible.  I believe that a simple and unassuming manner of life
 is best for every one, best for both the body and the mind."

On Military Secrecy:
"Every citizen must make up his mind...if he accepts the premise of war he
 must endure the consequences of military secrecy."

On Mystery:
"The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious.  It is the
 fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true
 science."

On Nationalism:
"Nationalism is an infantile disease.  It is the measles of mankind."

On Nuclear Energy:
"Since I do not forsee that atomic energy is to be a great boon for a long
 time, I have to say that for the present it is a menace.  Perhaps it is
 well that it should be.  It may intimidate the human race into bringing
 order into its international affairs, which, without the pressure of fear,
 it would not do."

On Opposition:
"Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre
 minds."

On Patriotism:
"The heroism at command, this senseless violence, this accursed bombast of
 patriotism--how intensely I despise them!"

On Power:
"What should be done to give the power into the hands of capable and well-
 meaning persons has so far resisted all efforts."

On Reason:
"Reason, of course, is weak, when measured against its never-ending task."

On Religion:
"Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind."

"What humanity owes to personalities like Buddha, Moses and Jesus ranks for
 me higher than all the achievements of the enquiring and constructive
 mind."

On Simplicity:
"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."

On Solitude:
"I live in that solitude which is painful in youth, but delicious in the
 years of maturity."

On Success:
"Try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of
 value."

On Testification:
"Every intellectual who is called before one of the committees ought to
 refuse to testify, i.e. he must be prepared...for the sacrifice of his
 personal welfare in the interest of the cultural welfare of his country....
 This kind of inquisition violates the spirit of the Constitution.
 If enough people are ready to take this grave step they will be successful.
 If not, then the intellectuals of this country deserve nothing better than
 the slavery which is intended for them."

On The Theory Of Relativity:
"I sometimes ask myself how it came about that I was the one to develop the
 theory of relativity.  The reason, I think, is that a normal adult never
 stops to think about problems of space and time.  These are things which he
 has thought of as a child.  But my intellectual development was retarded,
 as a result of which I began to wonder about space and time only when I had
 already grown up."

On Tolerance:
"The most important kind of tolerance is tolerance of the individual by
 society and the state." 

On Truth:
"If you are out to describe the truth, leave elegance to the tailor."

"Truth resembles a statue of marble which stands in the desert and is
 continuously threatened with burial by the shifting sand."

On Tyranny:
"We may hope that even the dullest creature can be made to realize that, in
 the long run, lies and tyranny cannot triumph."

On Value:
"All that is valuable in human society depends on the opportunity for
 development accorded the individual."

On Violence:
"Degeneracy follows every automatic sysem of violence, for violence
 inevitably attracts moral inferiors.  Time has proven that illustrious
 are succeeded by scoundrels."

On War:
"As long as there are sovereign nations possessing great power, war is
 inevitable."

"I do not believe that civilization will be wiped out in a war fought with
 the atomic bomb.  Perhaps two thirds of the people on earth might be
 killed, but enough men capable of thinking, and enough books, would be left
 to start again, and civilization would be restored."

"The next World War will be fought with stones."

On Wonder:
"He who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as
 dead; his eyes are closed."
