 "..There is no longer any room for hope.  If we wish to be free;
if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges 
for which we have been so long contending; if we mean not basely 
to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long 
engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon, 
until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained; 
WE MUST FIGHT!  I repeat it, sir, we must fight!!  An appeal to 
arms and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!

They tell us, sir... that we are weak, unable to cope with 
so formidable an adversary.  But when shall we be stronger.  
Will it be the next week or the next year?  Will it be when we 
are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be 
stationed in every house?  Shall we gather strength by 
irresolution and inaction?  Shall we acquire the means of 
effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging
the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound
us hand and foot?  Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use
of those means which the God of nature has placed in our power.
Three millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty and
in such a country as that which we possess are invincible by any
force which our enemy can send against us.


Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.  There is a
just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will
raise up friends to fight our battles for us.  The battle, sir,
is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active,
the brave.  besides, sir, we have no election.  If we were base
enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the
contest.  There is no retreat but in submission and slavery!  Our
chains are forged.  Their clanking may be heard on the plains of
Boston!  The war is inevitable - and let it come!!  I repeat it
sir, let it come!!

It is vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen may cry,
peace, peace; but there is no peace.  The war is actually begun!
The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears
the clash of resounding arms!  Our brethren are already in the
field!  Why stand we here idle?
What is it that gentlemen wish?  What would they have?  Is life
so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of
chains and slavery?

Forbid it, Almighty God - I know not what course others may
take; but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!"

Patrick Henry then took his seat.  No murmur of applause was
heard on March 23, 1775 when he gave this speech at a convention
in Richmond assemble after Lord Dunmore suspended the Virginia
Assembly.  The effect was too deep.  After the trance of a
moment, several members started from their seats.  The cry, "To
arms!" seemed to quiver on every lip and gleam from every eye.

... "Liberty is NEVER unalienable; it must be redeemed regularly
... with the blood of patriots or it ALWAYS vanishes.  Of all the
... so-called natural human rights the have ever been invented, 
... liberty is the least to be cheap and is NEVER free of cost."
