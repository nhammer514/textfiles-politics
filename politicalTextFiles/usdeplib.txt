Upon request of the Superintendent of Documents, components of

increase or decrease the number of copies of publications furnished for 
distribution to designated depository libraries and State libraries so 
that the number of copies delivered to the Superintendent of Documents

delivered may not be restricted by any statutory limitation in force on 
August 9, 1962.  Copies of publications furnished the Superintendent of 
Documents for distribution to designated depository libraries shall 
include--the journals of the Senate and House of Representatives; all 
publications, not confidential in character, printed upon the requisition 
of a congressional committee; Senate and House public bills and 
resolutions; and reports on private bills, concurrent or simple 
resolutions; but not so-called cooperative publications which must 
necessarily be sold in order to be self-sustaining.

The Superintendent of Documents shall currently inform the 
components of the Government ordering printing of publications as to 
the number of copies of their publications required for distribution to 
depository libraries.  The cost of printing and binding those 
publications distributed to depository libraries obtained elsewhere 
than from the Government Printing Office, shall be borne by components 
of the Government responsible for their issuance; those requisitioned 
from the Government Printing Office shall be charged to 
appropriations provided the Superintendent of Documents for that 
purpose.
