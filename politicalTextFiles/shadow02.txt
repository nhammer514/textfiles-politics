Israel at the start of the Iraqi war - Eitan Vazani.
----------------------------------------------------
.
Hello again to all Shadow BBS callers.
.
I am writing this a mere 90 minutes since U.S. forces started attacking
Saddam Houssain's forces.  The past 3 days in Israel were loaded with
high tension, which is now at its peak.  When the attacks began 90 mins.
ago, it was 2:00 am.  Many people in Israel were not sleeping and sat
listening to the radio, waiting for the news.  And the news arrived.
Israeli government instructed everybody to stay at home, and prepare
the gas protection means (gas mask, Atropin shot, cleaning powder, etc.).
Quickly, all those who were staying up called their friends to make sure
they wake up and get ready.  Within an hour most of Israel began preparing
to a possible a gas attack (Conventional explosive attacks are less
worry, since many people here are familiar with it).
I for example, were sleeping at my girlfriend's house.  Like the rest of
the people here, I suspected that "tonight is the night", but nevertheless
fell asleep.  My girlfriend's grandmother was to nervous to stay up, and
she sat listening to the radio.  When she heard that it's started, she
awakened the rest of us.  After calming down my girlfriend, I explained
to her how to use the gas mask, and rushed home to wake up my parents
and my sister (who just came for a free evening from the army...).
I woke up everybody, and briefed them with everything I already knew.
We prepared the house by closing all the windows, and prepare our gas
masks.  Within minutes we started calling friends and neighbors to make
sure they are awake and aware of the situation.
Although CNN reports that U.S. Air Force attacked missiles and planes
dangerous to Israel, we are all very tense.  The Iraqis have about 30
small, movable missile launchers, and there are good chances that some
of them were not destroyed.  Also, they might send some bombers to a
one way mission against Israel.
We are tense and I admit that we are a bit afraid, but we keep cool in
order to behave properly if anything happens.
I must say that nearly all the people in Israel are actually glad to have
this war, since avoiding it simply means that Saddam Houssain will gain
more power (including nuclear weapons), which he will use against Israel
without mercy.  For now, Israel was not attacked, and therefore did not
attack Iraq.  But this may change every minute.
This is all for now, there are several things that I should do.
I will write more when I have something you.  I guess you are the first
to get first hand information from Israel.
From what I know until now, U.S. forces are doing just great.  I must
thank you, the people of America, for stopping this mad terrorist.
Israel knows too well the pain of losing sons and husbands in a war,
so we are all hoping and praying for American soldiers to get back home
soon and safe.
.
Goodbye,
.
Eitan Vazani.
