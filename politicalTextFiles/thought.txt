          If the World were a few feet in diameter, floating a few feet
          above a field somewhere, people would come from everywhere to
          marvel at it.

          People would walk around it, marvelling at it's big pools of
          water, it's little pools of water and the way the water flowed
          between the pools.

          People would marvel at the bumps on it and the holes in it, and
          they would marvel at the very thin layer of gas surrounding it
          and the water suspended in the gas.

          The people would marvel at all the creatures walking around on
          the surface of the ball and at the creatures in the water.

          The people would declare it sacred because it was the only one,
          and they would protect it so that it would not be hurt.  The ball
          would be the greatest wonder known, and the people would come to
          pray to it, to be healed, to gain knowledge, to know the beauty
          and to wonder how it could be.

          People would love it and defend it with their lives, their own
          roundness, could be nothing without it.

          If the earth were a few feet in diameter.
