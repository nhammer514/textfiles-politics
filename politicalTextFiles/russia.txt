 
                     THE COMING RUSSIAN INVASION OF ISRAEL
 
                               April 14, 1978
                             An open letter to...
 
     Mr. Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary
     Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
     The Kremlin
     Moscow, U.S.S.R.
 
     Sir:
          Your days are numbered!  Time is running out for Russia.  This is
     clearly set forth in Bible prophecy, which we will shortly point out
     to you.  Russia has very cleverly, so you believed, armed herself to
     the teeth, while by treaties and overtures for co-existence she has
     disarmed the rest of the world.  But your plans are not hidden from
     God nor from those who have read His prophecies.
          It is very clear that you plan to blackmail the free nations of
     the world by means of your overwhelming military might, into total
     nonintervention while you attack Israel on the pretext of settling the
     Middle East situation.  You will very likely have the enthusiastic
     support of most of the Arab nations as you make this attack on Israel.
     But what they will fail to realize is that Soviet Russia will remain
     true to her double-crossing tactics of the past, and once you are
     established in conquered territory in Israel you plan to then absorb
     the rest of the Middle East.  And this would not be difficult once you
     are there with your armed might.
          But God has some violent suprises awaiting you in Israel.  In
     1968, shortly following the 1967 six-day war in Israel, we wrote an
     open letter to Mr. Aleksei N. Kosygin, who was then Premier of Soviet
     Russia.  We feel it would be well to call your attention to the
     contents of that letter, because the warnings to Mr. Kosygin ten years
     ago are just that much nearer fulfillment today.  You at that time
     were arming Egypt for another attack on Israel.  We warned you that
     according to Bible prophecy the Arabs would never overcome Israel -
     that God would again fight for them.  That statement proved all too
     true when through your misguidance you directed Egypt in her first
     attack on Israel in 1973.
          By now all the world knows that Egypt is thoroughly fed up with
     your trickery and deceit.  So you plan to soon take the matter in hand
     and deal with Israel yourself, and once and for all eliminate Israel
     from the map.  But before you do so it might be well for you to read a
     copy of the open letter which we sent to Mr. Kosygin in 1968, warning
     him of the consequences of such action.  Here is the letter we sent to
     Mr. Kosygin:
 
                          An open letter to ...
 
     Mr. Aleksei N. Kosygin, Premier
     Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
     The Kremlin
     Moscow, U.S.S.R.
 
     Sir:
          This is a warning!  You and the rest of the Communist world, who
     have defied the God who created you, and have persecuted and murdered
     millions of Christians and plotted Israel's destruction, beware.  The
     God of the universe is nearly finished with taking your abuse.  You
     and your comrades are destined soon to lead your nation into total
     disaster as reward for the evil you have perpetrated.
          Your doom was foretold some 2,570 years ago, as God, whom you
     deny and hate, spoke through His prophet Ezekiel.  If you can track
 
 
 
 
 
 
     down a Bible somewhere in Russia, you will find the account of your
     impending judgment in chapters 38 and 39 of Ezekiel, in the latter
     part of the Old Testament.  Just prior to this section, in chapters 36
     and 37, the regathering of Israel as a nation is foretold and
     described.  The next two chapters, 38 and 39, proceed to tell how God
     is going to allow you to enter the land of Israel, not for glory, not
     for plunder, but for judgment.
          God is the Judge and the Sovereign Ruler of His entire universe.
     You have blasphemed and slandered your Sovereign.  You have plundered,
     castigated, and murdered millions of His subjects from the Baltics to
     the China Sea.  And you have meted out special persecution to those
     who love and serve His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ.  For His
     chosen people, Israel, you are planning annihilation.
          God is righteous.  He would be unrighteous to ignore your crimes
     and plans of total world takeover.  To you and all who have rebelled
     against Him, God has said, "Be sure, your sin will find you out."  In
     another place He said, "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also
     reap."  And you are about to reap your judgment - in Israel.
          God says He will be waiting for you in Israel in the latter
     years.  And who can deny that these are the latter years of this age?
     You plan for the coming age of Communist Utopia, world-wide, with God
     banished from the earth.  But God promises the Millennium, with His
     Son, Jesus Christ ruling as KING OF KINGS and LORD OF LORDS.  Who do
     you suppose is right?
          Concerning you, or your successor, God said to the prophet
     Ezekiel, "Son of man, set thy face against Gog, of the land of Magog,
     the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, and
     say, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the
     chief prince of Meshech and Tubal: And I will turn thee back, and put
     hooks into thy jaws." (Note: Gog is the political leader or chief
     commissar of Russia; Maygog is Russia, the nation).
          Magog, Meshech, and Tubal, spoken of here, were three sons of
     Japheth, who was one of the sons of Noah, who survived the great
     Flood.  These three sons of Japheth are said to be the progenitors of
     the races inhabiting Eastern Turkey, Russia and much of Siberia.
          Notice that God speaks of your impending judgment here even
     before He tells where it will happen.  Then He goes on to state that
     He will bring you, with your "army, horses and horsemen," down into
     the land of Israel.  Your unholy purpose is also described.  Your
     predator nation is out to take prey, and take prey in Israel, and in
     Jerusalem, home of Christendom and Judaism.
          You were dealt a small suprise in Israel in June of 1967.  You
     and your Politburo are the ones who have promoted the vengeance, the
     hatred, and the arming of the Arab nations against Israel.  You are as
     interested in destroying Israel as you are in destroying Christendom.
     You were undoubtedly greatly suprised to see the tiny nation of Israel
     crush the imposing but not-so-great Arab confederation of nations.  Be
     assured of this: it was something more that the economic power and the
     military prowess of the Israelis which put the Arabs to flight. It is
     God who both prospers world empires and calls them into judgment.
          We understand that you are rearming Egypt and Syria, along with
     other Arab nations, for further battle with Israel.  You have
     declared, with your peace-gilded hypocrisy, that you will put
     everything you have behind the Arabs against Israel.  According to the
     prophecy in Ezekiel, we declare that the Arabs will never overcome
     Israel.  God will again fight for them.
          Your prophet, Lenin, forecast that Russia would defeat the
     British Empire not on the banks of the Thames, but on the banks of the
     Yangtze, the Ganges, and the Nile.  The prophet Ezekiel, on the other
 
 
 
 
 
 
     hand, forecasts that the anti-god Russian Empire will meet  defeat not
     on the banks of the Volga but on the banks of the Jordan, the Suez,
     and Lake Galilee.  This is an irony, Mr. Kosygin, an irony among
     ironies.
          In fact, you are soon to realize that the situation is so serious
     that you will need to use the armies of Russia, and others, to win
     this war you are perpetrating in the Middle East.
          God says here through Ezekiel, that Persia, the present Iran,
     will be with you, besides "Gomer and all his bands; the house of
     Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands."
          Gomer, spoken of here, was another son of Japheth (you can review
     his genealogy in chapter ten of Genesis), and Togarmah was a son of
     Gomer.  Gomer is said to have settled the area that is now West
     Germany and Poland, and Togarmah later went south into what is now
     Western Turkey.  So it appears that East Germany, Poland, Turkey, and
     Iran will be going with you down into Israel "together with their
     bands" - which possibly will include other Central European countries
     you have enslaved.
          Just how soon this will happen we do not know, but it cannot be
     very far distant.  You have set your mind to take Israel, and no doubt
     you have other plans to seize the Arab nations.
          But take heed: here is another warning to you from God, which He
     spoke through the prophet Zechariah.  He said, "Behold, I will make
     Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when
     they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.
     And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all
     people: all that burden themselves with it shall be CUT IN PIECES,
     though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it"
     (Zechariah 12:2,3).
          God warns here that all who lay hands on Israel shall be "cut in
     pieces."  Egypt and the other Arab nations have already been cut in
     pieces by God's defense of Israel.  And if they renew the war, even
     with twice the armor and with much wiser and braver leadership, they
     will again be cut in pieces, most likely in a much greater way, just
     as surely as God is real.  And when you bring your great armies down
     from the North, they will be cut and quartered and fed to the wild
     beasts of the field (see Ezekiel 39:17-22).
          It is positively dangerous to touch God's chosen nation.  To
     Abraham, Israel's founder, God said, "I will bless them that bless
     thee, and curse him that curseth thee" (Genesis 12:3).  God has great
     plans for Israel, and He doesn't plan to allow you or anyone to stop
     Him.
          It's quite plain to see why you desire to seize the Arab nations,
     and destroy Israel.  After all, Israel is the great ancestral home of
     the world's great faiths.  Christianity and Judaism.  It would be
     quite a psychological victory.  Then also, the Dead Sea in Israel is
     estimated to contain $1,270,000,000,000 (one trillion, two hundred
     seventy billion dollars) worth of minerals.  The potash alone in the
     Dead Sea would fertilize the lands of the world for several centuries.
     This would give you a tremendous economic advantage over the rest of
     the world.
          And with the vast oil deposits of the Middle East under your
     control, you would have a strangle hold on the industry of Western
     Europe.  Then also, Israel is the land bridge from Europe and the
     Middle East into Africa.  This would give you easy access into that
     great Continent.  So the taking of Israel and the destruction of her
     peoples is quite important to you.  But know this for sure - God is
     watching your moves, and He knows your plans  He will be waiting for
     you in Israel.
          In this 38th chapter of Ezekiel, God tells you to "be prepared"
 
 
 
 
 
 
     and to make every possible preparation for this invasion.  Go ahead,
     make the most complete invasion plans ever made.  Remember, you will
     be fighting God Almighty, whom you say does not exist; but just in
     case you should find He does exist, you will want the greatest army
     and the finest equipment any army has ever amassed.  But then realize
     this: the larger your army and the more grandiose your plans and
     preparations in every way, the greater witness it will be to God's
     existence and to His power when you are destroyed by Him on the
     mountains of Israel.
          In this 38th chapter of Ezekiel, God says, "In the latter years
     thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and
     is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which
     have been always waste: but is is brought forth out of the nations,
     and they shall dwell safely all of them."  This is a good description
     of present day Israel, where the mountains have been reforested, and
     the swamps reclaimed.  They have been regathered from the nations into
     their anceient land, and they have reclaimed and reforested the land
     within your lifetime.
          Then God says, Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou
     shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands and
     many people with thee"  Ordinarily, we speak about going down south,
     but God says that when you go south you are going to ascend.  Could it
     be that this means you will come with a mighty air armada, dropping
     supplies, equipment, and paratroopers?  Coming "like a storm"
     certainly describes the deafening roar of a vast air armada.  And
     "covering the land like a cloud" aptly describes a vast air drop.
          Evidently, you are also going to send a good portion of your army
     on horseback.  That seems rather strange in this day of mechanized
     war.  But we have been informed that you have purchased horses from
     all over America and throughout South America and elsewhere.  Your
     explanation has been that you needed them on the farms.  Are you
     really using horses for plowing in this day of mechanized farming?
          Another strange thing is that God says here, through Ezekiel,
     that you will have weapons that can be burned.  Could it be that
     science will soon advance to the place where metal and mechanized army
     units will be obsolete because of powerful neutralizing rays that are
     being developed?

          You have asserted that there is no God.  You have published it,
     and you have seen to it that one billion or so impressionable students
     have been so informed or taught around the earth.  You have acted as
     if you believe there is no God before whom you will one day stand for
     judgment.  You have no use for the Bible or its teachings.
     Nevertheless, on the mountains of Israel, YOU are destined to teach
     the nations with great testimony both as to the existence of God and
     as to the soverignty of God over the affairs of men and their
     governments.  This will be the greatest lesson the world has had in
     many years - in fact, in several millennia, since the days of the
     Egyptian Pharaoh, to be exact.
          Ironically, even as Pharaoh of Egypt became a leading example of
     God's sovereignty in the Old Testament era, so you or your successor
     are destined to become the great example of God's sovereignty in the
     era of Christendom.  In fact, the nature of the cosmic judgments that
     befell Egypt may be remarkably parallel to the judgment that is your
     destiny.  To better understand the nature of your coming judgment, you
     may wish to read Exodus, chapters 7 through 14, which gives the
     account of the destruction of Egypt in that former day.
          God says through the prophet Ezekiel that the Israeli Army will
     not need to conquer you.  God is going to take care of that little
     matter.  And it is a very little matter when you consider the Almighty
     God, Creator of all.  Russia and all her cohorts are as nothing when
     compared to the great God of the universe, Who has created all things
     and Who holds all things in His hand.
          Also, be apprised of the fact that you will not be prevented in
     your evil intentions by the nations of the earth, the Western powers.
     They will not come to help Israel.  They may talk; they may vacillate;
     they may watch; they may even complain; but they will fail to act.
     They may disapprove, and ask what you are doing.  Here is what will
     happen among the commercial or Western powers: God says "Sheba and
     Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions
     thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou
     gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to
     take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?"  Many Bible
     scholars suggest that Tarshish represents the commercial or maritime
     powers of the world.
          No, you will have no trouble in approaching Israel, as far as
     other governments are concerned, or even from the Israeli Army.  But
     there, on the mountains of Israel, you will meet your God!
          God says here, "And I will bring thee against my land, that the
     heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before
     their eyes."
          Here's what will happen: God's anger is fiercely burning toward
     you, and He has prophesied thus: "In my jealousy, and in the fire of
     my wrath have I spoken, surely in that day there shall be a great
     shaking in the land of Israel; so that the fishes of the sea, and the
     fowls of the heaven and the beast of the field, and all creeping
     things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the
     face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall
     be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall
     fall to the ground.  And I will call for a sword against him
     throughout all my mountains saith the Lord God: every man's sword
     shall be against his brother.  And I will plead against him with
     pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his
     bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing
     rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.  Thus will I magnify
     myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many
     nations, and they shall know that I am the Lord."
          Unless you repent of your evil intentions and values, this will
 
 
 
 
 
 
     surely come to pass, and it may be very soon.  Your armies will be
     destroyed by earthquake, by flood, by great hailstones, by fire and
     brimstone!  You will perish upon the mountains of Israel as a witness
     to the Almighty God, whom you despise and deny.  Among those remaining
     alive, there will be such confusion that they will annihilate each
     other because "every man's sword shall be against his brother."
     Further on, God says, "I will turn thee back and leave but the sixth
     part of thee" (Ezek 39:2).
          Then in the 39th chapter, God says, somewhat ironically, that He
     will give your bodies to the birds and the beasts of the field.  He
     started out this prophecy with the figure of speech that He wwould
     "put hooks in your jaws."  It is in the market place where we see
     animals, often quartered, with hooks in their jaws, hanging where it
     is possible for the meat cutter to cut off portions for his customers.
     God will serve the portions of your flesh to the animals of the field.
     God says here, "Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of
     the field, assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every
     side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even to a great
     sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and
     drink blood....Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses...with
     mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord God."
          The irony is this - the predators of the field will feed upon the
     armies of the predator nation, and the vultures of the air will feast
     upon the armies of a vulture government.  And who will then complain
     of such poetic justice?  "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also
     reap."
          God further says here that all the men of Israel will be busy
     burying your bodies to clean up the land.  He says later on that they
     will hire men in continual employment in your burial.  This burial
     will take seven months.  That will be ample time for the birds of the
     air and the predators of the field to feast sumptuously.
          And here is a strange thing, but it shall happen.  God says,
     "Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord God; this is the
     day whereof I have spoken.  And they that dwell in the cities of
     Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons,
     both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the
     handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven
     years; so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut
     down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with
     fire."
          We have been given to understand that you in Russia are making
     weapons from a treated wood called Lignostone.  This wood, we
     understand, is chemically treated and stronger than steel, yet remains
     elastic.  The British are using a similar material for gears in their
     large vehicles.  We have also been told that it burns brilliantly,
     with intense heat.  So the Israelis may have remembrance of your
     invasion for seven years as they use your weapons, or the materials
     derived from them, for fuel.
          To you, your Politburo, and your atheistic cohorts, we challenge
     you to read about your destiny in these chapters in the Book of
     Ezekiel, if you dare.  In fact, reading the Bible in its entirety will
     reveal to you something about the mercy of God, as well as something
     about the justice of God.  There is also something about forgiveness
     of sins and Life everlasting.
          God further warns here in this 39th chapter, "And I will send a
     fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles."
          God says here that He will send fire and judgment upon the land
     of Russia while your armies are invading Israel.  So even at home, God
     will search you out.  The same fire shall also strike other parts of
     the world "among them that dwell carelessly in the isles" where men
 
 
 
 
 
 
     are given over to living for material things, for pleasure, for self,
     and have little or no regard for God, their Creator.  This could be
     part of the same fire from outer space that is prophesied to strike
     your armies in Israel.
          God is faithful to His promises of judgment as well as His
     promises of blessing.  Both are certain.  You can still make certain
     of God's blessing in your own individual life if you will repent and
     turn from your evil plans and turn to your God and Maker, and to
     Christ your Redeemer.  "Today, if ye will hear His voice, harden not
     your heart..." (Hebrews 3:7,8).
 
                                    Very sincerely,
                                    Ray W. Johnson
                                    Donald W. Patten
 
     Mr. Brezhnev -
 
          There is one thing which we failed to point out to Mr Kosygin,
     because at that time we did not think it was significant.  The matter
     to which we refer is that of Ethiopia.  The Prophed Ezekiel
     (Ezekiel 38:5) states that Lybia and Ethiopia will also join you in
     your infamous invasion of Israel.  The country of Sudan, north of
     Ethiopia, was part of Ethiopia in Bible times, so it won't be
     surprising if you will somehow include Sudan also among the invaders.
          At the time of writing to Mr. Kosygin the matter of Ethiopia
     seemed insignificant, first, because of her weakness, and second,
     because we couldn't see how or why Ethiopia would ever get involved in
     such a nefarious attack against Israel.  But with Russia's involvement
     so extensive now in Ethiopia, this matter becomes one of prime
     importance, and very understandable.  This teaches us again that we
     can't take any statement by God as being insignificant, or
     questionable.
          It might be of interest to you to notice that not one of the
     nations you have previously used in your invasions of Israel will be
     included in your most infamous invasion.  The reason for this is not
     presently known.  One reason could be that Israel may be forced to
     occupy these nations, if they continue to harass and threaten her very
     existence.  There are Bible prophecies which appear to indicate that
     this will be the case.  There will no doubt be other reasons as well.
     But the fact that the nations presently most hostile toward Israel
     will not have a part in your coming ill-fated invasion, is certainly a
     matter of real interest, even if at present we cannot be sure of the
     reason.
          Your invasion of Israel will very likely end communism in Russia.
     We say this for the following reasons:  Chapters 1 & 2 of the Prophet
     Joel also appear to refer to your invasion of Israel, as the invasion
     described by Joel has never yet occurred.  And in 2:20 Joel has this
     to say to Israel about the remains of your army after God is finished
     with you in Israel: "I will remove far off from you the northern army,
     and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face
     toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and
     his stink shall come up, and his ill savor shall come up, because he
     hath done great things."  This states that those of your army who
     escape annihilation in Israel, especially the generals and other top
     officers, besides political leaders, will be banished into Siberia.
     That's exactly the description of the land into which God says He will
     drive your "northern army."  Siberia, as you well know is a land
     "barren and desolate."  And Siberia faces the Pacific Ocean, no doubt
     spoken of here as the "east sea."  The Pacific Ocean is "east" of
     Israel.  And the "hinder part," or the backside of Siberia, is on the
 
 
 
 
 
 
     Artic Ocean.  This ocean could be termed the utmost sea."  There,
     your temperal judgment will be finalized.  But there is also a
     judgment to come, when all mankind will stand before God, there to
     receive His judgment as to eternal destiny.
          God is a God of mercy, and He will even there in Siberia grant
     you forgiveness if you honestly and humbly seek Him and repent of your
     ungodly attitudes and actions.  The time of the great judgment will be
     too late.  "Today is the day of salvation."
          Allow me to point out one more fact, Mr. Brezhnev.  You have
     endeavored to thoroughly downgrade God in Russia.  But through the
     fulfillment of this Bible prophecy God will be glorified by you and
     all others who have sought to eliminate Him from the scene in Russia.
     Here's what God says your attack against Him and His people in Israel
     will accomplish:
          "Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be
     known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the
     Lord" (Ezekiel 38:23).
          So even in this ill-fated invasion God will be glorified, and no
     doubt many will be caused to place their trust in Him and in the
     Savior, Jesus Christ.  We greatly rejoice to know that God will
     prevail and bring blessing and glory to His own.  And we trust that
     you also will one day desire to receive God's forgiveness, that you
     too might enter His glorious presence as a son of God.
 
                                   Very sincerely,
                                      Ray W. Johnson
