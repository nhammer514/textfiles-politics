

There was a white man, a black, and a Jew riding in a car when it was involved 
in an accident and everyone was killed.  The rescue folks were cleaning up the 
mess when suddenly the white man got up and brushed himself off.  One of the 
EMT's asked, "What happened?!"  The white man explained, "Well, when we met 
saint Peter, he says, 'Due to the lack of money up here right now, you can go 
back for $1000.', so I gave him the money and came back."  The EMT asked "Well, 
were's the other two?"  The white man again explained "Well, when I left, the 
black guy was looking for a co-signer and the Jew was trying to get saint Peter 
down to $750"....  



"Moosehead". A great beer...and a new experience for the moose!



One day, little Johnny was sitting on a corner, stirring a bucket of shit. 
The milkman walked up and said, "Whatcha got there, Johnny?"
To which Johnny replied (deep, slow voice is best) "Bucket o' shit."
"Whatcha making?"
"A Milkman."
"Hrummph!" said the Milkman and walked across the street. Next, the Mailman
came and said "Whatcha got there Johnny?"  "Bucket o' shit."
"Whatcha making?"  "A Mailman."  "Hrummph!" The Mailman walked across the
street and began talking to the Milkman.  Shortly after, a policeman walked
up and had a conversation with the two aggrieved men.  He then walked over
to Johnny and said, "What do you have there, Johnny?" "Bucket o' shit."  "I
bet you're making a Policeman." 
   "Nope, ain't got enough shit."



One day, Johnny was sitting in the library, calmly flicking small ball bearings

It was a month before Christmas, and just for a stunt
Santa had his face buried in Mrs. Clauses' cunt
There was a loud noise and Santa Jumped with a start
It seemed Mrs. Claus had cut loose with one hell of a fart
All Santa could do was gag and to spit
His face and his beard were all plastered with shit
Mrs. Claus was still on the bed, panting and groaning
Hollering for Santa to try and get his bone in
Santa started laughing and shouting, and with a loud cheer
Said I know what to do, I'll screw one of the deer
They're cleaner and neater, and don't you suppose
I'll be just the right height if I stand on my toes
Santa ran from the barn Shaking his head at the noise
Saying Jesus Christ, how'd I know they were all boys 
It was getting about time to head for the south
Santa hoping he could get rid of the taste in his mouth
As the reindeer proceeded to line up in fours
Santa hollered "Merry Christmas Mrs. Claus this vibrator is yours!"
As Santa and his sleigh streaked into the sky
He said you may not be able to fuck yourself, but why don't you try
While Santa rode in the night, his ass frozen to the sled
He started thinking of Mrs. Claus at home in her warm bed
Santa spun in midair and headed back to the pole
They say he never go t farther from that hairy old hole
The moral of this story will end with this bit
Any job that you do, you just have to take shit.



Little Johnny was twelve years old and like other boys of his age, rather 
curious.  He has bben hearing quite a bit about "courting" from older boys, and 
he wondered what it was and how it was done.  One day he took his questions to 
his mother, who became rather flustered.  Instead of explaining things to him, 
she told him to hide behind the curtain one night and watch his older sister 
and her boy friend.  This he did.  The following morning he described 
everything to his mother. 

  "Sis and her boy friend sat and talked for awhile, then he turned off most of 
the lights, and he started kissing and hugging her.  I figured sis must be 
getting sick because she started looking funny.  He must have thought so too 
because he put his hand under her blouse to feel her heart just like a doctor 
would, except hes not as smart as the doctor because he seemed to have trouble 
finding the heart.. 

I guess he was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started 
panting and getting all out of breath.  His other hand must have been cold, 
because he put it under her skirt.  Aboout this time, sis got worse, and began 
to moan and squirm around. They slid down to the end of the couch.  This was 
when the fever started.  I know it was a fever, because sis told him she felt 
really hot.. 

Finally, i found out what was making them so sick:  A big eel had gotten inside 
his pants somehow.. It just jumped out of his pants and stood there, about ten 
inches long. Honest. Anyway, he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting 
away. 

When sis saw it she got really scared, her eyes got big and her mouth fell 
open.  She started calling out to god and stuff like that.  She said it was the 
biggest one she had ever seen.  I should tell her about the ones down at the 
lake.. 

Anywa, sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting its head off. All of a 
sudden she made a noise and let the eel go... I guess it bit her back, then she 
grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a muzzle out of his 
pants pocket and slipped it over the eels head to keep it from biting again. 

Sis laid back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor lock on it, and he 
helped by laying on top of the eel.  The eel put up a hell of a fight.  Sis 
started graning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch.  I 
guess they wanted to kill the eel by squashing it between them.. 

After a while, they both got up and gave a great sigh, her boyfriend got up and 
sure enough, they had killed the eel.  i know it was dead, because it just hung 
ther, limp and some of its insides were hanging out.. 

Sis and her boyfreind were a little tired from the battle, but they went to 
courting anyway.   He started hugging and kissing again.  By Golly, the eel 
wasn't dead.  It jumped straight-up and started to fight again. i guess eels 
are like cats... they have nine lives... 

This time sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting on it.. After 
fifty-five minutes of struggle, they finally killed the eel.  I know it was 
this time because i saw sis's boyfriend peel its skin off and flush it down the 
toilet.. 

Johnny's mother fainted.

        Each is asked what they want to take.

      First the white guy is asked what he wants to take. He
        says, "I'd like to take a glass of water."

          "Why a glass of water?" he is asked.

              "So I can have something to drink when
               I get thirsty."

      Next the black guy is asked what he wants to take. He
        says, "I'd like to take an ice cube."

          "Why an ice cube?" he is asked.

               "So I can have something to suck on
                when it gets hot."

      Finally the Polock is asked what he wants to take. He
        says, "I'd like to take a car door."

          "Why a CAR DOOR?" he is asked.

               "So I can roll down the window when
                it gets hot!"

had an accident, and my dick was cut off, so the doctor replaced it with the

could do it again. He hesitatnly said `Yeah, I can do it again, but I don't

"Aren't you going to kiss the frog?" she asks.

"Are you kidding?" laughs the rescuer.  "You can make more money with a
talking frog than you can with a hotshot Wall Street stockbroker."





For as long as they could remember, four men had gotten together early
each December for a sauna and pre-Christmas lunch.

"I won't be able to make the sauna this year, but I'll meet you at the

events of the year.

"Excellent.  Couldn't be better.  He's in business for himself now,
making tailor made suits.  Things are going so well for him that only
yesterday, he gave one of his friends a free suit."

"A free suit?"

"Absolutely," says Dick.

"And how is your son, Tom?"

Tom beams.

"My son is selling cars.  He's very successful.  He's the top salesman
at his dealership.  He's doing so well that only last week he gave a
friend a car."

"Gave a friend a car?"

"Free.  For nothing."

Tom and Dick shake their heads, delighted at their kids' success.

"How about your son, Harry?" asks Tom.

"Don't ask," says Harry.  "My son is in real estate.  My son is selling
condos as if there were no tomorrow.  My son has sold so many condos
that only last week, he gave one of his friends a free condo."

"No!"

"Yes!  Gave away a condo!"

The three men agree they're blessed to have such successful, generous
sons.

They get dressed and head over to the deli to meet their fourth pal for
lunch.

Chuck is sitting at the table holding his head in his hands.

"Old friend!"  Tom, Dick and Harry cry, "Why so sad?"

Chuck sighs.

"It's about my son," he says.  "I don't know how to tell you this, guys.
 My son only told me last night at dinner.  He's gay."

"No!"

"Yes, and I don't mind admitting, I'm having some real difficulty coping
with this as a man.  Is it my fault?  Should I have done something
differently?"

"Don't torture yourself," advises Tom.

"Don't dwell on it," comforts Dick.

"Whatever will be, will be," adds Harry.

Chuck shakes his head.

"You're right.  It's his life.  I've got to accept it.  I should look on
the bright side.  He's making lots of new friends, I guess.  Why just
last week, these new friends gave him a new suit, a new car, and a new
condo."

7.  You put on the news and they're displaying emergency routes out of the
    city.
8.  The woman you've been seeing on the side begins to look like your wife.
9.  Your twin sister forgets your birthday.
10. You wake up to discover that your water bed broke and then you realize
    that you don't have a water bed.
11. Your horn goes off accidentally, and remains stuck, as you follow a
    group of Hell's Angels on the freeway.
12. The timer on your coffee maker is set to brew at 8:00 a.m. and you
    forgot to put the coffee pot in the dispenser.

How to get along at the office:

If it rings, put it on hold;
If it clanks, call a repairman;
If it whistles, ignore it;
If it's a friend, take a break;
If it talks, take notes;
If it's handwritten, type it;
If it's copied, file it;
If it's Friday, forget it!





How to succeed without talent:

1.  Study to look tremendously important.
2.  Speak with great assurance.  Stick to generally accepted facts.
3.  Avoid arguments; if challenged, fire an irrelevant question at your
    antagonist and intently polish your glasses while he tries to answer.
    As an alternative, hum under your breath while examining your
    fingernails.
4.  Contrive to mingle with important people.
5.  Before talking with a man you wish to impress, ferret out his remedies
    or current problems, then advocate them strongly.
6.  Listen while others wrangle.  Pluck out a platitude and defend it
    righteously.
7.  When asked a question by a subordinate, give him a "have you lost your
    mind" stare until he glances down, then paraphrase the question back at
    him.
8.  Acquire a capable stooge, but keep him in the backround.
9.  In offering to perform a service, imply your complete familiarity.
10. Arrange to be the clearinghouse for all complaints--it encourages the
    thought that you are in control.
11. Never acknowledge thanks for your attention; this will implant
    subconscious obligation in the mind of your victim.
12. Carry yourself in the grand manner.  Refer to your associates as
    "some of the boys in our office."  Discourage light conversation that
    might bridge the gap between boss and man.
13. Walk swiftly from place to place as if engrossed in affairs of great
    moment.  Keep your office door closed.  Interview by appointment only
    and give orders by memoranda.  Remember, you are a big shot and you
    don't give a damn who knows it.



Before you ask me for the day off, consider the following statistics:

There are 365 days in the year, you sleep eight hours a day making 122 days,
which subtracted from 365 days makes 243 days.  You also have 8 hours of
recreation every day, making another 122 days and leaves a balance of 121
days.  There are 52 Sundays that you do not work at all, leaving 69 days.
You get Saturday afternoon off.  This gives 52 half-days, or 26 more days
that you do not work.  This leaves a balance of 43 days.  You get an hour
off for lunch, which when totaled makes 16 days, leaving 27 days of the
year.  You get at least 21 days leave every year, so that leaves 6 days.
You get 5 legal holidays during the year, which leaves only 1 day,

                          AND YOU WANT ME TO GIVE
                          YOU THAT ONE DAY OFF!!!




               Safety Tips for the Post-Nuclear Existence

1.  Never use an elevator in a building that has been hit by a nuclear
    bomb; use the stairs.

2.  When you're flying through the air, remember to roll when you hit
    the gorund.

3.  If you're on fire, avoid gasoline and other flammable materials.

4.  Don't attempt communications with dead people; it will only lead to
    psychological problems.

5.  Food will scarce; you will have to scavenge.  Learn to recognize
    foods that will be available after the bomb: mashed potatoes, shredded
    wheat, tossed salad, ground beef, etc.

6.  Put your hand over your mouth when you sneeze; internal organs will
    be scarce in the post-nuclear age.

7.  Try to be neat; fall only in designated piles.

8.  Drive carefully in 'Heavy Fallout' areas; people could be staggering
    illegally.

9.  Nutritionaly, hundred dollar bills are equal to ones, but more
    sanitary due to limited circulation.

10. Accumulate mannequins now; spare parts will be in short supply on
    D-DAY.

Two dogs are waiting in a Vet's office, a Pit Bull and a Great Dane.  The
Great dane says to the Pit Bull, "So why are you here?" Well says the Pit
Bull, " I was sitting in my yard when this pretty young girl walked by.  I
couldn't control myself and I bit her, so they're going to put me to sleep.
" "Oh" says the Great Dane. "So why are you here?" asks the Pit Bull.  "Well"
says the Great Dane, "I was in the powder room with my mistres when se bent
over to pick her towel up." "Needless to say I couldn't controll myself and
I mounted her." "Owwww" says the Pit Bull "Thats to bad , so their going to

               The Night Before Christmas

    Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house,
    everyone felt shitty, even the mouse!

    Dad at the whore house, Mom smoking grass,
    and I just settled down for a nice piece of ass.

    Then out on the lawn there rose such a clatter,
    I sprang from my piece to see what was the matter.

    He came down the chimney like a bat out of hell,
    I knew right away that fat fucker fell.

    He filled all the stockings with pretzels and beer,
    and a big rubber dick for my brother the queer.

    He rose up the chimney with one hell of a fart,
    that son-of-a-bitch blew my chimney apart.

    He swore and he cursed as he flew out of sight,
    "Piss on you all and have one hell of a night."



A pig goes into a bar and asks for six beers and drinks them all and
asks the bartender where the bathroom is and is told by the bartender
that is down the hall.  A little while latter the pig leaves.  Then another
pig comes in and asks for twelve beers and then asks where the bathroom
is and is told that is down the hall.  A little while latter the pig
leaves.  Then a third pig enters and orders and drinks twenty-four beers
and is just about to leave when the bartender asks "hey, aren't you going
to ask where the bathroom is?" and the pig says "No, I'm the pig that
goes wee-wee all the way home."

Down in cajun country, a deputy sheriff went to the house of the old man whose 
wife was missing, and said to him "I have some good news and some bad news for 
you.  Which would you like to hear first?"

The old man replied "Give me the bad news first"

"Well," said the deputy, "we just found your wife in the river, drowned."

The old man broke down and, crying hysterically, walked away from the deputy to 
grieve.  A few minutes later he hobbled back to the deputy and asked "If that 
was the bad news, what's the good news?"

"Well" said the deputy, "when we fished her out of the water, there were ten, 
maybe twelve, big blue crabs on her... so we're sending her back down in the 
morning"

A Texan came Down Under for a holiday, and was being shown around one of the 
cattle stations in the Northern Territory.   As they were driving along, the 
Texan pointed at a cow and asked what it was. The station owner said, "That's 
one of my prize Hereford heiffers." The Texan said, "Shoot! That one wouldn't 
even be weaned yet back in Texas!"  A little while later, the Texan pointed at 
a ram and asked what it was.  The station owner said, "That's one of my stud 
Merino rams."   The Texan said, "Sheeoot! That ram is smaller than one of my 
new born lambs back in Texas!"   By this time the station owner was pretty 
pissed off, and when the Texan saw a mob of kangaroos and asked what they were, 
the station owner replied,  Grasshoppers...Incredibly LARGE grasshoppers...

Three traveling salesmen, an American, a Polack and a Black mam, were
driving down a dirt road when there car just up and died. Well, they had
seen a farm house about a mile back up the road. They all took off jogging
and got there about sun set. They knocked at the door, and a nice, elderly
farmer opened the door. They used the phone to call the local garages, but
they were all closed. Not knowing what else to do, they asked permission to
stay the night at the farmers house. They farmer said that if they wanted
to, they were welcome to stay in the barn. He showed them out to the barn,
and showed them where to stay. He then warned them to stay outta the tree
in the back yard. His daughter was getting ready to marry Billy Joe Jim
John Jake Franks, and he didn't want any peeping toms. They all easily
agreed, and went in to the barn. After about an hour of talking, they are
all very curious as to what this daughter looks like. They finally decide
to climb the tree, but quietly. When they get to the top of the tree, the
look in the window, and see this very beautiful, naked, young lady standing
in front of a mirror. They are all getting an eyefull of this big breasted,
tight assed, big bushed lady, when the farmed walkes out side, having heard
them, and yells, "Who's in that tree?". The three freeze. The American gets
an idea and, very carefully, "Meow. Meow.". The Black man, having cought on
says, "Tweet, tweet." The polack, having realized what is going on says,
"Moo! Moo! Moo!"

In the woods there's this clearing away from where all the animals live
where all the animals of the forest go to take a crap. One day this
little white fuzzy bunny rabbit was hunched over a log when this large
brown bear sits down next to him to take a shit. After a couple of
minutes this large brown bear looks down at this little white fuzzy
bunny rabbit and says "Hey, do you ever have problems with shit
sticking to your fur?" The little white fuzzy bunny rabbit looks up at
the big brown bear and replies "Uh, no I don't."  So the bear picks up
the rabbit and wipes his ass with him.

I hit his car because he got to close.

I let him try out my motorcycle. He was climbing a hill and didn't know the
hill went down the other side and crashed.

I slipped on a string bean in the supermarket. My right leg was bruised and
it's hard to walk on my lower back.

I drove my truck under a bridge and it didn't fit.

I knocked over a man. He admitted it was his fault as he'd been run over
before.

Coming home I drove into the wrong house and collided with a tree I don't
have.

The reason I have water damage is because I mistook the left side of the
bridge to be the right side.

The pedestrian didn't have any idea of which way to go, so I ran over him.

A huge tree ran out into the street and I couldn't stop in time!



A man died and was taken to his place of eternal torment by the devil. 
As he passed sulfurous pits and shrieking sinners, he saw a man he 
recognized as a layer snuggling up to a beautiful woman.
"That's unfair!" he cried.  "I have to roast for all eternity, and 
that lawyer gets to spend it with a beautiful woman."
"Shut up," barked the devil, jabbing him with his pitchfork.  "who 
are you to question that woman's punishment?" 



Two lawyers were walking along negotiating a case.  "Look," said one to the
other, "let's be honest with each other."  Okay, you first," 
 replied the other.     That was the end of the discussion.




The devil visited a young lawyer's office and made him an offer.  "I can
arrange some things for you,"  the devil said.  "I'll increase your income
five-fold.  Your partners will love you; your clients will respect you;
you'll have four months of vacation each year and live to be a hundred. 
All I require in return is that your wife's soul, your children's souls and
their children's souls must rot in hell for eternity."
 
The lawyer thought for a moment and said, "What's the catch?" 



A minister and a lawyer were chatting at a party.  "What do you do if you
make a mistake on a case?"  the minister asked.  "Try to fix it if it's big;
ignore it if it's insignificant," replied the lawyer. 
 "What do you do?"  The minister replied, "Oh, more or less the same. 
 Let me give you an example. The other day I meant to say 'the devil 
is the father of liars,' but I said instead 'the devil is the father of
lawyers,' so I let it go."

good friend Abe. And, one day, as Sol was walking down the street, he
heard a strange, yet familiar, voice from around him.

There was this Newfoundland priest hearing confessions when he had a sudden
urge to take a piss.  He didn't want to close down the confessionals so he
decides to find someone to fill on for a couple of minutes while he
relieves himself.  He looks outside and there is a janitor standing there. 
The priest asks him if he will fill in for a few minutes.  The janitor is
reluctant because he doesn't know much about the job.  The priest explains
that people come in and confess, and you just read the chart on the wall,
and give the appropriate pennance.  The janitor agrees and the priest
hurries off to the washroom.  A guy comes in and confesses to the janitor
that he has committed oral sex.  The janitor looks at the chart, but the
penalty for oral sex isn't on the list.  He didn't know what to do, so he
decided to ask someone.  He looks outside and there is a choir boy standing
there.  The janitor says "What does the Father usually give for oral sex?".
The choir boy replies "Usually just  a bag of chips and a can of Coke."

"I would like to have a tattoo made" said the customer to the
owner of the tattoo shop.  "Can you draw a $100.00 bill?"

"Sure!" said the owner.  "Just tell me where you want it; is it
going to be in your left arm, right arm, chest, or where?"

"I would like you to draw it on my pecker."

"Are you sure?" said the owner.  "It is going to hurt like @#$%^!!"
 
"Yeap!  That's where I want it."
  
"Why?" asked the owner.
 
 "Three reasons.  First, I like to fondle large bills."
 
"Allright, what's the second?
 
"Second, I like to watch my money grow."
 
"OK and what's the third."
 
 "You won't believe it, but my wife can blow one hundred bucks in a
  matter of seconds!



A protestant moved into a completly Catholic comunity.  Being good Catholics
they welcomed him to their comunity.  But, also because they were good
Catholics they did not eat red meat on Fridays.  So, when their neighbor, 
receiving his paycheck on Fridays, began barbequuing some juicy steak, they 
began to squirm.  They were so annoyed that they went to talk to him about it. 
After much talk they conviced him to become Catholic. The next Sunday he went 
to the priest and the priest sprinkled holy water on him and said :

  You were born Protestant -
  You were raised Protestant -
  But now you are Catholic.

And so, the next Friday, the neighbors sat down to eat fish and were
disturbed by the smell of roast beef from the neighboring house. They went over 
to talk to the new Catholic because he new he was not supposed to eat beef on
Fridays.  When they saw him, he was sprinlking catchup on the beef saying :

  You were born a cow -
  You were raised a cow -
  But now you are fish.



This depressed looking chap walks into a inner city bar of the cheap strong 
drink sort, sits at the bar and orders a pint of bitter.  While the bartender 
is getting the man his beer the man sort of casually takes out a tiny piano, an 
itty bitty piano bench and a teeny weeny man in a black tux to match the lot. 
The little man sits at the bench and begins to play melodiously and 
magnificently on the microscopic minute piano.  The bartender sees this and his 
eyes pop out of his head, his jaw bounces off the floor and this croaking noise 
sort of eminates from his throat as he exclaims, "Wow! That's amazing! I 
thought I'd seen it all... Where did you find that guy?"  The depressed man 
sighed and replied, "Well to make a long, sad story short... I was walking 
along the beach one day and I came across an old bottle encrusted in sea 
growth. I sort of scraped away some of the sea growth and polished it a bit, 
when suddenly to my utter astonishment a menacing genie appeared and said in a 
thunderous voice, 'Thank you, oh pitiful mortal for freeing me from that 
bottle. I shall grant you three wishes. Speak up! What will it be?' I was 
scared to death!  But I managed to get out that I would like a million bucks, 
and what do you know?  A check for a million bucks appeared, just like that in 
my hand!  Then I ordered a limo and driver. It was there as soon as the words 
left my mouth!  As far as the third wish goes, you can see the depressing 
results right there...", and the man pointed sadly toward the mini-man who was
hammering out some heavy jazz on the ivories.  The bar tender shook his head 
and said, "That's an amazing story pal, but one thing confuses me. What's so 
depressing about it all?"  The man took a deep breath as if trying not to cry 
and answered, "Well, what I really wanted was a ten inch penis..."



Q->Did you hear about the polock that broke his leg at the golf course?

A few days after Christmas a mother was working in the kitchen, listening to 
her son playing with his new electric train in the living room.  She heard the 
train stop and her son said, "All of you sons of bithches who want off, get the 
hell off now 'cause this is the last stop!  And all of you sons of bitches who 
are getting on, get your asses in the train 'cause we're leaving!"

The mother went in and told her son, "We don't use that kind of language in 
this house.   Now I want you to go to your room for two hours.  When you come 
out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice  language.

Two hours later, son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his 
train.  Soon the train stopped and the mother, who is still in the kitchen, 
heard her son say, "All passengers who are disembarking the train, please 
remember to take all of your belongings with you.  We thank you for riding with 
us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one.  We hope you will ride with us 
again soon.!  "For those of you who are just boarding, we ask you to stow all 
of your hand luggage under your seat.  Remember there is no smoking except in 
the club car.  We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us 
today.  For those of you who are pissed off about the two hour delay, please 
see the Bitch in the kitchen."



        NEW COMPANY POLICY
        ==================
 
 The personnel department of this organization will apply a new
 program to all employees starting immediately.
 
 The program is designed to phase out many jobs of this organization
 although no prior official announcement will be made, and will
 be called R.A.P.E. (Retire All Personnel Early).
 
 All employees who are "RAPEd" will have an opportunity to seek
 other employment and will be able to request a review of their
 records before discharge.  This phase of the cut-back is dubbed
 S.C.R.E.W. (Survey of Capabilities of Retired Early Workers).
 
 One last chance is promised by this organization to employees who
 have been SCREWed or RAPEd.  They may appeal for a final review
 called S.H.A.F.T. (Study by Higher Authority Following Termination).
 
 Employees who are RAPEd may be allowed only one additional SCREWing
 but may request the SHAFT as many times as they desire.

Two men go into the doctor's office and sit beside each other.. After a while 
they are talking up a storm, and 1 guy says, "I'm in here cuz I have a red ring 
around my dick and I don't know what it is!"  "Well, I'm in here because I have 
a green ring around my dick!  What a coincedence" the second exclaimed.  So the 
1st guy goes into the office, and 15 minutes later he comes out and says to the 
second man, "It's fine! Nothing to worry about!"   Relieved, the second guy 
goes in, and comes back out crying.
     "What happened in there?" the first guy asks
     "Well, there's a big difference between Lipstick and Gangreen!"



Three guy die and goto hell because of their perverse actions when they
were alive.  They meet with the devil and he strikes them a deal,"I'll let
you go to heaven if you can walk 100 stories of stairs without getting a
hard-on." These guys think it's a breeze.  The only problem is that on
every landing is a naked lady.  So the fist guy takes his shot and doesn't
even make it past the first stair and already pops a rod.  The Devil asks
"Well, what did your father do for a living?"  The man replied "He was a
Carpenter" so the devil takes a saw and saws his dick off.  The next guy
goes and makes it to the 49th floor, but can take it any more and up she
goes.  The devil asks" Well, what did YOUR father do fo a living?"  The
man replies "He was a butcher" so out comes the clever and <whack> he has
no more dick.  The third guy gives it a shot but at the 59th floor he can't 
hold out anymore.  He starts laughing and the devil asks why.  He says "my dad 
was a lolipop maker and you have to suck my dick off!"

Mrs. Van Horn inherited Penrod, a parrot that swore.  After several 
embarrassing experiences (which will not be featured on this board), she told 
her minister about the problem. "I have a female parrot who is a saint," he 
said.  "She sits on her perch and prays all day.  Bring your parrot over.  
Mine'll be a good influence."

The woman brought Penrod to the minister's home.  When the cages were placed 
together, Penrod cried, "Hi baby! Hows about a little lovin'?" "Great!" replied 
the female parrot.  "Thats just what I've been prayin' for!."
