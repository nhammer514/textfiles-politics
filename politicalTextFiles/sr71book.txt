Here is a list all the books and magazines I have that contain articles on
the Blackbirds.  Most of these books are available at hobby stores or from
Aerofax, Inc (817-261-1905), Zenith Books (800-826-6600) and Historical
Aviation (800-225-5575) mailorder book stores.  A few were obtained at the
AF Museum and the National Air and Space Museum.  I'll try to list them in
order of which ones Ifeel provide the most info (hopefully also most accurate
info).  This list was last updated on December 6, 1991.

There must be dozens of SR-71 articles in Aviation Week & Space Technology.
I haven't collected many of these yet so I'm not listing any of them.  Others
are urged to list which issues have articles.  Also I'm sure I left out a few
entries here and there.  I have taken many color photos of SR-71 64-17976 which
is on display at the Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio.  I could make them
available for a nominal fee if anyone is interested.  Also willing to trade
some for pictures of the F-117! My address: Albert H. Dobyns, 717 Wehrli Drive,
Naperville, IL 60540. Home phone number is 708-369-0206.
