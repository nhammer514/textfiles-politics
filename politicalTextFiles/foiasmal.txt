Ok...  You have to write a letter.  It goes a little something like this..
Attn: F.B.I.

This is a request under provisions of Title 5 USC, Sec. 552, the Freedom of 
Information Act, and Title 5 USC, Sec 552a, the Privacy Act.

Please furnish me with copies of all records on me retrievable by the use of 
an individual identifier and by the use of any combination of identifiers 
(e.g. name + date of birth + social security number, etc.) that are contained 
in the following systems of records:

In order to identify myself and to facilitate your search of records systems, 
I provide the following information:

Name
Address
City, State, Zip
Birthdate
Birthplace
Sex
Social Security Number

In the event that any part of my records are withheld, I request a complete 
list of all records being withheld and the specific exemption claimed for the 
withholding of each.

In the event that the search and copying fees are estimated to exceed $25, I 
request an opportunity to review such records, or to have a duly authorized 
representative review such records, in order to select those to be copied.

If you have any questions regarding this request, please telephone me at 
(daytime phone number) weekdays or write to me at the above address.

As provided for by Sec. 552(a)(6)(i) of the Freedom of Information Act, I 
shall expect to recieve a reply within ten (10) business days.

Ok, now on the back of this letter, you must have a NOTARIZED signature, which 
means you have to go to a notary (there's one at the DMV), sign it in front of 
him/her, and present a picture ID, usually drivers license, and have them 
stamp it.

Send the letter to:
                                     F.B.I.
                                  FOIA Section
                      10th Street and Pennsylvania Ave, NW
                                   Room 6296
                            Washington, D.C.  20535
That's it.  And please, if anyone else does this, tell me if your envelope was 
opened and resealed with fucking scotch tape before it was delivered to you.  
Mine was, and it really makes me wonder..
