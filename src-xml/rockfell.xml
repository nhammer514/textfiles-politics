      <p> EXPOSE: <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate - Secret Govt pt 1 (53K)</p>
      <p>This text is being posted with the intent to EDUCATE those of you who
know not the silent and pervasive influence of your hidden masters. Some
have looked for shadows of the old illuminati; they look amiss, not seeing
that which is all around them. If you know not the "who" and the "why",
efforts will be mis-directed. This is NOT a "conspiracy"..nay, it is a
very cold and calculated NETWORK of individuals whose intent is nothing
short of implementation of a "New World Order"; an oligarchic rein in which
*you* serve as little more that slaves in their "technocracy". This network
has every intention to implement a cashless society, for it is they who
control every aspect of finance and banking over the entire globe. They
have had about 100 years to perfect their plans and put them into practice.

Please understand that the Bilderbergers, the Council on Foreign Relations,
the Tri-lateral Commission,the Institute for Policy Studies, the <ent type='ORG'>Roundtables</ent>,
the "Club of Rome",etc are ALL bound by common denominators of long-standing
families ties, and interests and come together as a _single_ policy making
body that is known today as "The Committee of 300" . This has also been
known as "The Olympians", the "Policy Committee".

Don't be mis-led by labels such as "<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>" or "Rothschild"; for these
are simply the families who have the mechanisms of control already set in
place,but of themselves are not the entire network; that being the
"Committee of 300". It is THEY who control the UN, who tell the heads of
nations "when to jump and how high", they who are behind the world's illicit
drug trade via the CIA and the old <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> East India links. They who
manage the IMF,set policy at GATT conferences. It is they who ARE the
"Shadow Government". It is they who manage the CIA,NSA,DIA..the same
group that took out JFK and have MURDERED around 173 people in their efforts
to suppress the truth about all the links..they who were behind the
assassination of <ent type='PERSON'>RFK</ent>,<ent type='PERSON'>MLK</ent>..they who are behind the suppression of truth
regarding the MIA's; It is the same group behind E. Howard Hunt,
John Singlaub, Ollie <ent type='LOC'>North</ent>..the very same group who brought down Richard
Nixon in Watergate..the same group behind the persecution of the Christic
Institute..the same people who were behind Nugan-Hand..the same group
that groomed Jimmy Carter for the Presidency..the same group who ARE
the "Military-Industrial complex", the same group behind the total
militarization of NASA..the same group who ARE "MJ-12", were behind the
"Jason Group"..the same behind Project Blue Book, The Condon Committee,
the same who started up the NSA..who are responsible for the MURDER of
Danny Casalaro..the same group responsible for the world-wide DISINFO
campaign regarding the TRUTH of <ent type='EVENT'>UFO</ent> sightings and contacts. The very
SAME group who OWN THE MEDIA..ie..The Washington Post, NBC (General
Electric),<ent type='ORG'>ABC</ent>,<ent type='ORG'>CBS</ent>,The <ent type='ORG'>New York Times</ent>,etc. The same group behind the
the Warren Commission,ad nauseum..

I DO believe I could make a DIRECT connection here with just what
CIABASE says on <ent type='ORG'>WACKENHUT</ent> that also ties in the Shadow Government
with <ent type='EVENT'>UFO</ent> related installations; this is but *ONE* connection..there
are many,many more that can be and will be ferreted out for exposure.</p>

      <p> &gt; <ent type='ORG'>Wackenhut</ent> Corp., one of the nation's largest security firms, said Friday
&gt; it has bought the U.S. security operations of ISS International Service
&gt; System Inc. The purchase price was not disclosed. ISS International
&gt; has more than 700 employees in its U.S. security operations, primarily
&gt; in Jacksonville, Los Angeles, Dallas, Atlanta, Cleveland and

      <p>In several investigations that I am currently involved in for <ent type='EVENT'>UFO</ent> Magazine as
well as my radio show "<ent type='EVENT'>UFO</ent>s Tonite", I have come across the <ent type='ORG'>Wackenhut</ent>
connection. As many of you may know, <ent type='ORG'>Wackenhut</ent> is responsible for outside
security around Area 51 and site S-4. Last year there was a helicopter crash
in Las Vegas that killed a number of <ent type='ORG'>Wackenhut</ent> employees, plus they are

      <p>This is not the entire article, only the highlights. If you would like to
read this article in its entirety please refer to the above publication.</p>
      <p>The word out of the Bilderberg annual meeting is that there will be another
war within the next five years.</p>
      <p>It was repeatedly stated at the Bilderberg meeting that there will be
"other Saddams" in the years ahead who must be dealt with swiftly and
efficiently.</p>
      <p>The Bilderberg group plans a global army at the disposal of the United
Nations. It is their hope that the U.N. will become the world government
by the year 2000.</p>
      <p>"A U.N. army must be able to act immediately, anywhere in the world, without
delays involved in each country making its own decision whether to
participate, based on parochial considerations," said Henry Kissinger.</p>
      <p>If Americans can be persuaded to surrender warmaking decisions to the U.N.,
"parochial nationalism" in <ent type='GPE'>Briton</ent>, France and elsewhere will disappear,
Bilderberg speakers said.</p>
      <p>"The Persian Gulf venture has advanced the cause by years" one speaker said.</p>

      <p>The following is on the historical perspective of just the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
and Rothschild connections and in no way attempts to cover every
aspect, but will suffice to give you a basis on which to understand
how pervasive the Web of influence is and that it is a good deal MORE
than "merely a conspiracy". Just WHO makes up the ILLEGAL SHADOW
GOVERMNENT,YOUR HIDDEN MASTERS?</p>
      <p>I ask no one to accept any of this at face value, and would heartily
encourage you to perform your own investigation. To that end,I've
provided an extensive list of reading materials at the end of this
text.

And lastly, I would include a very lucid assessment of our situation
by John DiNardo, which in my opinion, is absolutely correct. There have
been MANY people who are posting such as John, Dave Radcliffe, Rich
Winkel and others who have been showing you just *WHO* the CANCER IS.</p>
      <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the usurpers of our freedom, the plunderers of our life's earnings,
the despoilers of our planet Earth, the deluders of our TV-zombified
society, the desecrators of our Constitution can crush the Christic
Institute -- than what refuge is left for the few remaining
Christic-like organizations to shelter THEM from this Frankenstein
Monster government? What refuge is left for you and me, and for our
children who will necessarily find themselves forced to riot and
spill their blood in the streets during the twenty-first century?
It always degenerates to that, you know.</p>
      <p> We Americans are a lazy, short-sighted bunch. We realize that if we
don't earn a living, we will be impoverished. We realize that if we
don't brush our teeth, our teeth will rot out of our mouths. We
realize that if we don't service our cars, they will fail to operate.
Yet, we don't realize -- or we're too lazy to admit -- that if we
don't supervise and participate in our system of government to ensure
that our Constitution is protected from the greedy, power-mad
neurotics whose ambitions drive them to seize the reins of power
and wealth vested in our Federal Government, then our libertarian
foundations will crumble beneath us, leaving us to fall into the
pit of subjugation that the corporate rulers have prepared for us.</p>
      <p> As we witness our free-fall into the pit, we finally understand
that the law is slipping out of our hands; that we and our children
will have to resort to meeting in dark rooms and plotting to recover
our Constitutional freedoms which the usurpers have seized through
television, that great national Svengali -- that opiate of the masses
which they have so cleverly employed to sedate, delude and distract us
while quietly cuffing our ankles and wrists. How could we be so stupid
as to surrender our minds to Big Brother, never suspecting that
whenever someone offers you free entertainment, day after day and
year after year, it's got to be costing you. </p>
      <p> Why shouldn't we be as vulnerable to totalitarianism as are
the peoples of most other societies around the world. More so,
considering the fact that totalitarianism originates from within the
military elite. And whose nation has the most savagely powerful
military force on the planet? What's worse is that it's not just the
military that's militating against our Constitutional freedoms.
It's the military-industrial complex. President Eisenhower left office
a third of a century ago by warning us that the military-industrial
complex is the greatest threat to our freedom. That was as much of
a warning as he dared give, lest he meet the doom of his valiant
successor who tried to actually BE the President of the United States.</p>
      <p> How knowledgeable was the General of the Army of the Second World War,
Dwight Eisenhower, in his fear of the military-industrial complex?
As knowledgeable as President Kennedy is dead!</p>
      <p> So you see, there really isn't much time left. If we prove to be too
lazy now to unite behind Constitutional upholders such as the
Christic Institute -- then our children in the twenty-first century
will NOT be too frightened to stand up against the bullets of the
<ent type='ORG'>Wackenhut</ent> Security Corporation of Coral Gables, Florida. Because
when the oppression becomes intolerable, you, I and anyone would
stand up to bullets, rather than go on living in unbearable agony.
Ask the Palestinian people who stand up to bullets every day --
or the Rumanian people, or the Guatemalan people, or the Filipino
people, or the Chinese people, or the Iranian people, or the
Tibetan people, or the Timorese people.</p>
      <p> If we prove to be too lazy now, OUR generation may even see the day
when citizens will speak softly and listen intently for the footsteps
of the Gestapo who may finally come to kick down our front door and
arrest us for plotting to regain the Constitutional freedoms
that were once our heritage.</p>
      <p> John DiNardo</p>
      <p> Excerpted from the book, "Rape of The Constitution; Death of Freedom" by
Gyeorgos C. Hatonn . </p>
      <p> *** The <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate ***</p>
      <p> Many American conservatives believe as a matter of faith that the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s and the Council on Foreign Relations exercise absolute
control over the government and the people of the U.S. This thesis can
be accepted as a working formula if one remains conscious of the larger
issues. Two writers for whom the present writer (E.M) has great respect,
Dr. Emanuel Josephson and Morris Bealle, insisted on focusing on the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s and excluding all other aspects of the World Order. This
severely limited the effect of their otherwise groundbreaking work on the
Medical Monopoly. This writer advanced a contrary view in "The World
Order," fixing upon the Rothschild monetary power, which reached a point
of world control by 1885, and its London policy group, the Royal
Institute of International Affairs, as the policy makers for what has
essentially been, since 1900, a re-established colonial government,
functions primarily through the Council on Foreign Relations, but only as
the subsidiary of RIIA and through the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation, which
controls government functions, the educational establishments, the media,
the religions and the state legislatures. </p>
      <p> It is true that the American colonials have "free elections," in which
they have the absolute right to vote for one of two opposing candidates,
both of whom have been handpicked and financed by the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
syndicate. This touching evidence of "democracy" serves to convince most
Americans that you are indeed a free people. You even have a cracked
Liberty Bell in Philadelphia to prove it. American youths have been free
since 1900 to be marched off to die in Hegelian wars in which both
combatants received their instructions from the World Order. You are free
to invest in a stock market in which the daily quantity,price and value
of the monetary unit is manipulated and controlled by a Federal Reserve
System which is answerable only to the Bank of England. It has maintained
its vaunted "independence" from your government control, but this is the
only independence it has ever had. </p>
      <p> The realization that you do indeed live under the dictates of the
"<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate" can well be the starting point of the long road
back of a genuine struggle for American independence. In exposing "the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s" as agents of a foreign power, which is not merely a foreign
power, but a genuine world government, you must realize that this is not
merely a group dedicated to making money, but a group which is committed
to maintaining the power of a colonial form of government over the
American people. Thus the ancient calumny of John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> as a
man obsessed by greed (a category in which he has plenty of company)
obscures the fact that from the day the Rothschilds began to finance his
march towards a total oil monopoly in the United States from their
coffers at the National City Bank of Cleveland, <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> was never an
independent power, nor does any department of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate
operate as an independent power. You know that the Cosa Nostra, or
Mafia, with which the Syndicate is closely allied, has somewhat
autonomous power in the regions which have been assigned to that
particular "family" by the national directors, but this always implies
that that family remains under total control and answerable for
everything which occurs in its territory. </p>
      <p> Similarly, the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate operates under clearly defined
spheres of influence. The "charitable" organizations, the business
companies and the policy groups, always meld into a working operation,
nor can any department of the Syndicate strike out on its own or
formulate an independent policy, no matter what may be its
justification. </p>
      <p> The <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate operates under the control of the world
financial structure, which means that on any given day, all of its assets
could be rendered close to worthless by adroit financial manipulation.
This is the final control, which ensures that no one can quit the
organization. Not only would he be stripped of all assets, but he would
be under contract for immediate assassination. The Department of Justice
is well aware that the only "terrorists" operating in the United States
are the agents of the World Order, but they prudently avoid any mention
of this fact. </p>
      <p> The world financial structure, far from being an unknown or hidden
organization, is actually well known and well defined. It consists of
the major Swiss Banks; the survivors of the old Venetian-Genoese banking
axis; the Big Five of the world grain trade; the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> combine,
centered in the Bank of England and its chartered merchant banks,
functioning through the Rothschilds and the Oppenheimers and having
absolute control over their Canadian colony through the Royal Bank of
<ent type='GPE'>Canada</ent> and the Bank of <ent type='GPE'>Montreal</ent>, their Canadian lieutenants being the
Bronfmans, Belzbergs, Reichmanns and other financial operators; and the
colonial banking structure in the U.S., controlled by the Bank of England
through the Federal Reserve System; the Boston Brahmin families who made
their fortunes in the opium trade, including the Delanos and others and
the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank, American Express, the present
form of the old Rothschild representatives in the U.S., which includes
Kuhn,Loeb Company and Lehman Brothers. </p>
      <p> It is notable that the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate is far down on the list of
the worlds financial structure. Why then is it of such importance?
Although it is not the crucial factor in financial decision in the
Western Hemisphere, it is the actual working control mechanism of the
American colony. The <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> family themselves,like the
Morgans,Schiffs and Warburgs, have faded into insignificance, but the
mechanism created in their name roars along at full power,still
maintaining all of the functions for which it was organized. Since he
set up the Trilateral Commission, David <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> has functioned as a
sort of international courier for the World Order, principally concerned
with delivering working instructions to the Communist bloc,either
directly, in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> or by traveling to the area. Laurence <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
is active in the operation of the Medical Monopoly, but his principal
interests are in operating various vacation spas in tropical areas. They
are the two survivors of the "Fortunate Five," the five sons of John D.
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, Jr. and Abby Aldrich. John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, Jr. died in an
institution in Tucson,Arizona and was hastily cremated. John D.
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> III died in a mysterious accident on a <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> Parkway near
his home. Nelson <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, named after his grandfather, died in the
arms of a TV journalist. It was later revealed that he had also been in
the arms of another TV journalist at the same time; the death was hushed
up for many hours. It was generally believed that he ran afoul of his
<ent type='GPE'>Columbian</ent> drug connection, the disagreement hardly being trivial; it
involved several billion dollars in drug profits which had not been
properly apportioned. Winthrop <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> died an alcoholic in the arms
of his black boy friend. He had been interviewed on television by Harry
Reasoner to explain his hasty move from <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> to Arkansas. Winthrop
learned that his black boy friend, an Army sergeant who apparently taught
him the mysteries of drill,refused to live in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>. To celebrate this
alliance, Winthrop <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> gave magnificiently to Negro
causes,including the Urban League building on East 48th Street in New
York. A plaque on the second floor notes that it was his gift; it might
well have stated "From Hadrian to his Antinous." </p>
      <p> We do not wish to imply that the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s no longer have influence,
but that the major policy dictates of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate are
handed down by other caps, of whom they continue to be a visible force.
Through the person of David <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, the family is sometimes called
"the first family of the Soviet Union." Only he and Dr. Armand Hammer,
the moving force behind USTEC, have permanent permission to land their
private planes at the Moscow Airport. Others would suffer the fate of KAL
007. David <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s most significant trip to the Soviet Union may
have been the fateful day when he landed in Moscow, having been told to
inform Khrushchev that he was "through". The <ent type='NORP'>Russians</ent> are very health
conscious, and a scientist had sent information to Khrushchev that the
use of chemical fertilizers in the Soviet Union presented a threat to the
people. Khrushchev then announced a major change in the Soviet farm
policy, centering around a reduction in the use of chemicals. This was
upsetting to the head of the world's Chemical Fertilizer trust, David
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, and he responded with a terse one word command, "Out". </p>
      <p> Both the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> family fortune and the considerable portion set
aside in the foundations of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate are effectively
insulated against any type of government control. FORTUNE magazine noted
August ,1986, that John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>,Jr. had created trusts in 1934
which now amounted to some $2.3 billion; another 200 million had been set
aside for the Abby <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> branch. The five sons had trusts which in
1986 amounted to $2.1 billion. These trusts had originally amounted to
only $50 million each,showing the increase in their assets as well as
inflation during the ensuing half century. FORTUNE estimated the 1986
total <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> wealth as $3.5 billion of which $900 million was in
securities and real estate. They owned 45% of the Time Life
Building; Nelson <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s International Basic Economy Corporation had
been sold to a <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> company in 1980. For years, the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> family
had deliberately kept the rents low in its major holding, <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
Center, a $1.6 billion investment yielding an annual return of 1% . This
was a convenient manuever for tax purposes, and a good one at that. </p>
      <p> Much of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> wealth might be attributed to old John D.'s
rapacity and ruthlessness; its origins are indubitably based in his
initial financing from the National City Bank of Cleveland, which was
identified in Congressional reports as one of the three Rothschild banks
in the United States and by his later acceptance of the guidance of Jacob
Schiff of Kuhn,Loeb Company, who had been born in the Rothschild house in
Franfort and was now the principal Rothschild representive (but unknown
as such to the public) in the United States. </p>
      <p> With the seed money from the National City Bank in Cleveland, old John D.
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> soon laid claim to the title of the "most ruthless American".
It is more than likely that it was this quality which persuaded the
Rothschilds to back him. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> realized early in the game that the
oil refinery business, which could offer great profits in a short time,
also was at the mercy of uncontrolled competition. His solution was a
simple one--crush all competition. The famous <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> dedication to
total monopoly was simply a business decision. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> embarked on a
campaign of coercing all competing oil refineries out of business. He
attacked on a number of fronts, which is also a lesson to all would be
entrepreneurs. First, he would send a minion, not known to be working for
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, with an offer to buy the competing refinery for a low
price,but offering cash. If the offer was refused, the competitor would
then come under attack from a competing refinery which greatly undercut
his price. He might also suffer a sudden strike at his refinery,which
would force him to shut down. Control of labor through unions has always
been a basic <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> technique. Like the Soviet Union, they seldom
have labor trouble. If these techniques failed, <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> would then
be saddened by a reluctant decision to use violence; beating the rival
workers as they went to and from their jobs, or burning or blowing up the
competing refinery. </p>
      <p> These techniques convinced the Rothschilds that they had found their
man.They sent their personal representative,Jacob Schiff, to Cleveland to
help <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> plan further expansion. At this time,the Rothschilds
controlled 95% of all railroad mileage in the United States,through the
J.P. Morgan Company and Kuhn Loeb Company,according to official
Department of Commerce figures for the year 1895. J.P. Morgan mentions in
his "Who's Who" listing that he controlled 50000 miles of U.S.
railways. Schiff worked out an elaborate rebate deal for
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>,through a dummy corporation,South Improvement Company. These
rebates ensured that no other oil company could survive in competition
with the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> firm. The scheme was later exposed,but by that time
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had achieved a virtual monopoly of the oil business in the
U.S. The daughter of one of his victims, Ida Tarbell,whose father was
ruined by <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s criminal operations, wrote the first major expose
of the Standard Oil Trust. She was promptly denounced as a "muckracker"
by the poseur, Theodore Roosevelt, who claimed to be a "trustbuster." In
fact, he ensured the dominance of the Standard Oil Trust and other giant
trusts. </p>
      <p> During the next half century, John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> was routinely
caricatured by socialist propagandists as the epitome of the ruthless
capitalist. At the same time, he was the principal financier of the
world Communist movement, through a firm called American International
Company. Despite the fact that the House of Rothschild had already
achieved world control,the sound and the fury was directed exclusively
against its two principal representatives,John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> and J.P.
Morgan. One of the few revelations of the actual state of affairs
appeared in TRUTH magazine,Dec 161912, which pointed out that "Mr.
Schiff is head of the great private banking house of Kuhn, Loeb Company
(I knew some of you bright readers would finally pick up that these names
are all attached to the greatest pharmaceutical firms in the world--even
into your very vitamin supplement business!), which represents the
Rothschild interests on your side of the Atlantic. He is described as a
financial strategist and has been for years the financial minister of the
great impersonal power known as Standard Oil." Note that the name of
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> was not mentioned in the quote. </p>
      <p> Because of these concealed factors,it was a relatively simple matter for
the American public to accept the "fact" that the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s were the
preeminent power in your country. This myth was actually clothed in the
apparel of power,the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Oil Trust becoming the
"military-industrial complex" which assumed political control of the
nation; the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Medical Monopoly attained control of the health
care of the nation, and the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation, a web of affiliated
tax emempt creations, effectively controlled the religious and
educational life of the nation. The myth succeeded in its goal of
camouflaging the hidden rulers, the Rothschilds. </p>
      <p> After Eustis Mullins and a few others, had been exposing this charade for
some twenty-five years a new myth began to be noised about in American
conservative circles, effectively propagated by active double agents.
This myth found a host of eager believers,because it heralded a growing
crack in the monolithic power which had been oppressing all the peoples
of the world. This "new" revelation was that a struggle to the death for
world power had developed between the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s and the Rothschilds.
According to this startling development, one faction or the other,
depending on which agent you were listening to, had gained control of the
Soviet Union and would use its power as the basis for achieving the
overthrow of the other faction. The sudden death of several members of
the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> family was cited as "proof" that such a struggle was
taking place, although no Rothschild is known to have succumbed during
this "war." This ignored the general understanding that Nelson
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had been "eliminated" as the result of losing deposit slips
for several billion dollars of drugs from the <ent type='GPE'>Columbian</ent> cartel, or that
the other <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> deaths showed no trace of a "Rothschild
connection." </p>
      <p> Having maintained extensive files on this situation for several decades,
the writer (E.M.),could not believe anyone could be so misinformed as to
think that "the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s" were now trying to seize power from the
Rothschilds, at a time when the influence of members of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
family was already in great decline, their family finances being handled
by John J. McCloy, and other faithful retainers;none of the retainers
would have been willing to engage in a genuine power struggle, as they
were faceless managers who lived only for their weekly paycheck. They
had no ambitions of their own. Nevertheless, many hopeful Americans
grasped at the will-o-the-wisp notion the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s were now "good
Americans" who were willing to risk all to overthrow the Rothschilds.
Amazingly enough, this pernicious story persisted for almost a decade
before being relegated to the curiosities of history. </p>
      <p> Like J.P. Morgan, who had begun his commercial career by selling the U.S.
Army some defective guns, the famous Hall carbine affair, John D.
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> also was a war profiteer during the Civil War;he sold
unstamped Harkness liquor to Federal troops at a high profit, gaining the
initial capital to embark on his drive for monopoly. His interest in the
oil business was a natural one; his father,William <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had been
"in oil" for years. William <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had become an oil entrepreneur
after salt wells at Tarentum, near Pittsburgh, were discovered in 1842 to
be flowing with oil. The owners of the wells,Samuel L. Kier, began to
bottle the oil and sell it for medicinal purposes. One of his earliest
wholesalers was William <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>. The "medicine" was originally
labelled "Kier's Magic Oil". <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> printed his own labels, using
"Rock Oil" or "Seneca Oil", Seneca being the name of a well known <ent type='NORP'>Indian</ent>
Tribe. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> achieved his greatest notoriety and his greatest
profits by advertising himself as "William <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, the Celebrated
Cancer Specialist". It is understandable that his grandsons would become
the controlling power behind the scenes of the world's most famous cancer
treatment center and would direct government funds and charitable
contributions to those areas which only benefit the Medical Monopoly.
William <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> spared no claim in his flamboyant career. He
guaranteed "All Cases of Cancer Cured Unless They Are Too Far Gone". Such
were the healing powers that he attributed to his magic cancer cure that
he was able to retail it for $25 a bottle, a sum then equivalent to two
month's wages. The "cure" consisted of a few well known diuretics, which
had been diluted by water. This carnival medicine show barker could
hardly have envisioned that his descendants would control the greatest
and the most profitable Medical Monopoly in recorded history. </p>
      <p> As an itinerant "carnie", a traveling carnival peddler, William
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had chosen a career which interfered with developing a stable
family life. His son, John, rarely saw him, a circumstance which has
inspired some psychological analysts to conjecture that the absence of a
father figure or parental love may have contributed to John D.
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s subsequent development as a money mad tyrant who plotted to
maim, poison and kill millions of his fellow Americans during almost a
century of his monopolistic operations and whose influence, reaching up
from the grave, remains the most dire and malignant presence in American
life. This may have been a contributing factor--however, it is also
possible that he was totally evil. It is hardly arguable that he is
probably one of the most Satanic figures in American history. Evil being
defined as anything that moves the spiritual aspect of beingness away
from God as influenced through another. </p>
      <p> It has long been a truism that you can find a horse thief or two in any
prominent American family. In the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> family, it was more than
true in the case of William who seemed to have faithfully followed the
precepts of the Will of Canaan throughout his career, "love robbery, love
lechery". He fled from a number of indictments for horse stealing and
you know how serious that is, finally disappearing altogether as William
and <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> and magically re-emerging as a Dr. William Levingston of
Philadelphia, a name which he retained for the rest of his life. An
investigative reporter at Joseph Pulitzer's <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> World received a tip
that was followed up. The World then disclosed that William Avery
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had died May 11, 1906 in Freeport, Illinois, where he was
interred in an unmarked grave as Dr. William Levingston. </p>
      <p> William <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s vocation as a medicine man greatly facilitated his
preferred profession of horse thief. As one who planned to be in the
next county by morning, it was a simple matter to tie a handsome stallion
to the back of his wagon and head for the open road. It also played a
large part in his vocation as a woman-chaser; he was described as being
"woman-mad". </p>
      <p> On June 281849, he was indicted for raping a hired girl in Cayuga,New
York; he later was found to be residing in Oswego, <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> and was
forced once again to decamp for parts unknown. He had no difficulty in
financing his woman-chasing interests from the sale of his miraculous
cancer cure and from another product, his "Wonder Working Liniment",
which he offered at only two dollars a bottle. It consisted of crude
petroleum from which the lighter oils had been boiled away, leaving a
heavy solution of paraffin,lube oil and tar, which comprised the
"liniment". William <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s original miracle oil survived until
quite recently as a concoction called Nujol, consisting principally of
petroleum and peddled as a laxative. It was well known that Nujol was
merely an advertising sobriquet meaning "new oil", as opposed apparently,
to "old oil". Sold as an antidote to constipation, it robbed the body of
fat-soluble vitamins, it being a well-established medical fact that
mineral oil coated the intestine and prevented the absorption of many
needed vitamins and other nutritional needs. Its makers added carotine
as a sop to the health-conscious, but it was hardly worth the bother.
Nujol was manufactured by a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey,
called Stanco, whose only other product, manufactured on the same
premises, was the famous insecticide, Flit. </p>
      <p> Nujol was hawked from the Senate Office Building in Washington for years
during a more liberal interpretation of "conflict of interest". In this
case, it was hardly a conflict of interest, because the august
peddler,Senator Royal S. Copeland, never had any interests other than
serving the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s. He was a physician whom <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had
appointed as head of the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> State Department of Health and later
financed his campaign for the Senate. Copeland's frank display of
commercialism amazed even the most blase' Washington reporters. </p>
      <p> He devoted his Senate career to a daily program advertising Nujol. A
microphone was set up in his Senate office each morning, the first order
of business being the Nujol program, for which he was paid $75000 a
year, an enormous salary in the 1930's and more than the salary of the
President of the United States. Senator Copeland's exploits earned him a
number of nicknames on Capital Hill. He was often called the Senator from
the American Medical Association, because of his enthusiastic backing for
any program launched by the AMA and Morris Fishbein. More realistically,
he was usually referred to as "the Senator from Standard Oil". He could
be counted on to promote any legislation devised for the greater profit
of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> monopoly. During congressional debate on the Food and
Drug Act in 1938, he came under criticism from Congresswoman Leonor
Sullivan, who charged that Senator Copeland, a physician who handled the
bill on the Senate floor, frankly acknowledged during the debate that
soap was exempted from the law because the soap manufacturers, who were
the nation's largest advertisers, would otherwise join with other big
industries to fight the bill. Congresswoman Sullivan complained that,
"Soap was officially declared in the law not to be a cosmetic. The hair
dye manufacturers were given a license to market known dangerous
products, just so long as they placed a special warning on the label -
but what woman in a beauty parlor ever sees the label on the bulk
container in which hair dye is shipped?" </p>
      <p> Just as the elder <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had spent his life in the pursuit of his
personal obsession, women, so his son John was equally obsessed, being
money-mad instead of woman-mad, totally committed to the pursuit of
ever-increasing wealth and power. However, the principal accomplishments
of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> drive for power, the rebate scheme for monopoly, the
chartering of the foundations to gain power over American citizens,the
creation of the central bank, the Federal Reserve System, the backing of
the World Communist Revolution and the creation of the Medical Monoply,
all came from the Rothschilds or from their European employees. </p>
      <p> We cannot find in the records of John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> that he originated
any of these programs. The concept of the tax exempt charitable
foundation originated with the Rothschild minion, George Peabody, in
1865. The Peabody Educational Foundation later became the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
Foundation and many of you should recall that item. Not that you might
have been around then but it continues to inadvertently be referred to as
such. </p>
      <p> It is unlikely that even the diabolical mind of John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> could
have conceived of this devious twist. A social historian has described
the major development of the late nineteenth century, when charitable
foundations and world Communism became important movements, as one of the
more interesting facets of history, perhaps equivalent to the discovery
of the wheel or fire. This new discovery was the concept developed by
the rats, who after all have rather highly developed intelligences, that
they could trap people by baiting traps with little bits of cheese. The
history of mankind since then has been the rats catching humans in their
traps. Socialism -- indeed, any government program -- is simply the rat
baiting the trap with a smidgeon of cheese and catching himself a human. </p>
      <p> Congressman Wright Patman, chairman of the House Banking and Currency
Committee, noted from the floor of Congress that the establishment of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation effectively insulated Standard Oil from
competition. The controlling stock had been removed from market
manipulation or possible buyouts by competitors. It also relieved
Standard Oil from most taxation, which then placed a tremendous added
burden on individual American taxpayers. Although a <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> relative
by marriage, Senator Nelson Aldrich, Republican majority leader in the
Senate, had pushed the General Education Board charter through Congress,
the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation charter proved to be more difficult.
Widespread criticism of <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s monopolistic practices was heard,
and his effort to insulate his profits from taxation or takeover was seen
for what it was. The charter was finally pushed through in 1913 (the
significant <ent type='NORP'>Masonic</ent> numeral 13 -- 1913 was also the year of the
progressive income tax and of the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act).
Senator Robert F. Wagner of <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>, another Senator from Standard Oil
(there were quite a few), ramrodded the Congressional approval of the
charter. The charter was then signed by John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, John D.
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, Jr., Henry Pratt Judson, president of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
established University of Chicago,Simon Flexner, director of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Institute, Starr Jameson, described in "Who's Who" as
"personal counsel to John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> in his benevolences", and
Charles W. Eliot, president of Harvard University. </p>
      <p> The <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Oil Monopoly is now 127 years old, yet in 1911, the
Supreme Court, bowing to public outrage, had ruled that it had to be
broken up. The resulting companies proved to be no problem for the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> interests. The family retained a two per cent holding in
each of the "new" companies, while the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> foundations took a
three per cent holding in each company. This gave them a five per cent
stock interest in each company; a one per cent holding in a corporation
is usually sufficient to maintain working control. </p>
      <p> The involvement of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s in promoting the World Communist
Revolution also developed from their business interests. There was never
any commitment to the Marxist ideology; like anything else, it was there
to be used. At the turn of the century, Standard Oil was competing
fiercely with Royal Dutch Shell for control of the lucrative European
market. Congressional testimony revealed that <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had sent large
sums of money to Lenin and Trotsky to instigate the Communist Revolution
in 1905. His banker, Jacob Schiff had previously financed the <ent type='NORP'>Japanese</ent> in
their war against Russia and had sent a personal emissary, George Kennan
to Russia to spend some twenty years in promoting revolutionary activity
against the Czar. </p>
      <p> When the 1905 revolution failed, Lenin was placed "in storage" in
Switzerland until 1907. Trotsky was brought to the U.S., where he lived
rent free on the Standard Oil property at Bayonne,New Jersey, its tank
field. When the Czar abdicated, Trotsky was placed on a ship with three
hundred Communist revolutionaries from the Lower East Side of <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>.
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> obtained a special passport for Trotsky from Woodrow Wilson
and sent Lincoln Steffens with him to make sure he was returned safely to
Russia. For traveling expenses, <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> placed a purse containing
$10000 in Trotsky's pocket. </p>
      <p> On April 131917, when the ship stopped in Halifax, Canadian Secret
Service officers immediately arrested Trotsky and interred him in Nova
Scotia. The case became an international cause celebre, as leading
government officials from several nations frantically demanded Trotsky's
release. The Secret Service had been tipped off that Trotsky was on his
way to take Russia out of the war, freeing more German armies to attack
Canadian troups on the Western Front. </p>
      <p> Prime Minister Lloyd George hurriedly cabled orders from London to the
Canadian Secret Service to free Trotsky at once - they ignored him.
Trotsky was finally freed by the intervention of one of <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s
most faithful stooges, Canadian Minister Mackenzie King, who had long
been a "labor specialist" for the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s. King personally obtained
Trotsky's release and sent him on his way as the emissary of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s, commissioned to win the Bolshevik Revolution. Thus, Dr.
Armand Hammer, who loudly proclaimed his influence in Russia as the
friend of Lenin, has an insignificant claim compared to the role of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s in backing world Communism. </p>
      <p> Although Communism, like other "isms", had origined with Marx's
association with the House of Rothschild, it enlisted the reverent
support of John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> because he saw Communism for what it is,
the ultimate monopoly, not only controlling the government, the monetary
system and all property, but also a monopoly which, like the corporations
it emulates, is self-perpetuating and eternal. It was the logical
progression from his Standard Oil monopoly. </p>
      <p> An important step on the road to world monopoly was the most far-reaching
corporation invented by the Rothschilds. This was the international drug
and chemical cartel, I. G. Farben. Called "a state within a state" , it
was created in 1925 as Interessen Gemeinschaft Farbeinindustrie Aktien
Gesellschaft, usually known simply as I. G. Farben, which simply meant
"The Cartel". It had originated in 1904, when the six major chemical
companies in Germany began negotiations to form the ultimate cartel,
merging Badische Anilin,Bayer,Agfa,Hoechst,Weiler-ter-Meer, and
Greisheim-Electron. The guiding spirit,as well as the financing, came
from the Rothschilds, who were represented by their German banker, Max
Warburg of M. M. Warburg Company, Hamburg. He later headed the German
Secret Service during World War I and was personal financial advisor to
the Kaiser. </p>
      <p> When the Kaiser was overthrown, after losing the war, Max Warburg was not
exiled with him to Holland; instead he became the financial advisor to
the new government. </p>
      <p> Monarchs may come and go, but the real power remains with the bankers.
While representing Germany at the Paris Peace Conference, Max Warburg
spent pleasant hours renewing family ties with his brother, Paul Warburg,
who, after drafting the Federal Reserve Act at Jekyll Island, had headed
the U.S. banking system during the war. He was in Paris as Woodrow
Wilson's financial advisor. </p>
      <p> I. G. Farben soon had a net worth of six billion marks, controlling some
five hundred firms. Its first president was Professor Carl Bosch. During
the period of the Weimar Republic, I.G. Farben officials,seeing the
handwriting, began a close association with one called Adolf Hitler,
supplying much needed funds and political influence. </p>
      <p> The success of the I.G. Farben cartel had aroused the interest of other
industrialists. Henry Ford was favorably impressed and set up a German
branch of Ford Motor Company. Forty percent of the stock was purchased by
I.G. Farben. I.G. Farben then established an American subsidiary called
American I.G., in cooperation with Standard Oil of New Jersey. Its
directors included Walter Teagle, President of Standard Oil, Paul Warburg
of Kuhn,Loeb Company and Edsel Ford, representing the Ford interests.
John Foster Dulles, for the law firm, Sullivan and Cromwell, became the
attorney for I.G., frequently traveling between <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> and Berlin on
cartel business. His law partner, Arthur Dean, is now director of the
$40 million Teagle Foundation which was set up before Teagle's death.
Like other fortunes, it had become part of the network. </p>

      <p>This text is being posted with the intent to EDUCATE those of you who
know not the silent and pervasive influence of your hidden masters. Some
have looked for shadows of the old illuminati; they look amiss, not seeing
that which is all around them. If you know not the "who" and the "why",
efforts will be mis-directed. This is NOT a "conspiracy"..nay, it is a
very cold and calculated NETWORK of individuals whose intent is nothing
short of implementation of a "New World Order"; an oligarchic rein in which
*you* serve as little more that slaves in their "technocracy". This network
has every intention to implement a cashless society, for it is they who
control every aspect of finance and banking over the entire globe. They
have had about 100 years to perfect their plans and put them into practice.

Please understand that the Bilderbergers, the Council on Foreign Relations,
the Tri-lateral Commission,the Institute for Policy Studies, the <ent type='ORG'>Roundtables</ent>,
the "Club of Rome",etc are ALL bound by common denominators of long-standing
families ties, and interests and come together as a _single_ policy making
body that is known today as "The Committee of 300" . This has also been
known as "The Olympians", the "Policy Committee".

Don't be mis-led by labels such as "<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>" or "Rothschild"; for these
are simply the families who have the mechanisms of control already set in
place,but of themselves are not the entire network; that being the
"Committee of 300". It is THEY who control the UN, who tell the heads of
nations "when to jump and how high", they who are behind the world's illicit
drug trade via the CIA and the old <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> East India links. They who
manage the IMF,set policy at GATT conferences. It is they who ARE the
"Shadow Government". It is they who manage the CIA,NSA,DIA..the same
group that took out JFK and have MURDERED around 173 people in their efforts
to suppress the truth about all the links..they who were behind the
assassination of <ent type='PERSON'>RFK</ent>,<ent type='PERSON'>MLK</ent>..they who are behind the suppression of truth
regarding the MIA's; It is the same group behind E. Howard Hunt,
John Singlaub, Ollie <ent type='LOC'>North</ent>..the very same group who brought down Richard
Nixon in Watergate..the same group behind the persecution of the Christic
Institute..the same people who were behind Nugan-Hand..the same group
that groomed Jimmy Carter for the Presidency..the same group who ARE
the "Military-Industrial complex", the same group behind the total
militarization of NASA..the same group who ARE "MJ-12", were behind the
"Jason Group"..the same behind Project Blue Book, The Condon Committee,
the same who started up the NSA..who are responsible for the MURDER of
Danny Casalaro..the same group responsible for the world-wide DISINFO
campaign regarding the TRUTH of <ent type='EVENT'>UFO</ent> sightings and contacts. The very
SAME group who OWN THE MEDIA..ie..The Washington Post, NBC (General
Electric),<ent type='ORG'>ABC</ent>,<ent type='ORG'>CBS</ent>,The <ent type='ORG'>New York Times</ent>,etc. The same group behind the
the Warren Commission,ad nauseum..

I DO believe I could make a DIRECT connection here with just what
CIABASE says on <ent type='ORG'>WACKENHUT</ent> that also ties in the Shadow Government
with <ent type='EVENT'>UFO</ent> related installations; this is but *ONE* connection..there
are many,many more that can be and will be ferreted out for exposure.</p>

      <p>The word out of the Bilderberg annual meeting is that there will be another
war within the next five years.</p>
      <p>It was repeatedly stated at the Bilderberg meeting that there will be
"other Saddams" in the years ahead who must be dealt with swiftly and
efficiently.</p>
      <p>The Bilderberg group plans a global army at the disposal of the United
Nations. It is their hope that the U.N. will become the world government
by the year 2000.</p>
      <p>"A U.N. army must be able to act immediately, anywhere in the world, without
delays involved in each country making its own decision whether to
participate, based on parochial considerations," said Henry Kissinger.</p>
      <p>If Americans can be persuaded to surrender warmaking decisions to the U.N.,
"parochial nationalism" in <ent type='GPE'>Briton</ent>, France and elsewhere will disappear,
Bilderberg speakers said.</p>
      <p>"The Persian Gulf venture has advanced the cause by years" one speaker said.</p>

      <p>The following is on the historical perspective of just the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
and Rothschild connections and in no way attempts to cover every
aspect, but will suffice to give you a basis on which to understand
how pervasive the Web of influence is and that it is a good deal MORE
than "merely a conspiracy". Just WHO makes up the ILLEGAL SHADOW
GOVERMNENT,YOUR HIDDEN MASTERS?</p>
      <p>I ask no one to accept any of this at face value, and would heartily
encourage you to perform your own investigation. To that end,I've
provided an extensive list of reading materials at the end of this
text.

And lastly, I would include a very lucid assessment of our situation
by John DiNardo, which in my opinion, is absolutely correct. There have
been MANY people who are posting such as John, Dave Radcliffe, Rich
Winkel and others who have been showing you just *WHO* the CANCER IS.</p>
      <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the usurpers of our freedom, the plunderers of our life's earnings,
the despoilers of our planet Earth, the deluders of our TV-zombified
society, the desecrators of our Constitution can crush the Christic
Institute -- than what refuge is left for the few remaining
Christic-like organizations to shelter THEM from this Frankenstein
Monster government? What refuge is left for you and me, and for our
children who will necessarily find themselves forced to riot and
spill their blood in the streets during the twenty-first century?
It always degenerates to that, you know.</p>
      <p> We Americans are a lazy, short-sighted bunch. We realize that if we
don't earn a living, we will be impoverished. We realize that if we
don't brush our teeth, our teeth will rot out of our mouths. We
realize that if we don't service our cars, they will fail to operate.
Yet, we don't realize -- or we're too lazy to admit -- that if we
don't supervise and participate in our system of government to ensure
that our Constitution is protected from the greedy, power-mad
neurotics whose ambitions drive them to seize the reins of power
and wealth vested in our Federal Government, then our libertarian
foundations will crumble beneath us, leaving us to fall into the
pit of subjugation that the corporate rulers have prepared for us.</p>
      <p> As we witness our free-fall into the pit, we finally understand
that the law is slipping out of our hands; that we and our children
will have to resort to meeting in dark rooms and plotting to recover
our Constitutional freedoms which the usurpers have seized through
television, that great national Svengali -- that opiate of the masses
which they have so cleverly employed to sedate, delude and distract us
while quietly cuffing our ankles and wrists. How could we be so stupid
as to surrender our minds to Big Brother, never suspecting that
whenever someone offers you free entertainment, day after day and
year after year, it's got to be costing you. </p>
      <p> Why shouldn't we be as vulnerable to totalitarianism as are
the peoples of most other societies around the world. More so,
considering the fact that totalitarianism originates from within the
military elite. And whose nation has the most savagely powerful
military force on the planet? What's worse is that it's not just the
military that's militating against our Constitutional freedoms.
It's the military-industrial complex. President Eisenhower left office
a third of a century ago by warning us that the military-industrial
complex is the greatest threat to our freedom. That was as much of
a warning as he dared give, lest he meet the doom of his valiant
successor who tried to actually BE the President of the United States.</p>
      <p> How knowledgeable was the General of the Army of the Second World War,
Dwight Eisenhower, in his fear of the military-industrial complex?
As knowledgeable as President Kennedy is dead!</p>
      <p> So you see, there really isn't much time left. If we prove to be too
lazy now to unite behind Constitutional upholders such as the
Christic Institute -- then our children in the twenty-first century
will NOT be too frightened to stand up against the bullets of the
<ent type='ORG'>Wackenhut</ent> Security Corporation of Coral Gables, Florida. Because
when the oppression becomes intolerable, you, I and anyone would
stand up to bullets, rather than go on living in unbearable agony.
Ask the Palestinian people who stand up to bullets every day --
or the Rumanian people, or the Guatemalan people, or the Filipino
people, or the Chinese people, or the Iranian people, or the
Tibetan people, or the Timorese people.</p>
      <p> If we prove to be too lazy now, OUR generation may even see the day
when citizens will speak softly and listen intently for the footsteps
of the Gestapo who may finally come to kick down our front door and
arrest us for plotting to regain the Constitutional freedoms
that were once our heritage.</p>
      <p> John DiNardo</p>
      <p> Excerpted from the book, "Rape of The Constitution; Death of Freedom" by
Gyeorgos C. Hatonn . </p>
      <p> *** The <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate ***</p>
      <p> Many American conservatives believe as a matter of faith that the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s and the Council on Foreign Relations exercise absolute
control over the government and the people of the U.S. This thesis can
be accepted as a working formula if one remains conscious of the larger
issues. Two writers for whom the present writer (E.M) has great respect,
Dr. Emanuel Josephson and Morris Bealle, insisted on focusing on the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s and excluding all other aspects of the World Order. This
severely limited the effect of their otherwise groundbreaking work on the
Medical Monopoly. This writer advanced a contrary view in "The World
Order," fixing upon the Rothschild monetary power, which reached a point
of world control by 1885, and its London policy group, the Royal
Institute of International Affairs, as the policy makers for what has
essentially been, since 1900, a re-established colonial government,
functions primarily through the Council on Foreign Relations, but only as
the subsidiary of RIIA and through the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation, which
controls government functions, the educational establishments, the media,
the religions and the state legislatures. </p>
      <p> It is true that the American colonials have "free elections," in which
they have the absolute right to vote for one of two opposing candidates,
both of whom have been handpicked and financed by the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
syndicate. This touching evidence of "democracy" serves to convince most
Americans that you are indeed a free people. You even have a cracked
Liberty Bell in Philadelphia to prove it. American youths have been free
since 1900 to be marched off to die in Hegelian wars in which both
combatants received their instructions from the World Order. You are free
to invest in a stock market in which the daily quantity,price and value
of the monetary unit is manipulated and controlled by a Federal Reserve
System which is answerable only to the Bank of England. It has maintained
its vaunted "independence" from your government control, but this is the
only independence it has ever had. </p>
      <p> The realization that you do indeed live under the dictates of the
"<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate" can well be the starting point of the long road
back of a genuine struggle for American independence. In exposing "the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s" as agents of a foreign power, which is not merely a foreign
power, but a genuine world government, you must realize that this is not
merely a group dedicated to making money, but a group which is committed
to maintaining the power of a colonial form of government over the
American people. Thus the ancient calumny of John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> as a
man obsessed by greed (a category in which he has plenty of company)
obscures the fact that from the day the Rothschilds began to finance his
march towards a total oil monopoly in the United States from their
coffers at the National City Bank of Cleveland, <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> was never an
independent power, nor does any department of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate
operate as an independent power. You know that the Cosa Nostra, or
Mafia, with which the Syndicate is closely allied, has somewhat
autonomous power in the regions which have been assigned to that
particular "family" by the national directors, but this always implies
that that family remains under total control and answerable for
everything which occurs in its territory. </p>
      <p> Similarly, the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate operates under clearly defined
spheres of influence. The "charitable" organizations, the business
companies and the policy groups, always meld into a working operation,
nor can any department of the Syndicate strike out on its own or
formulate an independent policy, no matter what may be its
justification. </p>
      <p> The <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate operates under the control of the world
financial structure, which means that on any given day, all of its assets
could be rendered close to worthless by adroit financial manipulation.
This is the final control, which ensures that no one can quit the
organization. Not only would he be stripped of all assets, but he would
be under contract for immediate assassination. The Department of Justice
is well aware that the only "terrorists" operating in the United States
are the agents of the World Order, but they prudently avoid any mention
of this fact. </p>
      <p> The world financial structure, far from being an unknown or hidden
organization, is actually well known and well defined. It consists of
the major Swiss Banks; the survivors of the old Venetian-Genoese banking
axis; the Big Five of the world grain trade; the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> combine,
centered in the Bank of England and its chartered merchant banks,
functioning through the Rothschilds and the Oppenheimers and having
absolute control over their Canadian colony through the Royal Bank of
<ent type='GPE'>Canada</ent> and the Bank of <ent type='GPE'>Montreal</ent>, their Canadian lieutenants being the
Bronfmans, Belzbergs, Reichmanns and other financial operators; and the
colonial banking structure in the U.S., controlled by the Bank of England
through the Federal Reserve System; the Boston Brahmin families who made
their fortunes in the opium trade, including the Delanos and others and
the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank, American Express, the present
form of the old Rothschild representatives in the U.S., which includes
Kuhn,Loeb Company and Lehman Brothers. </p>
      <p> It is notable that the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate is far down on the list of
the worlds financial structure. Why then is it of such importance?
Although it is not the crucial factor in financial decision in the
Western Hemisphere, it is the actual working control mechanism of the
American colony. The <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> family themselves,like the
Morgans,Schiffs and Warburgs, have faded into insignificance, but the
mechanism created in their name roars along at full power,still
maintaining all of the functions for which it was organized. Since he
set up the Trilateral Commission, David <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> has functioned as a
sort of international courier for the World Order, principally concerned
with delivering working instructions to the Communist bloc,either
directly, in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> or by traveling to the area. Laurence <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
is active in the operation of the Medical Monopoly, but his principal
interests are in operating various vacation spas in tropical areas. They
are the two survivors of the "Fortunate Five," the five sons of John D.
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, Jr. and Abby Aldrich. John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, Jr. died in an
institution in Tucson,Arizona and was hastily cremated. John D.
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> III died in a mysterious accident on a <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> Parkway near
his home. Nelson <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, named after his grandfather, died in the
arms of a TV journalist. It was later revealed that he had also been in
the arms of another TV journalist at the same time; the death was hushed
up for many hours. It was generally believed that he ran afoul of his
<ent type='GPE'>Columbian</ent> drug connection, the disagreement hardly being trivial; it
involved several billion dollars in drug profits which had not been
properly apportioned. Winthrop <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> died an alcoholic in the arms
of his black boy friend. He had been interviewed on television by Harry
Reasoner to explain his hasty move from <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> to Arkansas. Winthrop
learned that his black boy friend, an Army sergeant who apparently taught
him the mysteries of drill,refused to live in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>. To celebrate this
alliance, Winthrop <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> gave magnificiently to Negro
causes,including the Urban League building on East 48th Street in New
York. A plaque on the second floor notes that it was his gift; it might
well have stated "From Hadrian to his Antinous." </p>
      <p> We do not wish to imply that the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s no longer have influence,
but that the major policy dictates of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate are
handed down by other caps, of whom they continue to be a visible force.
Through the person of David <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, the family is sometimes called
"the first family of the Soviet Union." Only he and Dr. Armand Hammer,
the moving force behind USTEC, have permanent permission to land their
private planes at the Moscow Airport. Others would suffer the fate of KAL
007. David <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s most significant trip to the Soviet Union may
have been the fateful day when he landed in Moscow, having been told to
inform Khrushchev that he was "through". The <ent type='NORP'>Russians</ent> are very health
conscious, and a scientist had sent information to Khrushchev that the
use of chemical fertilizers in the Soviet Union presented a threat to the
people. Khrushchev then announced a major change in the Soviet farm
policy, centering around a reduction in the use of chemicals. This was
upsetting to the head of the world's Chemical Fertilizer trust, David
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, and he responded with a terse one word command, "Out". </p>
      <p> Both the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> family fortune and the considerable portion set
aside in the foundations of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Syndicate are effectively
insulated against any type of government control. FORTUNE magazine noted
August ,1986, that John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>,Jr. had created trusts in 1934
which now amounted to some $2.3 billion; another 200 million had been set
aside for the Abby <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> branch. The five sons had trusts which in
1986 amounted to $2.1 billion. These trusts had originally amounted to
only $50 million each,showing the increase in their assets as well as
inflation during the ensuing half century. FORTUNE estimated the 1986
total <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> wealth as $3.5 billion of which $900 million was in
securities and real estate. They owned 45% of the Time Life
Building; Nelson <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s International Basic Economy Corporation had
been sold to a <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> company in 1980. For years, the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> family
had deliberately kept the rents low in its major holding, <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
Center, a $1.6 billion investment yielding an annual return of 1% . This
was a convenient manuever for tax purposes, and a good one at that. </p>
      <p> Much of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> wealth might be attributed to old John D.'s
rapacity and ruthlessness; its origins are indubitably based in his
initial financing from the National City Bank of Cleveland, which was
identified in Congressional reports as one of the three Rothschild banks
in the United States and by his later acceptance of the guidance of Jacob
Schiff of Kuhn,Loeb Company, who had been born in the Rothschild house in
Franfort and was now the principal Rothschild representive (but unknown
as such to the public) in the United States. </p>
      <p> With the seed money from the National City Bank in Cleveland, old John D.
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> soon laid claim to the title of the "most ruthless American".
It is more than likely that it was this quality which persuaded the
Rothschilds to back him. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> realized early in the game that the
oil refinery business, which could offer great profits in a short time,
also was at the mercy of uncontrolled competition. His solution was a
simple one--crush all competition. The famous <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> dedication to
total monopoly was simply a business decision. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> embarked on a
campaign of coercing all competing oil refineries out of business. He
attacked on a number of fronts, which is also a lesson to all would be
entrepreneurs. First, he would send a minion, not known to be working for
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, with an offer to buy the competing refinery for a low
price,but offering cash. If the offer was refused, the competitor would
then come under attack from a competing refinery which greatly undercut
his price. He might also suffer a sudden strike at his refinery,which
would force him to shut down. Control of labor through unions has always
been a basic <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> technique. Like the Soviet Union, they seldom
have labor trouble. If these techniques failed, <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> would then
be saddened by a reluctant decision to use violence; beating the rival
workers as they went to and from their jobs, or burning or blowing up the
competing refinery. </p>
      <p> These techniques convinced the Rothschilds that they had found their
man.They sent their personal representative,Jacob Schiff, to Cleveland to
help <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> plan further expansion. At this time,the Rothschilds
controlled 95% of all railroad mileage in the United States,through the
J.P. Morgan Company and Kuhn Loeb Company,according to official
Department of Commerce figures for the year 1895. J.P. Morgan mentions in
his "Who's Who" listing that he controlled 50000 miles of U.S.
railways. Schiff worked out an elaborate rebate deal for
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>,through a dummy corporation,South Improvement Company. These
rebates ensured that no other oil company could survive in competition
with the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> firm. The scheme was later exposed,but by that time
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had achieved a virtual monopoly of the oil business in the
U.S. The daughter of one of his victims, Ida Tarbell,whose father was
ruined by <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s criminal operations, wrote the first major expose
of the Standard Oil Trust. She was promptly denounced as a "muckracker"
by the poseur, Theodore Roosevelt, who claimed to be a "trustbuster." In
fact, he ensured the dominance of the Standard Oil Trust and other giant
trusts. </p>
      <p> During the next half century, John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> was routinely
caricatured by socialist propagandists as the epitome of the ruthless
capitalist. At the same time, he was the principal financier of the
world Communist movement, through a firm called American International
Company. Despite the fact that the House of Rothschild had already
achieved world control,the sound and the fury was directed exclusively
against its two principal representatives,John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> and J.P.
Morgan. One of the few revelations of the actual state of affairs
appeared in TRUTH magazine,Dec 161912, which pointed out that "Mr.
Schiff is head of the great private banking house of Kuhn, Loeb Company
(I knew some of you bright readers would finally pick up that these names
are all attached to the greatest pharmaceutical firms in the world--even
into your very vitamin supplement business!), which represents the
Rothschild interests on your side of the Atlantic. He is described as a
financial strategist and has been for years the financial minister of the
great impersonal power known as Standard Oil." Note that the name of
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> was not mentioned in the quote. </p>
      <p> Because of these concealed factors,it was a relatively simple matter for
the American public to accept the "fact" that the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s were the
preeminent power in your country. This myth was actually clothed in the
apparel of power,the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Oil Trust becoming the
"military-industrial complex" which assumed political control of the
nation; the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Medical Monopoly attained control of the health
care of the nation, and the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation, a web of affiliated
tax emempt creations, effectively controlled the religious and
educational life of the nation. The myth succeeded in its goal of
camouflaging the hidden rulers, the Rothschilds. </p>
      <p> After Eustis Mullins and a few others, had been exposing this charade for
some twenty-five years a new myth began to be noised about in American
conservative circles, effectively propagated by active double agents.
This myth found a host of eager believers,because it heralded a growing
crack in the monolithic power which had been oppressing all the peoples
of the world. This "new" revelation was that a struggle to the death for
world power had developed between the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s and the Rothschilds.
According to this startling development, one faction or the other,
depending on which agent you were listening to, had gained control of the
Soviet Union and would use its power as the basis for achieving the
overthrow of the other faction. The sudden death of several members of
the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> family was cited as "proof" that such a struggle was
taking place, although no Rothschild is known to have succumbed during
this "war." This ignored the general understanding that Nelson
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had been "eliminated" as the result of losing deposit slips
for several billion dollars of drugs from the <ent type='GPE'>Columbian</ent> cartel, or that
the other <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> deaths showed no trace of a "Rothschild
connection." </p>
      <p> Having maintained extensive files on this situation for several decades,
the writer (E.M.),could not believe anyone could be so misinformed as to
think that "the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s" were now trying to seize power from the
Rothschilds, at a time when the influence of members of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
family was already in great decline, their family finances being handled
by John J. McCloy, and other faithful retainers;none of the retainers
would have been willing to engage in a genuine power struggle, as they
were faceless managers who lived only for their weekly paycheck. They
had no ambitions of their own. Nevertheless, many hopeful Americans
grasped at the will-o-the-wisp notion the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s were now "good
Americans" who were willing to risk all to overthrow the Rothschilds.
Amazingly enough, this pernicious story persisted for almost a decade
before being relegated to the curiosities of history. </p>
      <p> Like J.P. Morgan, who had begun his commercial career by selling the U.S.
Army some defective guns, the famous Hall carbine affair, John D.
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> also was a war profiteer during the Civil War;he sold
unstamped Harkness liquor to Federal troops at a high profit, gaining the
initial capital to embark on his drive for monopoly. His interest in the
oil business was a natural one; his father,William <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had been
"in oil" for years. William <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had become an oil entrepreneur
after salt wells at Tarentum, near Pittsburgh, were discovered in 1842 to
be flowing with oil. The owners of the wells,Samuel L. Kier, began to
bottle the oil and sell it for medicinal purposes. One of his earliest
wholesalers was William <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>. The "medicine" was originally
labelled "Kier's Magic Oil". <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> printed his own labels, using
"Rock Oil" or "Seneca Oil", Seneca being the name of a well known <ent type='NORP'>Indian</ent>
Tribe. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> achieved his greatest notoriety and his greatest
profits by advertising himself as "William <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, the Celebrated
Cancer Specialist". It is understandable that his grandsons would become
the controlling power behind the scenes of the world's most famous cancer
treatment center and would direct government funds and charitable
contributions to those areas which only benefit the Medical Monopoly.
William <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> spared no claim in his flamboyant career. He
guaranteed "All Cases of Cancer Cured Unless They Are Too Far Gone". Such
were the healing powers that he attributed to his magic cancer cure that
he was able to retail it for $25 a bottle, a sum then equivalent to two
month's wages. The "cure" consisted of a few well known diuretics, which
had been diluted by water. This carnival medicine show barker could
hardly have envisioned that his descendants would control the greatest
and the most profitable Medical Monopoly in recorded history. </p>
      <p> As an itinerant "carnie", a traveling carnival peddler, William
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had chosen a career which interfered with developing a stable
family life. His son, John, rarely saw him, a circumstance which has
inspired some psychological analysts to conjecture that the absence of a
father figure or parental love may have contributed to John D.
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s subsequent development as a money mad tyrant who plotted to
maim, poison and kill millions of his fellow Americans during almost a
century of his monopolistic operations and whose influence, reaching up
from the grave, remains the most dire and malignant presence in American
life. This may have been a contributing factor--however, it is also
possible that he was totally evil. It is hardly arguable that he is
probably one of the most Satanic figures in American history. Evil being
defined as anything that moves the spiritual aspect of beingness away
from God as influenced through another. </p>
      <p> It has long been a truism that you can find a horse thief or two in any
prominent American family. In the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> family, it was more than
true in the case of William who seemed to have faithfully followed the
precepts of the Will of Canaan throughout his career, "love robbery, love
lechery". He fled from a number of indictments for horse stealing and
you know how serious that is, finally disappearing altogether as William
and <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> and magically re-emerging as a Dr. William Levingston of
Philadelphia, a name which he retained for the rest of his life. An
investigative reporter at Joseph Pulitzer's <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> World received a tip
that was followed up. The World then disclosed that William Avery
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had died May 11, 1906 in Freeport, Illinois, where he was
interred in an unmarked grave as Dr. William Levingston. </p>
      <p> William <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s vocation as a medicine man greatly facilitated his
preferred profession of horse thief. As one who planned to be in the
next county by morning, it was a simple matter to tie a handsome stallion
to the back of his wagon and head for the open road. It also played a
large part in his vocation as a woman-chaser; he was described as being
"woman-mad". </p>
      <p> On June 281849, he was indicted for raping a hired girl in Cayuga,New
York; he later was found to be residing in Oswego, <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> and was
forced once again to decamp for parts unknown. He had no difficulty in
financing his woman-chasing interests from the sale of his miraculous
cancer cure and from another product, his "Wonder Working Liniment",
which he offered at only two dollars a bottle. It consisted of crude
petroleum from which the lighter oils had been boiled away, leaving a
heavy solution of paraffin,lube oil and tar, which comprised the
"liniment". William <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s original miracle oil survived until
quite recently as a concoction called Nujol, consisting principally of
petroleum and peddled as a laxative. It was well known that Nujol was
merely an advertising sobriquet meaning "new oil", as opposed apparently,
to "old oil". Sold as an antidote to constipation, it robbed the body of
fat-soluble vitamins, it being a well-established medical fact that
mineral oil coated the intestine and prevented the absorption of many
needed vitamins and other nutritional needs. Its makers added carotine
as a sop to the health-conscious, but it was hardly worth the bother.
Nujol was manufactured by a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey,
called Stanco, whose only other product, manufactured on the same
premises, was the famous insecticide, Flit. </p>
      <p> Nujol was hawked from the Senate Office Building in Washington for years
during a more liberal interpretation of "conflict of interest". In this
case, it was hardly a conflict of interest, because the august
peddler,Senator Royal S. Copeland, never had any interests other than
serving the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s. He was a physician whom <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had
appointed as head of the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> State Department of Health and later
financed his campaign for the Senate. Copeland's frank display of
commercialism amazed even the most blase' Washington reporters. </p>
      <p> He devoted his Senate career to a daily program advertising Nujol. A
microphone was set up in his Senate office each morning, the first order
of business being the Nujol program, for which he was paid $75000 a
year, an enormous salary in the 1930's and more than the salary of the
President of the United States. Senator Copeland's exploits earned him a
number of nicknames on Capital Hill. He was often called the Senator from
the American Medical Association, because of his enthusiastic backing for
any program launched by the AMA and Morris Fishbein. More realistically,
he was usually referred to as "the Senator from Standard Oil". He could
be counted on to promote any legislation devised for the greater profit
of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> monopoly. During congressional debate on the Food and
Drug Act in 1938, he came under criticism from Congresswoman Leonor
Sullivan, who charged that Senator Copeland, a physician who handled the
bill on the Senate floor, frankly acknowledged during the debate that
soap was exempted from the law because the soap manufacturers, who were
the nation's largest advertisers, would otherwise join with other big
industries to fight the bill. Congresswoman Sullivan complained that,
"Soap was officially declared in the law not to be a cosmetic. The hair
dye manufacturers were given a license to market known dangerous
products, just so long as they placed a special warning on the label -
but what woman in a beauty parlor ever sees the label on the bulk
container in which hair dye is shipped?" </p>
      <p> Just as the elder <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had spent his life in the pursuit of his
personal obsession, women, so his son John was equally obsessed, being
money-mad instead of woman-mad, totally committed to the pursuit of
ever-increasing wealth and power. However, the principal accomplishments
of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> drive for power, the rebate scheme for monopoly, the
chartering of the foundations to gain power over American citizens,the
creation of the central bank, the Federal Reserve System, the backing of
the World Communist Revolution and the creation of the Medical Monoply,
all came from the Rothschilds or from their European employees. </p>
      <p> We cannot find in the records of John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> that he originated
any of these programs. The concept of the tax exempt charitable
foundation originated with the Rothschild minion, George Peabody, in
1865. The Peabody Educational Foundation later became the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
Foundation and many of you should recall that item. Not that you might
have been around then but it continues to inadvertently be referred to as
such. </p>
      <p> It is unlikely that even the diabolical mind of John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> could
have conceived of this devious twist. A social historian has described
the major development of the late nineteenth century, when charitable
foundations and world Communism became important movements, as one of the
more interesting facets of history, perhaps equivalent to the discovery
of the wheel or fire. This new discovery was the concept developed by
the rats, who after all have rather highly developed intelligences, that
they could trap people by baiting traps with little bits of cheese. The
history of mankind since then has been the rats catching humans in their
traps. Socialism -- indeed, any government program -- is simply the rat
baiting the trap with a smidgeon of cheese and catching himself a human. </p>
      <p> Congressman Wright Patman, chairman of the House Banking and Currency
Committee, noted from the floor of Congress that the establishment of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation effectively insulated Standard Oil from
competition. The controlling stock had been removed from market
manipulation or possible buyouts by competitors. It also relieved
Standard Oil from most taxation, which then placed a tremendous added
burden on individual American taxpayers. Although a <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> relative
by marriage, Senator Nelson Aldrich, Republican majority leader in the
Senate, had pushed the General Education Board charter through Congress,
the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation charter proved to be more difficult.
Widespread criticism of <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s monopolistic practices was heard,
and his effort to insulate his profits from taxation or takeover was seen
for what it was. The charter was finally pushed through in 1913 (the
significant <ent type='NORP'>Masonic</ent> numeral 13 -- 1913 was also the year of the
progressive income tax and of the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act).
Senator Robert F. Wagner of <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>, another Senator from Standard Oil
(there were quite a few), ramrodded the Congressional approval of the
charter. The charter was then signed by John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, John D.
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, Jr., Henry Pratt Judson, president of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
established University of Chicago,Simon Flexner, director of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Institute, Starr Jameson, described in "Who's Who" as
"personal counsel to John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> in his benevolences", and
Charles W. Eliot, president of Harvard University. </p>
      <p> The <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Oil Monopoly is now 127 years old, yet in 1911, the
Supreme Court, bowing to public outrage, had ruled that it had to be
broken up. The resulting companies proved to be no problem for the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> interests. The family retained a two per cent holding in
each of the "new" companies, while the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> foundations took a
three per cent holding in each company. This gave them a five per cent
stock interest in each company; a one per cent holding in a corporation
is usually sufficient to maintain working control. </p>
      <p> The involvement of the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s in promoting the World Communist
Revolution also developed from their business interests. There was never
any commitment to the Marxist ideology; like anything else, it was there
to be used. At the turn of the century, Standard Oil was competing
fiercely with Royal Dutch Shell for control of the lucrative European
market. Congressional testimony revealed that <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> had sent large
sums of money to Lenin and Trotsky to instigate the Communist Revolution
in 1905. His banker, Jacob Schiff had previously financed the <ent type='NORP'>Japanese</ent> in
their war against Russia and had sent a personal emissary, George Kennan
to Russia to spend some twenty years in promoting revolutionary activity
against the Czar. </p>
      <p> When the 1905 revolution failed, Lenin was placed "in storage" in
Switzerland until 1907. Trotsky was brought to the U.S., where he lived
rent free on the Standard Oil property at Bayonne,New Jersey, its tank
field. When the Czar abdicated, Trotsky was placed on a ship with three
hundred Communist revolutionaries from the Lower East Side of <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>.
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> obtained a special passport for Trotsky from Woodrow Wilson
and sent Lincoln Steffens with him to make sure he was returned safely to
Russia. For traveling expenses, <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> placed a purse containing
$10000 in Trotsky's pocket. </p>
      <p> On April 131917, when the ship stopped in Halifax, Canadian Secret
Service officers immediately arrested Trotsky and interred him in Nova
Scotia. The case became an international cause celebre, as leading
government officials from several nations frantically demanded Trotsky's
release. The Secret Service had been tipped off that Trotsky was on his
way to take Russia out of the war, freeing more German armies to attack
Canadian troups on the Western Front. </p>
      <p> Prime Minister Lloyd George hurriedly cabled orders from London to the
Canadian Secret Service to free Trotsky at once - they ignored him.
Trotsky was finally freed by the intervention of one of <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>'s
most faithful stooges, Canadian Minister Mackenzie King, who had long
been a "labor specialist" for the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s. King personally obtained
Trotsky's release and sent him on his way as the emissary of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s, commissioned to win the Bolshevik Revolution. Thus, Dr.
Armand Hammer, who loudly proclaimed his influence in Russia as the
friend of Lenin, has an insignificant claim compared to the role of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s in backing world Communism. </p>
      <p> Although Communism, like other "isms", had origined with Marx's
association with the House of Rothschild, it enlisted the reverent
support of John D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> because he saw Communism for what it is,
the ultimate monopoly, not only controlling the government, the monetary
system and all property, but also a monopoly which, like the corporations
it emulates, is self-perpetuating and eternal. It was the logical
progression from his Standard Oil monopoly. </p>
      <p> An important step on the road to world monopoly was the most far-reaching
corporation invented by the Rothschilds. This was the international drug
and chemical cartel, I. G. Farben. Called "a state within a state" , it
was created in 1925 as Interessen Gemeinschaft Farbeinindustrie Aktien
Gesellschaft, usually known simply as I. G. Farben, which simply meant
"The Cartel". It had originated in 1904, when the six major chemical
companies in Germany began negotiations to form the ultimate cartel,
merging Badische Anilin,Bayer,Agfa,Hoechst,Weiler-ter-Meer, and
Greisheim-Electron. The guiding spirit,as well as the financing, came
from the Rothschilds, who were represented by their German banker, Max
Warburg of M. M. Warburg Company, Hamburg. He later headed the German
Secret Service during World War I and was personal financial advisor to
the Kaiser. </p>
      <p> When the Kaiser was overthrown, after losing the war, Max Warburg was not
exiled with him to Holland; instead he became the financial advisor to
the new government. </p>
      <p> Monarchs may come and go, but the real power remains with the bankers.
While representing Germany at the Paris Peace Conference, Max Warburg
spent pleasant hours renewing family ties with his brother, Paul Warburg,
who, after drafting the Federal Reserve Act at Jekyll Island, had headed
the U.S. banking system during the war. He was in Paris as Woodrow
Wilson's financial advisor. </p>
      <p> I. G. Farben soon had a net worth of six billion marks, controlling some
five hundred firms. Its first president was Professor Carl Bosch. During
the period of the Weimar Republic, I.G. Farben officials,seeing the
handwriting, began a close association with one called Adolf Hitler,
supplying much needed funds and political influence. </p>
      <p> The success of the I.G. Farben cartel had aroused the interest of other
industrialists. Henry Ford was favorably impressed and set up a German
branch of Ford Motor Company. Forty percent of the stock was purchased by
I.G. Farben. I.G. Farben then established an American subsidiary called
American I.G., in cooperation with Standard Oil of New Jersey. Its
directors included Walter Teagle, President of Standard Oil, Paul Warburg
of Kuhn,Loeb Company and Edsel Ford, representing the Ford interests.
John Foster Dulles, for the law firm, Sullivan and Cromwell, became the
attorney for I.G., frequently traveling between <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> and Berlin on
cartel business. His law partner, Arthur Dean, is now director of the
$40 million Teagle Foundation which was set up before Teagle's death.
Like other fortunes, it had become part of the network. </p>
