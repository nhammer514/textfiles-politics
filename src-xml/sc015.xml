      <p>Skolnick COMMENTARY #015
========================</p>
      <p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve
either all or portions of the following.]</p>
      <p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put
out by a group in Chicago called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>
      <p>Hi! Sherman Skolnick, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts
[CCCC], 9800 South Oglesby.</p>
      <p>&gt;From the time of <ent type='PERSON'>Clinton</ent>'s election as President on -- strange
events with <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.</p>
      <p>About the time of <ent type='PERSON'>Clinton</ent>'s November '92 election a <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>
Intelligence operative assisting <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> was murdered, together with
all his family members, in southern California. That was Ian
Stewart-Sparrow(sp?) -- having inside knowledge about the
"October Surprise" treason, the Mena, Arkansas airport dope and
gun smuggling implicating <ent type='PERSON'>Clinton</ent> as Governor, and much more.</p>
      <p>Right after <ent type='PERSON'>Clinton</ent> was inaugurated, two <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> officials were
murdered and three seriously wounded right on the road leading
into <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> headquarters -- apparently part of a fight between <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
faction one: George Bush and his gang, and faction two: Naval
Intelligence assassins.</p>
      <p>And where does <ent type='PERSON'>Clinton</ent> fit in, huh?</p>
      <p>Right before the election some 15 [persons] were arrested --
charged with shipping exotic military items without export
licenses to known terrorists. Among the defendants, Diane
Lewis(sp?), a crony of first lady Hillary of Park Ridge, a
northwest Chicago suburb. The trial was right after inauguration
day. Ms. Lewis was released after her defense attorney told the
judge, in chambers, she was with <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> *and* a pal of Hillary.</p>
      <p>Then, the strange events in Waco, Texas, right near a <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
brainwashing facility. Some believe some of the Branch Davidian
leaders knew too much. A <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and military "delta team" murdered
many while tanks with flame shooters burned down the compound. In
the assault on the building two federal agents, previously
<ent type='PERSON'>Clinton</ent>'s campaign bodyguards, were murdered -- now get this --
*by their fellow agents*.</p>
      <p>On July 17th, '93, President <ent type='PERSON'>Clinton</ent> and/or someone in the White
House acting with them (such as Vincent Foster, jr.) stopped a
genuine <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> plot to assassinate Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein.
Two days later, <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> director Sessions was "sacked," on flimsy
excuses, to block his investigation of President <ent type='PERSON'>Clinton</ent>'s
treasonous activities -- such as having military officers
assigned to <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> acting as Justice Department prosecutors pursuing
political activist civilians!</p>
      <p>The next day, White House aide Foster was found murdered in a
lower level of the White House. The Secret Service removed the
body and planted it in a national park in Virginia. The
circumstances, however, were designed by someone to put <ent type='PERSON'>Clinton</ent>
in a "catch-22" position. If <ent type='PERSON'>Clinton</ent> revealed the details, some
of it, somehow, might point to Foster's law partner and lover --
Hillary. Did she want *him* dead to save herself from prison,
huh?</p>
      <p>Some $47 million is missing from a federally insured S&amp;L in
Arkansas. Hillary and Foster were implicated in what seems to be
a bank embezzlement. Federal authorities are also investigating
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> money-laundering deals reportedly also implicating Hillary
and Foster.</p>
      <p>The Secret Service is holding clandestine meetings across the
nation about Foster, "picking the brains" of assassination
experts. The Secret Service contends three foreign intelligence
agents, disguised as known White House visitors, got into the
White House and "wiped out" Foster. {1}. The Secret Service also
claims a Foster "double" left the White House that afternoon --
all to confuse matters.</p>
      <p><ent type='PERSON'>Clinton</ent> is stonewalling release of pertinent records. Some claim
the series of mysteries somehow involve the role of Bill and
Hillary as <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> assets since an early age.</p>
      <p>And then there's the Rick Ames spy mess at <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> which <ent type='PERSON'>Clinton</ent> set
on for a year. {2}.</p>
      <p>(312) 731-1100 is our main message. Donations appreciated.

      <p>--------------------------<special> Notes </special>----------------------------
{1} According to a *Wall Street Journal* article dated March 10,
1994 ("Who is Patsy Thomasson?"), there has been lax security at
the White House, apparently due to poor overall management.
{2} Again from the *Wall Street Journal* of March 10, 1994 ("The
KGB and America's War on Drugs"), regarding the Ames spy case,
"some key questions have gone unasked." Ames reportedly was
involved with the KGB in narco-trafficking. The amount of cash
allegedly paid to Ames was "far more than in most treason-for-money cases."
