      <p>IRAQ'S MISSILES
Iraq has bought or developed an impressive array of tactical
and medium-range ballistic missiles. These include:
* Al-Abid: Tested in Dec 1989 as a satellite launcher. Would
have a range of 2000km (1250 miles) if used in a surface-to-surface mode. It is a three-stage missile weighing 48 tons. The
first stage has a cluster of five (Scud?) engines with a combined
thrust of 70 tons.
* Tammuz: Possibly another version (or use) of the Al-Abid. Has
a range of 2000km (1250 miles). Was tested in Dec 1989.
Warhead could be 500-1000 pounds.
* Condor-II: Developed jointly with Egypt and Argentina. It
would have had a range of 965km (600 miles) and carried a 1000-pound warhead, but the project was derailed by US diplomatic
More : Yes/No ?
pressure. Iraq, which viewed Condor as only one of several
programs, appears to have allowed it to drop while using much of
the German and Italian technology in the Fahd.
* Al-Husayn: A modified version of the Soviet Scud rocket. The
Iraqis took three Scuds, removed the fuel tanks from one and cut
them in half, then used the sections to lengthen the fuel tanks of
the other two Scuds (increasing fuel from 4 to 5 tons). This gave
them the 620km (400 mile) range to reach Teheran, although the
warhead was reduced to as little as 300 pounds. [When it first
appeared, the Al-Husayn raised questions about the INF treaty
(which left Soviet Scuds in Europe as legal short-range missiles).
It was thought that the range increase had been achieved by less
extensive modifications and that the Soviets could evade the
treaty with similar modifications. The US is now satisfied that the
modifications are impossible to hide.] Reports that this missile
used strap-on boosters are now known to have been only
speculation on the part of Western analysts. The Al-Husayn is
horribly inaccurate, with a CEP of (i.e. a 50% chance of landing
within) 2000m of its target. It is strongly suspected that Iraq can
now manufacture the entire Al-Husayn.
* Al-Abbas: This missile, an upgraded version of Al-Husayn built
in Iraq, has been flight tested. It has a range of 900km (560
miles), more than enough to reach Israel. The improved range

does not bring more Iranian cities within striking distance, but
does allow the missile to be launched from most of Iraq, rather
than the limited area north of Al Amarah where most Al-Husayns
were launched. The small 250-pound warhead would be little more
than a nuisance (beyond the city block it fell into) unless it was
equipped with a chemical charge. It is reportedly much more
accurate than the older Al-Husayn, with a CEP of only 300m.
* Fahd: Originally begun as Project 395, Fahd is a solid-fuel
family of missiles. One variant has a range of 250km, another of
500km+. They will eventually replace Al-Husayn.
* SS-300: A Brazilian missile with a range of only 190 miles but a
huge 2200-pound warhead, enough to do serious military
damage. Brazil has tested the engines of this missile; Iraq has
them on order.
* Scud-B: A Soviet free-flight bombardment missile with a range
of 175 miles and a 2000-pound warhead. While the Iraqis have
these, they are primarily used as a source of parts and
technology for the improved Al-Husayn.
* Frog-7: A Soviet artillery bombardment weapon with a range of
only 45 miles and a payload of 1000 pounds. Huge numbers of
an improved version (range 90km), built locally as the Laith, were
fired at Iranian forces and border towns during the war. Iraq is
developing a chemical warhead for the Laith.
More : Yes/No ?
* Ababil: A family of artillery rockets based on the Yugoslav
M87 design. There are 50km and 100km versions.
