      <p>Skolnick COMMENTARY #022
========================</p>
      <p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve
either all or portions of the following.]</p>
      <p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put
out by a group in Chicago called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>
      <p>Hi! Sherman Skolnick, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts
[CCCC], 9800 Oglesby.</p>
      <p>All the years, the <span class="ORG" title="ORG">FBI</span> and the <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> played dirty games with each
other.</p>
      <p>Example: The <span class="ORG" title="ORG">FBI</span> had leased their cars from a west suburban auto
dealer. The two so-called "owners" are much on TV... sort of, uh,
celebrities, holding up cash. Their motto? "We always save you
more money." Funny thing: The dealership was started up,
reportedly, with funds from gangster "Momo" Giancana and his gang.</p>
      <p>Often pursued by <span class="ORG" title="ORG">FBI</span> agents, "Momo" told them to "leave him
alone"; that he "worked with <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>." Some contend "Momo" helped
recruit for <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>'s aborted invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs.
"Momo" was assassinated by <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> in 1975, just as he was about to
be questioned by a Congressional committee.</p>
      <p>The auto dealer, together with their banks, reportedly acts as a
money laundry for criminal enterprises jointly with foreign and
domestic espionage units.</p>
      <p>The <span class="ORG" title="ORG">FBI</span> put together details resulting in the federal criminal
prosecution of [Frank?] Carlisi and others for loan sharking and
extortion. A key federal government witness has been Lenny
Patrick. <span class="NORP" title="NORP">Cuban</span> TV put on a documentary showing Lenny and two
other Chicago mobsters were implicated in the assassination of
President Kennedy.</p>
      <p>The Carlisi trial has been by Chicago federal district judge Paul
E. Plunkett(sp?)... implicated *himself* in covering up, in his
court, laundering of funds through the Illinois Judges Pension
Fund. A gift (or bribe) of $2 million was put offshore *for*
Judge Plunkett when he dismissed charges against 20 name-brand
stockbrokers accused of embezzling $200 million from the Judges
Pension Fund.</p>
      <p>In the Carlisi case, defense attorneys have included former
Chicago federal district judge George Layton(sp?). According to
documents from the National Archives, Layton was the secret
attorney for Lee Harvey Oswald, the Dallas <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> "patsy."</p>
      <p>Also in the Carlisi case, <span class="ORG" title="ORG">FBI</span> monitored the defendants through
the <span class="ORG" title="ORG">FBI</span> wiretap center in Presidential Towers. The two top
honchos in that residential complex have been Congressman Dan
Rostenkowski and super money wizard Dan Shannon. The two operate
their dirty game through their ownership of the spy and gangster
Garfield Ridge Trust &amp; Savings Bank. Rostenkowski also helps <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>
and foreign espionage agencies launder loot through the Chicago
Board of Trade. Two of "Rosty's" daughters were supposedly
employees of the Board of Trade -- although apparently not
performing much work.</p>
      <p>The <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> is accused of bringing into the United States 1000 kilos
of cocaine. The <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CBS</span> TV program [CfD -- Here, I think he means *60
Minutes*], however, censored how the money flowed back *out* of
the United States through the persons and businesses we have
outlined here.</p>
      <p>Another peculiar <span class="ORG" title="ORG">FBI</span> and <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> situation involves Chicago assistant
federal prosecutor William R. Hogan, jr. He has been accused, in
federal court, of arranging perjury in the criminal prosecutions
of the El Rukn dope gang. Formerly called Blackstone Rangers, the
El Rukns, as a terrorist group, have been financed by the Charles
Kettering Foundation and the Charles Merrill Trust -- *both*
money types for <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>.</p>
      <p>Are the dope shipments also *arranged* through <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>? The <span class="ORG" title="ORG">FBI</span>
started investigating Hogan but were temporarily *blocked* on
"national security" grounds by <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>! Now, with the aid of <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>,
these terrorists are being put out of jails and back on the
street.</p>
      <p>Call up your favorite news fakers or talk show fakers and tell
them to stop kidding us in censoring this.</p>
      <p>In Chicago, see us on cable tv, channel 21, 9 pm [cst] most
Monday evenings.</p>
      <p>Play it again: Eliminating Presidents. (312) 731-1505.</p>
      <p>New message Saturday; we change it several times a week.</p>
      <p>Donations appreciated. Citizen's Committee to Clean Up the
Courts, 9800 South Oglesby, Chicago, [Illinois] 60617. For the
latest on courts, banks, espionage agencies, political
assassinations, and the news media. On 24 hours a day.
