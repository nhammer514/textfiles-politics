      <p>Skolnick COMMENTARY #006
========================</p>
      <p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve
either all or portions of the following.]</p>
      <p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put
out by a group in Chicago called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>
      <p>Hi! Sherman Skolnik, Citizen's Committee to Clean Up the Courts,
9800 Oglesby.</p>
      <p>Cynics have their own way of explaining things. Such as? Clinton
returns from Europe amid a growing scandal called "Whitewater."
He mutters to himself, "I have to have a distraction." A few
hours later, a devastating earthquake shakes California.
Conspiracy theorists shout, "Ah-HAH! I told you so! Scientists
now have a way of triggering off earthquakes!"</p>
      <p>This may just be a fanciful way of expressing it. Maybe Mother
Nature just handed the President a change of subject at a
convenient time, on a national holiday, Dr. King's birthday.</p>
      <p>Sooner or later, Clinton may find his credibility has
disappeared. Can a lawyer-liar continue nevertheless to be the
front man, supposedly running the country, huh?! Is he going to
go along with the Whitewater mess because his bosses, the ultra-rich, [unclear] since he was blackmailable? Others think the
American Murder Association [A.M.A.] and the health insurance
cartel want Hillary and Bill to go.</p>
      <p>Under the 25th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Gore would
become President and there is a reported deal to make Jay
<span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Rockefeller</span> Vice President -- all by appointment, without an
election.</p>
      <p>Another possibility is to declare, *or create*, a national
emergency and invoke little-known provisions to suspend the
Constitution! If so, General Shelley Kasivilli(sp?) would step up
to the White House microphone and say, "I'm in charge here." He
has been selected to be the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Sarcastic folks expect to see him on TV standing -- now get this
-- next to a banner of the Nazi era, depicting his family's pro-Hitler background.</p>
      <p>A change in the White House most likely would cause a stock
market crash and be the basis for the so-called "national
emergency."</p>
      <p>Little known is the fact key federal judges around the country
wear two hats: as judge and as selected officers for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency [FEMA]. As FEMA operatives, they
would automatically refuse *habeus corpus* and other
constitutional rights to political activists on the National
Security Index. Computer-generated arrest warrants for such
outspoken folks are already waiting. Concentration camps have
been built in remote areas, including off-shore Alaska.</p>
      <p>The inside, sinister joke is the mass media already act as one
trumpet for the <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Rockefeller</span>s and their ilk. The media fakers
don't need a FEMA directive to censor and falsify the news. Why
they do it every day right now!</p>
      <p>The press whores have never allowed a candid, public discussion
of the series of Executive Orders, the blueprints for
dictatorship. In a so-called "national emergency," the so-called
"head of the country" would issue martial law decrees; taking
over the farms, the factories, communications, the courts, and
the economy of the country.</p>
      <p>FEMA has computerized, crisis-action programs to control all
this. Some contend it is unconstitutional, *but* with the courts
closed... uh, after all, who would publicly proclaim the illegal
nature of these decrees?</p>
      <p>In Chicago, among the FEMA operatives are [allegedly] 7th circuit
federal appeals chief judge Richard Posner(sp?). He's also a
spokesman for <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Rockefeller</span>'s oil-soaked University of Chicago. He
is a dictator even on a quiet day!</p>
      <p>Another "FEMA Hitler" is [allegedly] Chicago federal district
judge Paul E. Plunkett(sp?).</p>
      <p>To save the Constitution, some say, "Keep our crooked President,
right or wrong."</p>
      <p>In Chicago, see us on cable TV, channel 21, 9 pm every Monday
evening in January.</p>
      <p>Play it again: The <span class="ORG" title="ORG">FBI</span> and the <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> Dirty Games. [312] 731-1505.
New message Monday; we change it several times a week. Donations
appreciated. Citizen's Committee to Clean Up the Courts, 9800
South Oglesby, Chicago, [Illinois] 60617. For the latest on
courts, banks, espionage agencies, political assassinations...</p>
