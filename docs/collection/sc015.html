      <p>Skolnick COMMENTARY #015
========================</p>
      <p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve
either all or portions of the following.]</p>
      <p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put
out by a group in Chicago called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>
      <p>Hi! Sherman Skolnick, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts
[CCCC], 9800 South Oglesby.</p>
      <p>&gt;From the time of <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span>'s election as President on -- strange
events with <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>.</p>
      <p>About the time of <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span>'s November '92 election a <span class="NORP" title="NORP">British</span>
Intelligence operative assisting <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> was murdered, together with
all his family members, in southern California. That was Ian
Stewart-Sparrow(sp?) -- having inside knowledge about the
"October Surprise" treason, the Mena, Arkansas airport dope and
gun smuggling implicating <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> as Governor, and much more.</p>
      <p>Right after <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> was inaugurated, two <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> officials were
murdered and three seriously wounded right on the road leading
into <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> headquarters -- apparently part of a fight between <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>
faction one: George Bush and his gang, and faction two: Naval
Intelligence assassins.</p>
      <p>And where does <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> fit in, huh?</p>
      <p>Right before the election some 15 [persons] were arrested --
charged with shipping exotic military items without export
licenses to known terrorists. Among the defendants, Diane
Lewis(sp?), a crony of first lady Hillary of Park Ridge, a
northwest Chicago suburb. The trial was right after inauguration
day. Ms. Lewis was released after her defense attorney told the
judge, in chambers, she was with <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> *and* a pal of Hillary.</p>
      <p>Then, the strange events in Waco, Texas, right near a <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>
brainwashing facility. Some believe some of the Branch Davidian
leaders knew too much. A <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> and military "delta team" murdered
many while tanks with flame shooters burned down the compound. In
the assault on the building two federal agents, previously
<span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span>'s campaign bodyguards, were murdered -- now get this --
*by their fellow agents*.</p>
      <p>On July 17th, '93, President <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> and/or someone in the White
House acting with them (such as Vincent Foster, jr.) stopped a
genuine <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> plot to assassinate Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein.
Two days later, <span class="ORG" title="ORG">FBI</span> director Sessions was "sacked," on flimsy
excuses, to block his investigation of President <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span>'s
treasonous activities -- such as having military officers
assigned to <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> acting as Justice Department prosecutors pursuing
political activist civilians!</p>
      <p>The next day, White House aide Foster was found murdered in a
lower level of the White House. The Secret Service removed the
body and planted it in a national park in Virginia. The
circumstances, however, were designed by someone to put <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span>
in a "catch-22" position. If <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> revealed the details, some
of it, somehow, might point to Foster's law partner and lover --
Hillary. Did she want *him* dead to save herself from prison,
huh?</p>
      <p>Some $47 million is missing from a federally insured S&amp;L in
Arkansas. Hillary and Foster were implicated in what seems to be
a bank embezzlement. Federal authorities are also investigating
<span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> money-laundering deals reportedly also implicating Hillary
and Foster.</p>
      <p>The Secret Service is holding clandestine meetings across the
nation about Foster, "picking the brains" of assassination
experts. The Secret Service contends three foreign intelligence
agents, disguised as known White House visitors, got into the
White House and "wiped out" Foster. {1}. The Secret Service also
claims a Foster "double" left the White House that afternoon --
all to confuse matters.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> is stonewalling release of pertinent records. Some claim
the series of mysteries somehow involve the role of Bill and
Hillary as <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> assets since an early age.</p>
      <p>And then there's the Rick Ames spy mess at <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> which <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> set
on for a year. {2}.</p>
      <p>(312) 731-1100 is our main message. Donations appreciated.

      <p>--------------------------<span class="special"> Notes </span>----------------------------
{1} According to a *Wall Street Journal* article dated March 10,
1994 ("Who is Patsy Thomasson?"), there has been lax security at
the White House, apparently due to poor overall management.
{2} Again from the *Wall Street Journal* of March 10, 1994 ("The
KGB and America's War on Drugs"), regarding the Ames spy case,
"some key questions have gone unasked." Ames reportedly was
involved with the KGB in narco-trafficking. The amount of cash
allegedly paid to Ames was "far more than in most treason-for-money cases."
