      <p>Skolnick COMMENTARY #009
========================</p>
      <p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve
either all or portions of the following.]</p>
      <p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put
out by a group in Chicago called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>
      <p>Hi! Sherman Skolnik, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts,
9800 Oglesby.</p>
      <p>More about the strange death of White House aide, Vincent Foster,
jr.:</p>
      <p>Hillary Rodham <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> and her law partner, Foster, worked on
clandestine deals for the Bank of Conspirators and Criminals
International [BCCI]. Interlocked with the American <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>, the
French <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> and other international spy shops like Israel's
Mossad, the bank washed funds for dope, guns, the bribery of
public officials, and political assassinations.</p>
      <p>With Foster also as Hillary's lover, Bill <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> was isolated
from what was going on. Foster found out that an American murder
squad had been transferred from <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> to the Justice Department.
Specializing in domestic "wipe outs," the squad was more bloody
than those of Guatemala and Brazil. Unknown to many, the U.S.
dealt with political opponents and activists just like they do in
a Banana Republic!</p>
      <p>Reputed murder squad chieftain has been Colonel Wayne Adrian
Rich. His position as executive coordinator in the Justice
Department gives him more actual power than the U.S. Attorney
General.</p>
      <p>(Yes, we know, it's unconstitutional to have a military officer
as the actual head of the Justice Department.)</p>
      <p>Part of "the squad" reportedly included Chicago <span class="ORG" title="ORG">FBI</span> agent Mike
"Chucky" Peters, identified in federal court records here as
indicated in the murder of some 41 federal grand jury witnesses
in the notorious <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span> affair -- covered up by former federal
district judge Nicholas J. Bowa(sp?) as special Justice
Department counsel. (Bowa has been a defendant in an unpublicized
federal suit here on the issue.)</p>
      <p>Among those bumped off by "the squad" have been journalist Danny
Casolero, working on a book on what he called "the Octopus" --
interfacing October Surprise, Iran-contra, <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span>, BCCI, Bank
Lavoro, bankruptcy court bribery, and other bloody deals.</p>
      <p>Another victim was Chicago bankruptcy auctioneer Wallace
Lieberman(sp?). According to accusations in the court record, he
was "rubbed out" by <span class="ORG" title="ORG">FBI</span> agent Peters.</p>
      <p>"The squad" also bombed the airplane, killing Gary Caradori,
private eye investigating high-level pedophile and porno rings
implicating top government officials in Omaha, Chicago, and
Washington, D.C. [see part 2 of today's "CfD"].</p>
      <p>White House aide Foster never lived to keep an appointment he
made with President <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> -- to warn him that <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> himself
was a possible assassination target *and* that <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> should do
something about the murder squad or eventually face impeachment.</p>
      <p>Knowledgeable investigators contend that <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span>'s problem is he
does not know *that he does not know* about all this.</p>
      <p>"The squad" murdered Foster and, on purpose, bungled up the scene
so as to try to "finger" Hillary and Bill for covering up the
murder of Hillary's lover and law partner.</p>
      <p>The press fakers, assets of <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>, keep calling it "suicide." Now,
to try to incriminate the President, a major news magazine is
pressuring a Virginia state prosecutor to focus on Bill and
Hillary as accomplices to murder by covering it up. Leading the
attack has been Chicago congressman Henry Hyde, head of <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>'s
"black budget" *and* having more actual power than the director
of Central Intelligence.</p>
      <p>Related matters: the murders of <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> officials outside their
headquarters *and* Admiral Bobby Ray Inman acting goofy, on
purpose, to withdraw his name as Secretary of Defense.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> may escape by a war scare. [CfD -- Skolnik was saying
he had information suggesting an imminent war scare on a
recent broadcast of Radio Free America. The broadcast occurred
shortly before the bombing in Sarajevo.]</p>
      <p>And so, it's an old story: an innocent husband wrecked by an
unfaithful, conniving wife. *And*, unless he goes public, it's
"bye-bye, Bill." It would be also "bye-bye, Hillary," huh?</p>
      <p>See us on cable TV in Chicago, channel 21. 9 pm [cst] Monday
evenings, February 14, 21, and 28.</p>
