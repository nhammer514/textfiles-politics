      <p>Skolnick COMMENTARY #017
========================</p>
      <p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve
either all or portions of the following.]</p>
      <p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put
out by a group in Chicago called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>
      <p>Hi! Sherman Skolnick, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts
[CCCC], 9800 South Oglesby.</p>
      <p>The Clinton scandal: So you think the center of it is in Little
Rock, huh? *Wrong*. The center is in Chicago.</p>
      <p>For several years, the primary lawyers for Resolution Trust
Corporation [RTC] have been the Chicago-based Hopkins and Sutter.
In fact, the S&amp;L bailout agency's principal offices have been
*inside* Hopkins and Sutter!</p>
      <p>Prior efforts to show RTC is corrupt have been torpedoed. Hopkins
[and Sutter] were the ones arranging on behalf of Federal Deposit
Insurance and their step-sister RTC for the Rose law firm to be
used to handle clean-up claims of defunct S&amp;Ls in the Chicago
area.</p>
      <p>Rose partners Vincent Foster, jr., and Hillary Rodham Clinton
were the "law fakers" helping friends escape paying millions.
Foster was also the master "bagman" for tens of millions of
dollars of illegal speculations in Chicken futures and "selling
short" pharmaceutical stocks on inside information. This was done
for a circle of law-license gangsters, like Hillary and her
friends, dealing with the selected, criminally-inclined types on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options
Exchange. (By the way, Did they "rub elbows" with relatives of
state and federal judges "washing" bribe money in the same
markets!?)</p>
      <p>Foster's vast dirty business in drug stocks overlapped the doings
of Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, and her cousin, Michael R.
Taylor, who went on to become a top honcho of the Food and Drug
Administration. Gore, of course, became Vice-President.</p>
      <p>Two federal agencies, the CFTC [Chicago Futures Trading
Commission] and the SEC [Securities Exchange Commission] are
supposed to investigate such events. *Oh, yeah?!* They and the
press fakers all look the other way so that two *known*
scoundrels could be elected to high office. The President and the
Vice-President are blackmailed by *their patrons*, the ultra-rich.</p>
      <p>Some $47 million is missing resulting from the Arkansas S&amp;L mess
and other fakery by the Clintons. To try to patch it up, some $50
million from an RTC contingency fund, *in Chicago*, was secretly
transferred to Little Rock.</p>
      <p>One of the lawyers arranging this is from Park Ridge, the Chicago
suburb where the Rodhams are from. He is John E. Gearham(?), 708-xxx-xxxx. He is close to Hillary's family. In January '94,
Gearham, in the presence of a former client, confessed to our
chairman [CCCC] that Gearham was greatly concerned that his
circle was prepared to "frame" him for the clandestine money
transfer and send him to prison! The "fix" is so strong, he
confessed further, that nothing could save him!</p>
      <p>The RTC fund is the subject of some *eight* state and federal
cases in the Chicago area, known as "the Joseph Androcetti(sp?)
Affair."</p>
      <p>Filed in federal court (and a copy served on Gearham and the
RTC's attorneys) are the particulars of Gearham's confession.
When it came up in court, they did not dispute it.</p>
      <p>We remind you why Chicago is the best place for the "big fix" --
like used by the Clintons. Remember: The currency and commodity
markets are here; preferred for "washing" bribery money by
government officials worldwide. The news media here are the
biggest liars in the land, with a *long* background of
criminality -- like the [Chicago] Tribune Company with their
links all the way back to Al Capone. *And* it's been documented
for more than 30 years the state and federal judges here are
moreso "for sale" than any other place in the land!</p>
      <p>In Chicago, see us on cable tv, channel 21, 9 pm [cst] most
Monday evenings.</p>
      <p>Play it again: The Corruption of Al Gore. (312) 731-1505.</p>
      <p>New message Friday; we change it several times a week.</p>
      <p>Donations appreciated. Citizen's Committee to Clean Up the
Courts, 9800 South Oglesby, Chicago, [Illinois] 60617. For the
latest on courts, banks, espionage agencies, political
assassinations, and the news media. On 24 hours a day.</p>
