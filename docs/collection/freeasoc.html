      <p>Subject: Leaflet: <span class="NORP">Freemasonry</span> and Society</p>
      <p>This is the text of a leaflet published by by the Board of
General Purposes of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1987.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="NORP">Freemasonry</span> and Society</p>
      <p>Introduction:
This leaflet is intended to expand a topic mentioned in the
leaflet "What is <span class="NORP">Freemasonry</span>". It explains the United Grand Lodge of
England's view on <span class="NORP">Freemasonry</span> and Society.</p>
      <p>Respect for the law:
<span class="NORP">Freemasonry</span> demands from its members a respect for the law of any
country in which a man may work and live.</p>
      <p>Principles:
The principles of <span class="NORP">Freemasonry</span> do not in any way conflict with its
members' duties as citizens, whether at work or at home or in public
life, but on the contrary should strengthen them in fulfulling their
private and public responsibilities.

Use of Membership:
A <span class="NORP">Freemason</span> must not use his membership to promote his own or
anyone else's business, professional or personal interests. This is
made clear directly or by inference several times during a Freemason's
early career so that no <span class="NORP">Freemason</span> can pretend to be ignorant of it. A
<span class="NORP">Freemason</span> who transgresses this rule may be suspended from <span class="NORP">Masonic</span>
activities or even expelled.</p>
      <p>Family:
<span class="NORP">Freemasonry</span> should not be allowed to harm a man's family or
other connections by taking too much of his time or his money or
causing him to act in any other way against their interests.</p>
      <p>Duty as a citizen:
A Freemason's duty as a citizen must always prevail over any
obligation to other <span class="NORP">Freemason</span>s, and any attempt to shield a <span class="NORP">Freemason</span>
who has acted dishonourably or unlawfully or to confer an unfair
advantage on another <span class="NORP">Freemason</span> is contrary to this prime duty.</p>
      <p>Personal or business difficulties:
If it could be proved by evidence that any personal failure or
business difficulty was attributable to '<span class="NORP">Masonic</span> influence', <span class="NORP">Masonic</span>
authority would take a serious view of the fact, as it would be
contrary to the principles of <span class="NORP">Freemasonry</span>.</p>
      <p>Secrecy:</p>
      <p>* <span class="NORP">Freemasonry</span> is not a secret society.</p>
      <p>* Like many other societies, it regards some of its internal affairs
as private matters for its members.</p>
      <p>* There is no secret about its aims and principles. Copies of the
constitutions and rules can be obtained from <span class="NORP">Freemason</span>s' Hall by
interested members of the public.</p>
      <p>* The secrets of <span class="NORP">Freemasonry</span> are concerned with its traditional modes
of recognition. Its ceremonies are private.</p>
      <p>* In ordinary conversation there is very little about <span class="NORP">Freemasonry</span>
which may not be discussed.

* On inquiry for acceptable reasons, <span class="NORP">Freemsons</span> are free and will be
proud to acknowledge their own membership.
