PAPERS PLEASE!!!!</p>
      <p> So here we go again!!! Remember not to long ago when some one talked about
SS#'s and what a pain in the ass the establishment is for using them...
Well kids get ready for this!!!! So, some of you still think you can move
around uninhibited? Let me tell you a tale, A tale of the true nature of the
establishment. For all intensive purposes lets just call myself Joe Jones.
I've lived in MA. all my life.(or for that matter, most of it..)</p>
      <p>Are you ready kiddies... this is a tale of konspiracy by big bro... (if youve seen the
movie "Brazil" youll see how all this shit happened...)</p>
      <p>1989...</p>
      <p>SALEM N.H. DMV</p>
      <p>ME: Hi, Im here to get my drivers license changed from MA. to NH....
Clerk: (2 state troopers next to him...) Yes sir do you have you're PAPERS..
ME: Yes I do, here they are. As I watched him type on his anallyretentive crt.</p>
      <p>I saw a most disturbing, puzzling look on his face... a glance to the S.S.
men brought them over to his screen... (check this shit out!!!) I looked
at the little man and he got up from the counter and left. The KGB
(Troopers) walked toward me... (I didnt like the looks of this..)</p>
      <p>TROOPERS: "JOEY JONES WOULD YOU PLEASE PUT YOURE HANDS BEHIND YOURE BACK." </p>
      <p>ME: WHAT!!!</p>
      <p>TROOPERS: "Mr. jones you are being placed under arrest for assault on a
police officer in the state of N.J...."
ME: "But I've never been to N.J.."
TROOPERS: "well theres a warrant for you're arrest..."</p>
      <p>AT THE INERMERMENT CAMP...</p>
      <p>GUARD: "Joey please fill this paperwork out."
ME: "Excuse me my name is JOE not joey, and I've never been to N.J. you've
got the wrong guy... "
GUARD: "Well you are joe Jones, correct? The HAL9000 says theres a warrant
for you're arrest."
ME: "Well I'm telling you that I'm not this guy."
GUARD: "Joe, give me your SS# and we'll see..."</p>
      <p>WHILE WAITING IN MY CELL...</p>
      <p>GUARD: "Joe, sorry we didnt know that joey is 2" shorter and has different
color eyes.. you see Mr.Jones, NJ doesnt use SS#'s only birth dates and
discriptions... were terrible sorry that you had to spend the night here."</p>
      <p>ME: "Thats ok IT could happen to any one...(but it happened to me!!!)"</p>
      <p>DETERMINED NOT TO LET THIS HAPPEN AGIAN...
Well I got the PAPERS in the mail today from NJ and they state
Mr. joe jones SS# 010-00-0110 has never had any outstanding criminal
or civil charges brought against him in the great state of NJ.</p>
      <p>TWO YEARS LATER IN MAINE.</p>
      <p>TROOPER: "Sir the reason I stopped you was because of your speeding.. may I
see you're PAPERS PLEASE."</p>
      <p>As he marched back to his chariot of facism I thought, Shit I am gonna get
busted for joey again worst I didn't have the PAPERS NJ sent me.</p>
      <p>Guess What.. Kuffed &amp; stuffed again, on my bloody vacation.
Two days later with the aid of several friends, fed express &amp; the great
state of NJ. i once again am a free man..</p>
