      <p>THE INFLUENCE OF VEDIC PHILOSOPHY ON NIKOLA TESLA'S UNSTANDIING FREE ENERGY</p>
      <p> "The first thing to realize about the ether is its absolute
continuity. A deep sea fish has probably no means of
apprehending the existence of water; it is too uniformly
immersed in it: and that is our condition in regard to the
ether."
Sir Oliver Lodge, Ether and Reality.</p>
      <p> ABSTRACT</p>
      <p> Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> used ancient Sanskrit terminology in his descriptions of
natural phenomena. As early as 1891 <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> described the universe as a
kinetic system filled with energy which could be harnessed at any
location. His concepts during the following years were greatly
influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda. Swami Vivekananda
was the first of a succession of eastern yogi's who brought Vedic
philosophy and religion to the west. After meeting the Swami and after
continued study of the Eastern view of the mechanisms driving the
material world, <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> began using the Sanskrit words Akasha, Prana, and
the concept of a luminiferous ether to describe the source, existence
and construction of matter. This paper will trace the development of
<span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>'s understanding of Vedic Science, his correspondence with Lord
Kelvin concerning these matters, and the relation between <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> and
Walter Russell and other turn of the century scientists concerning
advanced understanding of physics. Finally, after being obscured for
many years, the author will give a description of what he believes is
the the pre-requisite for the free energy systems envisioned by <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> .</p>
      <p> TESLA'S EARLIER DESCRIPTION OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE</p>
      <p> By the year 1891, Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> had invented many useful devices.
These included a system of arc lighting (1886), the alternating current
motor, power generation and transmission systems (1888), systems of
electrical conversion and distribution by oscillatory discharges
(1889), and a generator of high frequency currents (1890), to name a
few. The most well known patent centers around an inspiration that
occurred while walking with a friend in a park in Budapest, Hungry. It
was while observing the sunset that <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> had a vision of how rotating
electromagnetic fields could be used in a new form of electric motor.
This led to the well known system of alternating current power
distribution. In 1891 however, <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> patented what one day may become
his most famous invention. It is the basis for the wireless
transmission of electrical power and is know as the <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> Coil
Transformer. It was during this year that <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> made the following
comments during a speech before the American Institute of Electrical</p>
      <p> Engineers;</p>
      <p> "Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be driven by
a power obtainable at any point in the universe. This idea
is not novel... We find it in the delightful myth of
Antheus, who derives power from the earth; we find it among
the subtle speculations of one of your splendid
mathematicians... Throughout space there is energy. Is
this energy static or kinetic.? If static our hopes are in
vain; if kinetic - and this we know it is, for certain -
then it is a mere question of time when men will succeed
in attaching their machinery to the very wheelwork of
nature." 1</p>
      <p> This description of the physical mechanisms of the universe was given
before <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> became familiar with the Vedic science of the eastern
Nations of India, Tibet, and Nepal. This science was first popualized
in the United States and the west during the three year visit of Swami
Vivekananda.</p>
      <p> VEDIC SCIENCE AND SWAMI VIVEKANANDA</p>
      <p> The Vedas are a collection of writings consisting of hymns, prayers,
myths, historical accounting, dissertations on science, and the nature
of reality, which date back at least 5000 years. The nature of
matter, antimatter, and the make up of atomic structure are described
in the Vedas. The language of the Vedas is known as Sanskrit. The
origin of Sanskrit is not fully understood. Western scholars suggest
that it was brought into the Himalayas and thence south into India by
the southward migrations of the Aryan culture. Paramahansa Yogananda
and other historians however do not subscribe to that theory, pointing
out that there is no evidence within India to substantiate such
claims. 2</p>
      <p> There are words in Sanskrit that describe concepts totally foreign to
the western mind. Single words may require a full paragraph for
translation into english. Having studied Sanskrit for a brief period
during the late 70's, it finally occurred to this writer that <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>'s
use of Vedic terminology could provide a key to understanding his view
of electromagnetism and the nature of the universe. But where did
<span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> learn Vedic concepts and Sanskrit terminology? A review of the
well known biographies by Cheney, Hunt and Draper, and O'Neil 345,
reveal no mention of <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>'s knowledge of Sanskrit. O'Neal however
includes the following excerpt from an unpublished article called Man's
Greatest Achievement;</p>
      <p> "There manifests itself in the fully developed being , Man,
a desire mysterious, inscrutable and irresistible: to
imitate nature, to create, to work himself the wonders he
perceives.... Long ago he recognized that all
perceptible matter comes from a primary substance, or
tenuity beyond conception, filling all space, the Akasha or
luminiferous ether, which is acted upon by the life giving</p>
      <p> Prana or creative force, calling into existence, in never
ending cycles all things and phenomena. The primary
substance, thrown into infinitesimal whirls of
prodigious velocity, becomes gross matter; the force
subsiding, the motion ceases and matter disappears,
reverting to the primary substance."
According to Leland Anderson the article was written May 13th,
1907. Anderson also suggested that it was through association with
Swami Vivekananda that <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> may have come into contact with Sanskrit
terminology and that John Dobson of the San Francisco Sidewalk
Astronomers Association had researched that association. 6</p>
      <p> Swami Vivekananda was born in Calcutta, India in 1863. He was
inspired by his teacher, <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Ramakrishna</span> to serve men as visible
manifestations of God. In 1893 Swami Vivekananda began a tour of the
west by attending the Parliament of Religions held in Chicago. During
the three years that he toured the United States and Europe,
Vivekananda met with many of the well known scientists of the time
including Lord Kelvin and Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>. 7 According to Swami
Nikhilananda;</p>
      <p> Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>, the great scientist who specialized in the
field of electricity, was much impressed to hear from the
Swami his explanation of the Samkhya cosmogony and the theory
of cycles given by the Hindus. He was particularly struck by
the resemblance between the Samkhya theory of matter and
energy and that of modern physics. The Swami also met in New
York Sir William Thompson, afterwards Lord Kelvin, and
Professor Helmholtz, two leading representatives of western
science. Sarah Bernhardt, the famous French actress had an
interview with the Swami and greatly admired his teachings. 8</p>
      <p> It was at a party given by Sarah Bernhardt that Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> probably
first met Swami Vivekananda. 9 Sarah Bernhardt was playing the part of
'Iziel' in a play of the same name. It was a French version about the
life of Bhudda. The actress upon seeing Swami Vivekananda in the
audience, arranged a meeting which was also attended by Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>.
In a letter to a friend, dated February 13th, 1896, Swami Vivekananda
noted the following;</p>
      <p> ...Mr. <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> was charmed to hear about the Vedantic Prana
and Akasha and the Kalpas, which according to him are the
only theories modern science can entertain.....Mr <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>
thinks he can demonstrate that mathematically that force and
matter are reducible to potential energy. I am to go see him
next week to get this mathematical demonstration. 10</p>
      <p> Swami Vivekananda was hopeful that <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> would be able to show that
what we call matter is simply potential energy because that would
reconcile the teachings of the Vedas with modern science. The Swami
realized that "In that case, the Vedantic cosmology [would] be placed
on the surest of foundations". The harmony between Vedantic theories
and and western science was explained by the following diagram;</p>
      <p> BRAHMAN = THE ABSOLUTE
|
MAHAT OR <span class="NORP" title="NORP">ISHVARA</span> = PRIMAL CREATIVE ENERGY
+---------+ +---------+
PRANA and AKASHA = ENERGY and MATTER</p>
      <p>
         <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> understood the Sanskrit terminology and philosophy and found
that it was a good means to describe the physical mechanisms of the
universe as seen through his eyes. It would behoove those who would
attempt to understand the science behind the inventions of Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>
to study Sanskrit and Vedic philosophy.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> apparently failed to show the identity of energy and matter.
If he had, certainly Swami Vivekananda would have recorded that
occasion. The mathematical proof of the principle did come until
about ten years later when Albert Einstein published his paper on
relativity. What had been known in the East for the last 5000 years
was then known to the West.</p>
      <p> Brahman is defined as the one self existent impersonal spirit; the
Divine Essence, from which all things emanate, by which they are
sustained, and to which they return. Notice that this is very similar
to the concept of the Great Spirit as understood by Native American
cultures. Ishvara is the Supreme Ruler; the highest possible
conception of the Absolute, which is beyond all thought. Mahat means
literally the Great One, and is also interpreted as meaning universal
mind or cosmic intelligence. Prana means energy (usually translated as
life force) and Akasha means matter (usually translated as ether).
Dobson points out that the more common translations for Akasha and
Prana are not quite correct, but that <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> did understand their true
meanings.</p>
      <p> The meeting with Swami Vivekananda greatly stimulated Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>'s
interest in Eastern Science. The Swami later remarked during a lecture
in India, "I myself have been told by some of the best scientific minds
of the day, how wonderfully rational the conclusions of the Vedanta
are. I know of one of them personally, who scarcely has time to eat
his meal, or go out of his laboratory, but who would stand by the hour
to attend my lectures on the Vedanta; for, as he expresses it, they are
so scientific, they so exactly harmonize with the aspirations of the
age and with the conclusions to which modern science is coming at the
present time". 11</p>
      <p> TESLA AND LORD KELVIN</p>
      <p> William S. Thompson was one of the prominent scientists and engineers
of the 1800s. He developed analogies between heat and electricity and
his work influenced the theories developed by James Clerk <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Maxwell</span>, one
of the founders of electromagnetic theory. Thompson supervised the
successful laying of the Trans Atlantic Cable and for that work was
knighted Lord Kelvin. Kelvin had endorsed <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>'s theories and proposed
system for the wireless transmission of electrical power. 12 FootNOTE-Grotz PACE</p>
      <p>
         <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> continued to study Hindu and Vedic philosophy for a number of
years as indicated by the following letter written to him by Lord
Kelvin.</p>
      <p> 15, Eaton Place
London, S.W.
May 20, 1902</p>
      <p> Dear Mr. <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>,</p>
      <p> I do not know how I can ever thank you enough for the
most kind letter of May, 10, which I found in my cabin in the
Lucania, with the beautiful books which you most kindly sent
me along with it: -"The Buried Temple", "The Gospel of
Bhudda", Les Grands Inities", the exquisite edition of
Rossetti's "House of Life", and last but not least the
Century Magazine for June, 1900 with the splendid and
marvelous photographs on pp. 176, 187, 190, 191, 192, full of
electrical lessons.</p>
      <p> We had a most beautiful passage across the Atlantic, much
the finest I have ever had. I was trying hard nearly all the
way, but quite unsuccessfully, to find something definite as
to the functions of ether in respect to plain, old fashioned
magnetism. A propos of this, I have instructed the
publishers, Messrs. Macmillan, to send you at the Waldorf a
copy of my book (Collection of Separate Papers) on
Electrostatics and Magnetism. I shall be glad if you will
accept it from me as a very small mark of my gratitude to you
for your kindness. You may possibly find something
interesting in the articles on Atmospheric Electricity which
it contains.</p>
      <p> Lady Kelvin joins me in kind regards, and I remain,</p>
      <p> Yours always truly,</p>
      <p> Kelvin</p>
      <p> Thank you also warmly for the beautiful flowers 13</p>
      <p> TESLA AND RUSSELL</p>
      <p> Walter Russell was one of the most accomplished artists, sculptors,
writers and scientists of this century. His periodic chart of the
elements accurately predicted the location and characteristics of four
elements years before they were discovered in laboratories. These are
now known as Deuterium, Tritium, Neptunium, and Plutonium. Russell</p>
      <p> apparently entered into a heightened state of awareness after being
struck by lightning. He began several weeks of drawing and writing
about the basic nature and make up of the physical universe. Russells'
family finally called the family doctor to determine if Russell should
be committed to an mental institution. The doctor, upon seeing the
results of Russells weeks of work, said that he did not know what
Russell was doing, but that he definitely was not mad.</p>
      <p> Although the exact time and occasion of their meeting has not yet
been determined, Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> and Walter Russell did meet and discuss
their respective cosmologies. 14 <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> recognized the wisdom and power
of Russells' teaching and urged Russell to lock up his knowledge in a
safe for 1000 years until man was ready for it. 15</p>
      <p> WHY FREE ENERGY HASN'T HAPPENED YET</p>
      <p> COMMENTS, POSSIBILITIES AND SOCIO ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS</p>
      <p> Although <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> did not accept many of the tenants of relativity and
quantum theory and never made the connection between matter and
energy, he did recognize the possibility of free and unlimited energy
as demonstrated by the following statement.</p>
      <p> Can Man control [the ] grandest, most awe inspiring of all processes
in nature?...If he could do this, he would have powers almost unlimited
and supernatural... He could cause planes to collide and produce his
suns and stars, his heat and light. He could originate and develop
life in all its infinite forms....[Such powers] would place him beside
his creator, make him fulfill his ultimate destiny. 16</p>
      <p> We see that <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> is asking a question, speculating, searching for an
answer. If <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> had developed free energy sources or learned how to
manipulate space time and gravity, during the time of his most public
and productive years, (up until about 1920), he would have had answers
to those questions.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>'s most misunderstood invention is popularly known as the "Death
Ray". It was simply a particle beam weapon which he proposed in 1937
and was fabricated under contracts with Alcoa Aluminum and the English
and Italian governments. 17 It used electrostatic propulsion
techniques and similar devices are being developed today by the
Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) and the US Army
Strategic Defense Command. 18</p>
      <p> So we see that mankind has not yet harnessed the infinite power of
the universe as envisioned by Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>. The question remains, why
not?</p>
      <p> Free energy devices, if they are feasible, are not about smaller
faster microcircuits or a bigger better mouse traps. This is a
technology which may revolutionize the socio-economic status quo on
planet Earth. At this moment the big pie is unevenly divided. One
quarter of the population on this rock, the third stone from the sun,
consumes three quarters of the yearly resource output. As one can
easily deduce, from a brief study of world affairs, there are about</p>
      <p> three billion people who have just about had it with this scenario.
There are wars starvation and strife in every nook and cranny of the
planet. So what do we do about it?</p>
      <p> Spaceship Earth Needs A Flight Plan</p>
      <p> Either we divide the pie more evenly or we make the pie larger. The
first option requires that our standard of living must fall so that the
standard of living in the third world may rise. The second option
allows us to maintain our standard of living while we help raise the
standard of living of under privileged nations. This we must do. It
is our destiny. It is our responsibility. It is our final test.</p>
      <p> Thirty thousand people starve to death every day on this planet, most
of them are children. Nations fight nations, war is part of our lives.
What drives our economy in the western world, allows us to enjoy a high
standard of living, a life of leisure compared to our neighbors south
of the imaginary line called a border? Many answers both economic,
social, political, and spiritual can be given. We do know that the
standard of living that a nation enjoys is directly related energy
consumption.</p>
      <p> Energy drives the economies of nations and <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>'s life long goal was
to make electric power equally available to all people any where on
this planet. He continued to promote his plan for the wireless
transmission of power in the yearly interviews he gave on his birthday
as late as 1940. 19 Electrical power allows on site processing of raw
materials. Electrical power can run pumps from water wells in areas
affected by drought. Electrical power delivered to the poverty
stricken areas of the world can make the pie larger, can help bring
about the needed economic equality which is our birth right.</p>
      <p> Why hasn't power been made equally available to all people and
nations? Why haven't the much touted free energy devices described by
Tom Bearden, John Bedini, Bruce DePalma, and others ever materialized?
Perhaps because "easy things are seldom done for the same reason that
impossible things are rarely done: no one will pay for anything
believed to be easy or impossible". 20 Perhaps because when we talk
about power there is more there than one would initially visualize.
What we are talking about is personal power, national power, planetary
power, karmic power and the power of love.</p>
      <p> The sages tell us that in order to enjoy power we have to let go of
power, to overcome ourselves. As an example this author can describe
one of his recent experiences. After a very successful symposium
celebrating the 100th year after Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> arrived in the United
States 21, a non profit corporation, 501(c)(3), was formed specifically
to encourage and pursue research into the inventions and discoveries of
Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>. Two years later, after a second symposium, several of
the founding members approached the board of directors with a proposal
to validate <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>'s claim that wireless transmission of power was
possible. Board members suggested that permission be obtained from the
FCC, an environmental impact statement be filed with the EPA, and we
should go form "our own non profit corporation". 22 It was also
decided that since there was no procedure to cover research, the</p>
      <p> organization could not be involved.</p>
      <p> Another goal of the organization had been to establish a museum to be
named the Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> Museum of Science and Technology. We proposed
that since 60 -70 billion dollars are given away to non profit
organizations annually, we had as good a chance as any other
organization for obtaining funding, for a museum or research. We
reasoned that:</p>
      <p> "Since only 16% of the museums in this country are science
museums, this museum in honor of Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> will help educate the
public in technological areas. With the need for economic
revitalization of industry in Colorado, 1986is the time to begin
supporting the scientific education of our region. With the current
statistics showing that the United States is falling behind the world
technologically, the effort to educate the public is becoming more
important, and the surge of public awareness of Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>'s
inventions makes him an appropriate namesake for a science and
technology museum." 23</p>
      <p> The board moved to table our proposal indefinitely.</p>
      <p> What had happened? Of the 15 - 20 people that had started the
organization only four remained as part of the governing body. Three
of those members were opposed to research. The collective mind of the
board of directors had become the antithesis of the momentum <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> had
gained in his lifetime. Unlike the independent inventor and
businessman, the board was now composed of members who were bureaucrats
and paper pushers for Fortune 500 companies. <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> was a vegetarian,
the board members all ate meat. <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> did not ask for permission to be
inventive and strike out on bold new adventures, the board needed
approval from higher sources. The dichotomies were endless.</p>
      <p>
         <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>'s visions have been delayed for 89 years. The squabbling
started with Thomas Edison, J.P. Morgan and Nikola <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> himself. 24 It
continues to this day. Perhaps the reason for the delay of wireless
power transmission or free energy devices lies even deeper within the
human psyche. Is it possible that we could compare the <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> story to
a biblical story? Bruce Gordan thinks so. In Gordan's analysis
<span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>'s attempt at building a prototype magnifying transmitter
parallels Genesis 11:1-9. 25</p>
      <p> "The message; human curiosity and technological derring-do makes God
nervous; God demolishes project, confounds language". Gordan further
outlines the the scenario as follows:</p>
      <p> "ISOMORPHISM"</p>
      <p> BIBLE STORY TESLA TALE</p>
      <p> Human Efforts <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span> Projects

God Money (J.P. Morgan)</p>
      <p> Demolition and Confounding to maintain Withdrawal of Morgan's
Status Quo of God drunk on power above, Financial Support and</p>
      <p> humanity groveling in ignorance below. subsequent suppression of
<span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Tesla</span>'s work in orthodox
science &amp; engineering circles
Perpetuation of mediocre
technology for energy
generation, storage,distribu-tion, to maintain favorable
cash flow for existing system
for energy management by
forcing continued combustion
of scarce fuels, keep
consumers, paying, paying,
paying......</p>
      <p> "When everything is perfect, the right time shows up." 26 This is
equivalent to saying, "Absolute knowledge in the hands of one whose
heart is not yet tender, would be a terrible weapon. 27 We might postulate that technological developments do not occur until
the planet is ready. The recent examination of the theory of Gaia
credits the Earth with an intelligence. "Thousands of years ago, by
means of seeing, sorcerers became aware that the Earth was sentinent
and that its awareness could affect the awareness of humans." 28 By
implication of reciprocity the reverse could be true. The group or
collective unconscious is still struggling with the result of quantum
and relativity theory. We as a race were ready for nuclear power,
every thing was perfect and the right time showed up. Soon we will
have put the technology to good use or abandon it to insure our
survival as a species.</p>
      <p> SO WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT</p>
      <p> FREE ENERGY: CREATING AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME</p>
      <p> Wireless transmission of power and free energy have not happened yet,
perhaps we aren't ready, perhaps the Earth isn't ready. Pogo said it
best, " we have met the enemy and it is us." In the Jungian view of
collective unconscious, things happen when the time is right, we get
what we agree to. We need a flight plan. And that plan must realize
that,</p>
