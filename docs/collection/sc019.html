      <p>Skolnick COMMENTARY #019
========================</p>
      <p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve
either all or portions of the following.]</p>
      <p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put
out by a group in Chicago called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>
      <p>Hi! Sherman Skolnick, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts
[CCCC], 9800 South Oglesby.</p>
      <p>On the business and financial level, there really is no
difference between democrats and republicans. They all scratch
each other's back. As a center of power, Chicago is a good
example.</p>
      <p>Although not a city employee, Jeremiah Joyce reportedly has an
unmarked office in City Hall. He's more powerful than Chicago
mayor Richie Daley. Joyce and Daley reportedly own Glenrock
Company (<span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Northlake</span>, Illinois, Brookfield, Wisconsin, and
<span class="NORP" title="NORP">Indianapolis</span>, <span class="NORP" title="NORP">Indiana</span>). They distribute construction supplies of
chemicals and GE [General Electric] sealants.</p>
      <p>Whether democrat or republican, state contractors in Wisconsin,
<span class="NORP" title="NORP">Indiana</span>, and Illinois *know* they have to buy their supplies from
Glenrock, such as -- tens of millions of dollars of curing
compounds for pouring cement and wire mesh for state highways;
materials for parking lots, airport runways, bridges and
buildings; such as sealants for windows, joints, masonry and
other construction; waterproofing and weatherproofing for a long
list of construction applications.</p>
      <p>Since the state contractors buy their own supplies from Glenrock
Company to fulfill a state contract, well, Glenrock's name does
generally not show in public records. Well of course, Richie
Daley and his reputed business partner, Jeremiah Joyce, like this
secretive nature of doing things.</p>
      <p>The popular press avoided mentioning the business interests of
Richie's father, Richard J. Daley, when he was mayor for 21
years. *And* they avoid saying a single word about Richie's
financial interests.</p>
      <p>A natural question is, Do state highway contractors and such give
"kickbacks," huh? Well, some think so. Well why else does their
firm, Glenrock Company, seem to be favored by contractors? Since
they distribute items such as GE sealants, you can see why NBC --
owned by General Electric [GE] -- is silent about all this. GE
also heavily finances so-called "public t.v." such as channel 11
[PBS] in Chicago.</p>
      <p>And, some raise dark questions about where the money came from
for Joyce and Daley to be in such a tremendous business. Joyce's
son was tied to dope king John Kempis(?). Two of "junior's" [i.e.
Joyce's son] friends were murdered. Kempis might have escaped
prosecution -- except he put out a murder contract on Joyce's
son. Thereafter, the highly political and corrupt federal
prosecutor in Chicago sprung into action, publicizing Kempis'
dope trafficking and putting him in jail.</p>
      <p>Knowledgeable law enforcement people contend that Richie Daley &amp;
Co. are the apex of the dope business, *and* are "untouchable"
because they have plugged into big business, whether republican
or democrat.</p>
      <p>About March, 1992, took place a strange event. A powerful,
sophisticated bomb was discovered under the floor, of the 5th
floor, in Chicago's City Hall. That's where the mayor's office
is. It was described as a "triple-trigger type [bomb]," perfected
years ago by the Germans and hard to de-fuse. News editors here
knew about this event, but suppressed it. Risking much bloodshed,
Daley did not inform his City Hall employees to "clear out"
[evacuate the building] during the dangerous period when the bomb
was being de-activated.</p>
      <p>Now some think that all of this was a warning by some financial
group trying to "muscle in" on Daley and super honcho, Jeremiah
Joyce.</p>
      <p>Tell the news-fakers to stop kidding us that there's a difference
between the democrats and the republicans.</p>
      <p>In Chicago, see us on cable tv, channel 21, 9 pm [cst] most
Monday evenings.</p>

family; (312) 731-1505.</p>
