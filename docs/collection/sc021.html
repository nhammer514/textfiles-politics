         <p>Skolnick COMMENTARY #021
========================</p>
         <p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve
either all or portions of the following.]</p>
         <p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put
out by a group in Chicago called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>
         <p>Hi! Sherman Skolnick, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts
[CCCC], 9800 South Oglesby.</p>
         <p>Can a leopard change its spots?</p>
         <p>Over the years the *Chicago Tribune* has been a crooked, anti-labor, discriminatory operation. Starting in the 19th century,
they got lucrative rights to newsprint and pulp production in
<span class="GPE" title="GPE">Canada</span> through a charter from the highly-secretive Jesuits and
the King of England. To this day the *Tribune* is tied to the
Royal Family and says nothing about them being in worldwide
financing of dope traffic through Hong Kong and the Cayman
islands.</p>
         <p>In the 1930s, the *Tribune* was facing a labor dispute. So, they
brought in Al Capone as a "labor consultant." He terrorized the
workers.</p>
         <p>Since about 1910, the *Tribune* used a family of criminals
originally from Chicago -- the Annenbergs(?) and their
descendants -- even now, to control the circulation department.</p>
         <p>In years ago when there were almost a dozen Chicago papers, the
Annenbergs used shoot-outs to "snuff out" competitors. The
Annenbergs were major stockholders in the long-time criminal
enterprise called the American National Bank here. They have
other news fakers in their pocket, such as Walter Jacobson.</p>
         <p>The *Tribune* was known for running items with snide remarks --
anti-black, anti-<span class="NORP" title="NORP">Jew</span>.</p>
         <p>Once a private company, the *Tribune* company had a dispute
between the major owners like the Marshall Fields and the
<span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Rockefellers</span> *and* minority owners.</p>
         <p>Chicago federal district judge Crowley was blackmailed into
favoring the big shots. Although one of the youngest on the
federal bench, he soon thereafter resigned.</p>
         <p>The <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Rockefellers</span> and such wanted to be bought out so, in 1981,
the *Tribune* company stock went public. Some thought that they
toned down, thereafter, their highly prejudiced stories. Oh yeah?</p>
         <p>To fatten their stockholders, the *Tribune* vowed to dump their
organized workers and smash the union. Since ensued a labor
dispute. One night the *Tribune* sent in their vicious guards
with attack dogs to rip the workers off the machines. To continue
production, the Tribune brought in "scabs" -- mostly white,
rural, southern workers (at half the wages) -- for the highly
automated new plant called "The Freedom Center." The *Tribune*
used their advance, inside information to blackmail a Chancery
Division judge to grant an injunction restricting picketing near
what savvy folks call, "The Slavery Center."</p>
         <p>Rightfully, it can't be called the *Chicago* Tribune since as
little as 15% of their total circulation is inside the city
limits. With its media octopus worldwide, it should be called
"The Multinational Lie Machine."</p>
         <p>To try to boost city circulation, the *Tribune* runs items
talking down their nose at blacks -- as if all blacks are dopers
engaged in drive-by shootings.</p>
         <p>About 1984, joke faker Mike Royko left the *<span class="LOC" title="LOC">Sun</span> Times* and went
to the *Chicago Tribune*. The *<span class="LOC" title="LOC">Sun</span> Times* sued the *Tribune*,
*but* the *Tribune* had advance, inside data on a Chancery
Division judge taking bribes. And so, the case was steered to
him. The *Tribune* blackmailed the judge into ruling in favor of
"The Slavery Center" at the Tribune Tower.</p>
         <p>And the *Tribune* company newslords have peddled false stories
that were really political assassinations. Such as of Chicago's
first black mayor, Harold Washington, died of a heart attack
because he was overweight. *Oh yeah?* The story should have been
that Harold Washington was murdered with a poisoned cup of
coffee. Some of the doctors told the media fakers that the mayor
was poisoned -- *but*, the press invoked "national security,"
contending it would cause riots. Well, what about the old
statement, "Let the truth be told, 'though the heavens crumble,"
huh?</p>
