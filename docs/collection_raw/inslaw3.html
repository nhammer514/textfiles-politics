---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Murder in the Martinsburg Sheraton?
By Joel Bleifuss</p>
         <p> For more than a year, Danny Casolaro, a Washington D.C.-based
freelance investigator, had been sorting through a web of intrigue-
-the S&amp;L debacle, BCCI, Iran-Contra, the contra-connected <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Wackenhut</span>
Corp., the <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Wackenhut</span>-connected <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span> case, and the <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span>-connected
"October Surprise."
According to one of his close friends, who asked not to be named,
Casolaro began receiving death threats eight or nine months ago.
"Brother, just make it quick," Casolaro is reported to have told one
of these midnight callers. The last threat came on Monday, August
5, according to his brother, Anthony.
How quick death came we may never know. On Saturday, August 10,
Casolaro was found dead in Room 517 of the Martinsburg, W. Va.,
Sheraton. His body was discovered with 12 incisions in his arms in
a bathtub of bloody water 17 hours after he had called his mother's
house at 6 p.m. Friday to say he was heading home but that he would
not make it to his niece's birthday party. On the following Monday
Martinsburg authorities notified the family of Casolaro's death, but
by then the body had been embalmed and the motel room had been
sanitized by a cleaning contractor. Officials are calling the
incident an "unattended death" while they continue their
investigation. Family and friends say that suicide is out of the
question. They maintain that Casolaro was not a depressive type,
and that while he did have financial problems, he did not dwell on
them.
According to family and friends, before leaving for Martinsburg,
Casolaro had been ecstatic. The pieces of the puzzle were finally
fitting together. He had told them he was going to West Virginia to
meet a source who was to help him nail down a last piece of evidence
in his investigation into the <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span> software-theft case.
Those close to Casolaro want many questions answered. Where is
his ever-present briefcase? It was not in motel room. Where is his
tape deck? It is missing. Where were his notes and the outline of
his proposed book, "Behold a Pale Horse," which he had shown to
friends days before his death? The documents were not to found in
the Sheraton motel room or in the four boxes of his papers that the
family turned over to <span class="ORG" title="ORG">ABC</span> News. Why did authorities wait so long to
notify the family of his death? His driver's license said he lived
in Falls Church, Va., and all the Casolaros listed in the 703 area
code are his relatives. Why was his body embalmed before the family
was notified? West Virginia law requires family approval prior to
embalming. Who was the man who telephoned Casolaro's house on
Saturday evening? When a housekeeper picked up the phone, a voice
said, "You're dead, you bastard."</p>
         <p> MOTIVE FOR MURDER? What was Casolaro investigating that could have
put his life in such danger? David MacMichael is a former <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>
analyst who now directs the Washington office of the Association of
National Security Alumni, a watchdog group. MacMichael had talked
to Casolaro on the phone on Thursday, the day he left for
Martinsburg. Casolaro had made an appointment to meet with him.
Says MacMichael, "Providing the death was not a suicide, one can
examine three scenarios." First, Casolaro was developing a theory
that a group of former intelligence officers were members of a for-profit cabal that Casolaro called "The Octopus." According to his
theory, over the past 25 years The Octopus had its tentacles in a
number of international scandals. MacMichael doesn't think such a
far-fetched-sounding theory would get Casolaro killed. "If you
published their names, pictures and documents, what kind of book
would you have?" asks MacMichael. It would be dismissed, according
to MacMichael, like "a <span class="EVENT" title="EVENT">UFO</span> crank book."
Second, Casolaro was looking into the October Surprise, the
alleged deal between the 1980 <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Reagan</span> presidential campaign and
Iranians. That his death would be connected to this investigation
is "nonsense" says MacMichael, who explains that many journalists
are now investigating the 1980 deal, making it unlikely that
Casolaro had information significant enough to endanger his life.
Which leads to the third scenario, that Casolaro was on his way
to collect the final evidence needed to wrap up his investigation of
a scandal that, as MacMichael put it, involves "real crimes, real
people and real money"--the <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span> case. (See "In These Times," May
29 ["Software Pirates" posted on-line previously].)</p>
         <p> INSLAW MEETS THE LAW: For eight years, <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span> Inc, has been
battling the Justice Department for possession of Promis, an
innovative case-management software program developed by company
owner Bill Hamilton. In 1986 <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span> filed suit against the
department in federal court, claiming the department had stolen the
program.
In September 1987, Judge George Bason, the federal bankruptcy
judge from Washington, D.C., ruled, "The Department of Justice took,
converted, stole <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span>'s enhanced Promis by trickery, fraud and
deceit." He also charged, "The failure even to begin in investigate
[these charges] is outrageous and indefensible and constitutes an
institutional decision by the Department of Justice at the highest
level simply to ignore charges of impropriety."
The Justice Department appealed the ruling, and in November 1989,
Judge William B. Bryant of the U.S. District Court in Washington
affirmed the lower court's decision. He ruled, "The government
acted willfully and fraudulently to obtain property that it was not
entitled to under contract.
The Justice Department then appealed Bryant's ruling to the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. On May 7 that court
overturned the previous court decisions, saying the federal
bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. However, the
Court of Appeals left the findings of fact undisturbed.
Earlier this year, the case took a new twist. <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span> went public
with allegations that the <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Reagan</span> Justice Department, after it had
stolen the Promis software, turned it over to Earl Brian, a friend
of both former President Ronald <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Reagan</span> and former Attorney General
Edwin Meese. In 1974, Brian left then-California Gov. <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Reagan</span>'s
cabinet.
<span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span> alleges that its software was given to Brian as a payback
for Brian's help in arranging the arms-and-hostages deal between the
1980 <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Reagan</span>-Bush campaign and representatives of the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini (see "In These Times," July 24, 1987, Oct. 12,
1988, and April 27, 1991). According to <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span> owner Bill Hamilton,
Brian, who runs United Press International, allegedly then marketed
Promis to the intelligence agencies of Israel, Jordan, Iraq, <span class="GPE" title="GPE">Canada</span>,
South Korea, Libya, Great Britain, Germany, France, Australia,
Thailand, Japan, Chile, Guatemala and Brazil. According to <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span>'s
scenario, once the software was in use by foreign intelligence
services, the U.S. National Security Agency would then be able to
infiltrate the computerized intelligence files of these countries.
Modifications on the pirated software were allegedly carried out by
the <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Wackenhut</span> Corp. of Coral Gables, Fla.</p>
         <p> WHERE IS JUSTICE?: <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span>'s attorney, Elliot Richardson, the Nixon
attorney general who resigned rather than participate in the
Watergate cover-up, has long asked for the appointment of a special
prosecutor to investigate the Justice Department's handling of the
case. But to no avail.
The House Judiciary Committee has been investigating the scandal
since August 1989. After months of foot-dragging, Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh, under subpoena by the committee, finally
released <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span>-related files. However, according to a source in
the House, 15 to 20 files are missing.
"Washington Post" columnist Mary McGrory is one of the few
mainstream journalists to give the <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span> case serious attention.
She wrote on August 18, "The man who could have resolved the <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span>
case, Dick Thornburgh, resigned as attorney general on the day the
West Virginia police came forward with their autopsy [on Casolaro].
Excess was the hallmark of the Thornburgh's farewell ceremony: an
honor guard, a trooping of the colors, superlatives form
subordinates. William P. Barr, his deputy and possible successor,
spoke of Thornburgh's 'leadership, integrity, professionalism and
fairness'--none of which Thornburgh displayed in his handling of
<span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span>. What was merely sinister has now turned deadly. Thornburgh
calls <span class="ORG" title="ORG">Inslaw</span> 'a little contract dispute' and refused to testify
about it to the House Judiciary Committee. Richardson thinks it
could be 'dirtier than Watergate,' and, as a victim of the scandal,
he should know. Thornburgh's conduct is the most powerful reason
for believing that Danny Casolaro really saw an octopus before he
died."
And in the wake of Casolaro's death, Richardson has repeated his
call for a special prosecutor. He told the "Boston Globe"'s John
Aloysius Farrell, "It's hard to come up with any reason for his
death other than he was deliberately murdered because he was close
to uncovering sinister elements in what he called 'The Octopus.'
This simply strengthens the case for an in-depth, hard-hitting,
thorough investigation."
But will there be one? The <span class="ORG" title="ORG">FBI</span> is treating the death lightly.
According to a spokesman in the Pittsburgh office, which has
jurisdiction over West Virginia, "There is no federal investigative
interest in the matter."
As for former Attorney General Thornburgh, he is now running for
the Senate in <span class="GPE" title="GPE">Pennsylvania</span>. If Justice is served, perhaps he will
also run for cover.</p>
