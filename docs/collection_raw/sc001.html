Skolnick COMMENTARY #001
========================</p>
         <p>Hi. Sherman Skolnik, Citizen's Committee to Clean Up the Courts,
9800 Oglesby.</p>
         <p>At one time the Pope owned three major banks in America: New
York, Chicago and San Francisco.</p>
         <p>In <span class="GPE" title="GPE">New York</span>, St. Peter's banker, Michael Saddona (sp?) ran the
Franklin National Bank as a huge gambling device and money
laundry. Result? The bank collapsed in 1974 and was taken over by
a group of European banks with the <span class="GPE" title="GPE">Vatican</span> losing *part* of their
grip.</p>
         <p>Saddona was sent to an American prison for fraudulent banking.
Later he was extradited to Italy on more charges. He began
talking too much. The Pope silenced him in an Italian jail --
*murdered* with a poisoned cup of coffee. (By the way, the same
method they used to murder Chicago mayor Harold Washington, a
poisoned cup of coffee, and replaced him with the <span class="GPE" title="GPE">Vatican</span>'s man
of trust, Richie Daley.)</p>
         <p>Saddona and his confederate successors also ran, for the Pope,
the Continental Bank of Chicago. All the <span class="NORP" title="NORP">Catholic</span> churches of the
Western Hemisphere run their money through that bank. After all,
the archbishop of Chicago is also the treasurer, for the Church,
for all of <span class="LOC" title="LOC">North America</span>, Central America and South America.</p>
         <p>In the early 1980s, Continental Bank, through their holding
company owed some $20 billion to the <span class="NORP" title="NORP">Japanese</span>, including their
mafia, the yakusa (sp?) who had put in slight capital.
Continental could not repay, so the <span class="NORP" title="NORP">Japanese</span> in May, 1984,
started a run on the bank and its holding company, Continental
Illinois. Result? A consortium of banks, headed by J.P. Morgan
and Company, took over -- with the Pope losing *part*, but not
all, of his control.</p>
         <p>The Morgan banks are the front for <span class="NORP" title="NORP">British</span> royalty and the Queen,
who for over 100 years always had a director sitting to supervise
Continental. Through Continental Bank, however, the <span class="GPE" title="GPE">Vatican</span>
continued to oversee Panama's General Noriega, and his joint,
secret business deals with George Bush. So, when the U.S. invaded
Panama, Noriega naturally sought refuge in the <span class="GPE" title="GPE">Vatican</span> Embassy
and branch of the <span class="GPE" title="GPE">Vatican</span> Bank. The U.S. military used
psychological warfare, including super hard-rock music to drive
him out.</p>
         <p>The Justice Department's record grabbers have descended on
Continental Bank, seeking to destroy incriminating records that
would put President Bush in the same jail cell with his <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>
business partner, General Noriega. By the way, Panama, under
General Noriega was the only country in the Western Hemisphere
run by a dark-skinned person. Noriega was popular with the bulk
of those *in* Panama, who are people of color. It was only the
small, white aristocracy *there* that wanted him removed. They
used the branches of worldwide banks there to skim off loot from
dope and gun running. Noriega was really just a small-time, semi-independent tyrant.</p>
         <p>Helping supervise Continental Bank has been the <span class="GPE" title="GPE">Vatican</span>'s man of
trust, Chicago federal appeals judge Walter Cummings (sp?), for
many years also chief judge and major stockholder of the bank.
Judge Cummings steers cases in his court to fellow banker/judges
-- which is most of them.</p>
         <p>For many years the major owners of Bank of America and their
holding company were the Jesuits and the <span class="GPE" title="GPE">Vatican</span>, and their long-time cronies, the Rothschilds (sp?). Like Continental Bank up
until 1984, they owed tens of billions of dollars to the <span class="NORP" title="NORP">Japanese</span>
and the yakusa, who own most of the other sizeable banks in
California. In the late 1980s, Bank of America was faced with a
run, so they have quietly given over most of the control to the
<span class="NORP" title="NORP">Japanese</span>.</p>
         <p>Although the Pope has lost much of the control of the three banks
in America, the pontiff continues as the major owner in nuclear
power utility firms, including Commonwealth Edison and Florida
Power.</p>
