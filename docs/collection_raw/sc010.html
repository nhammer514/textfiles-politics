         <p>Skolnick COMMENTARY #010
========================</p>
         <p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve
either all or portions of the following.]</p>
         <p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put
out by a group in Chicago called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>
         <p>Hi! Sherman Skolnick, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts,
9800 Oglesby.</p>
         <p>More about the <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> White House scandals.</p>
         <p>Some contend White House aide Vincent Foster, jr. committed
suicide *in* the White House and the body was removed and planted
in a park in Virginia. If so, whoever moved the body used the
opportunity to make it look like he was murdered. So the
President and his wife would be guilty of being accomplices to
murder by their coverup. [??] Others contend the body shows
Foster was apparently murdered and the body delivered to the park
and positioned so as to cast suspicion on the White House.</p>
         <p>Either way, <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> has stonewalled the matter and arranged to
hold back the release of the autopsy.</p>
         <p>Foster and Hillary were not only lovers but also law partners,
and worked on clandestine deals for the Bank of Criminals and
Conspirators International [BCCI] -- involving money-washing for
domestic and overseas political murders, gun-running, and dope-trafficking. Military <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> officers, posing as Justice Department
officials, have twisted matters around so as to finger Bill
<span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span>.</p>
         <p>But <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span>, after all, is no angel.</p>
         <p>The mass media have soft-pedalled reports that Hillary's law firm
has shredded records relating to the President and first lady's
daily financial business. Some in the press are also slanting
reports so as to blame Hillary alone, as if "Sludge Willy" is
himself innocent. *Oh, yeah?!*</p>
         <p>Left out of the press are key details:</p>
         <p>ITEM: Some $47 million is missing from the <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span>'s Arkansas
rotten dealings -- plundering an S&amp;L, funneling money through
real estate firms, and other money [unclear].</p>
         <p>ITEM: <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span>'s nominee for head of the firm the S&amp;L bailout
racket called "Resolution Trust Corporation" [RTC] wanted to
clean up S&amp;L corruption. *But*, he withdrew his name. S&amp;Ls in
Illinois, Texas, and Colorado have been plundered by <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>
operatives and left bankrupt.</p>
         <p>ITEM: The RTC in Chicago transferred some $50 million from a
little-known contingency fund here to Arkansas... the attempt
to cover up the Arkansas embezzlement done by the <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span>s and
their criminal gang.</p>
         <p>The fund was administered for RTC by Household Bank as part of
their merger with an S&amp;L in the Chicago area. The head of the
parent firm, Household International, an expert on financials,
was murdered in April '93. Household is a successor to Nugan-Hand(sp?) Bank, the worldwide <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> front headquartered in
Australia.</p>
         <p>ITEM: Federal judges in Chicago have "stood on their head" to try
to cover up the disappearance of the RTC fund here and the
transfer to Arkansas. ([Allegedly] including Chicago federal
district judge George Lindbergh, who heads a "lie box" company
with major clients <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>, National Security Agency, and off-shore
gambling casinos. Also, [allegedly] Chicago federal bankruptcy
judge John D. Schwartz.) It is referred to as "The Androcetti
Affair"(sp?).</p>
         <p>ITEM: Hillary Rodham <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> is facing indictment by a federal
grand jury in Little Rock for bank embezzlement and income tax
fraud.</p>
         <p>ITEM: Leading the attack on the <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> White House is Chicago
Congressman Henry Hyde, reportedly in charge of <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>'s bloody
"black budget" [CfD -- This would be money budgeted for <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>
"projects" by the Congress that for secrecy reasons does not
appear in public documents]. Hyde has more actual power than the
director of Central Intelligence to arrange political
assassinations, to launder secret funds, and to railroad enemies
into prison. Hyde has been director of a suburban S&amp;L here, now
defunct, fronting for <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span>. The federal court case of RTC against
Henry Hyde was ordered suppressed because of "national security."</p>
