         <p>Skolnick COMMENTARY #023
========================</p>
         <p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve
either all or portions of the following.]</p>
         <p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put
out by a group in Chicago called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>
         <p>Hi! Sherman Skolnick, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts
[CCCC], 9800 Oglesby.</p>
         <p>A big cover-up with congressman Dan Rostenkowski of Chicago,
arranged by the corrupt IRS, the Justice Department, and the
White House.</p>
         <p>
            <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span>, while Governor, supervised a <span class="ORG" title="ORG">CIA</span> operation in a forest
in western Arkansas called the Mena airport. It was used for dope
and gun smuggling on a mass scale. Implicated also were George
Bush as vice-President and <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Reagan</span> as President, and Ollie <span class="LOC" title="LOC">North</span>.</p>
         <p>Governor <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span> told the state law enforcement to "look the
other way." Used were several public and private funds, including
the Arkansas Development Finance Authority, Jackson Stephens and
his bond brokerage and banking empire. Also reportedly used: A
company called Park-O-Meter.</p>
         <p>The hundreds of millions of dollars per month from cocaine and
such was reportedly funneled through Garfield Ridge Trust and
Savings Bank of Chicago. The bank has been owned and operated by
congressman Rostenkowski and his cronies, who have commented on
the bank's reported criminality for some 20 years now.</p>
         <p>&gt;From the bank, the money was washed through the commodity,
currency, and options markets here: The Chicago Board of Trade,
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the Chicago Board Options
Exchange. (Traders on these markets have told us that they expect
a scandal. And the Chicago IRS "torpedoed" their own
investigation of this.)</p>
         <p>Over the years, "Rosty" (as the congressman has been called) has
received bribes of tens of thousands of dollars from these
markets. Some bribes they attempted to disguise as so-called
"lecture fees." Did "Rosty" ever give some of these speeches for
them, huh?</p>
         <p>As head of the tax writing committee of Congress, "Rosty" put
through laws so quietly they were considered private laws; making
the speculators here exempt from paying taxes on little-known
market devices such as "hedges" and "straddles." And, of course,
the crooked IRS in Chicago received part of the bribes to cover
this all up.</p>
         <p>"Rosty's" two daughters reportedly worked at the Board of Trade
(Oh yeah?) but were seldom seen there. They reportedly
facilitated the cocaine money laundering.</p>
         <p>"Rosty" was also one of the main culprits regarding the bribery
of Congress by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
[BCCI]. This criminal bank supposedly went under in 1991, *but*
it continues, however, as Chemical Bank Group -- successor to
First National Bank of Cicero, run by Paul Marcinkas, the
gangster who headed the <span class="GPE" title="GPE">Vatican</span> Bank.</p>
         <p>Using "cook books" for BCCI, the commodity, currency, and options
markets here bought 25% of Congress -- *including* congressman
Rostenkowski and Company.</p>
         <p>The crooked mastermind of "Rosty's" election campaign in 1994 has
been Jeremiah Joyce, a little-known business partner of Chicago
mayor Richie Daley. Joyce, and Daley, are the secret owners of
Glenrock Company, construction supplies. By the way, if you want
to be a state highway contractor, you'd better get your cement-pouring compounds from them! And, you'd better pay "kickbacks."
Glenrock Company reportedly does not keep proper records for the
IRS!</p>
         <p>"Rosty" is willing to "take the fall" on relatively minor charges
[in order] to continue the mass media cover-up of Mena airport,
cocaine and guns, his crooked bank, the big dealers in the
Chicago markets, and the corrupt tax collectors in the White
House and the Justice Department.</p>
         <p>(By the way, if he doesn't "stay shut," I suppose they'd shoot
him.)</p>
         <p>They'd need a very large jail cell for Rostenkowski, and his pal
Richie Daley, Bill and Hillary <span class="PERSON" title="PERSON">Clinton</span>, the head of the IRS in
Chicago, the U.S. attorney general, and the pilots on the markets
here!</p>
         <p>Just another story, suppressed by the liars and whores of the
press.</p>
