<conspiracyFile>LISTING OF YOUR U.S. HIGH LEVEL PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO SOLD YOU OUT TO FOREIGN
INTERESTS
There has been much talk recently about 'foreign agents'. These are very
high level Federal public servants and elected members you sent to
represent you, who go work in the U.S. Federal government for a short time,
make contacts in the government, then betray their country (and you) by
selling themselves out as agents to foreign interests. They do this in
order that they may personally get rich through the resulting 'blood money'
as they use their contacts they made while serving the public in order to
betray America. The amount of money involved is in the millions of
dollars PER AGENT!
This is a partial listing (A-H) of your high level federal public servants
who sold themselves (and the people they were supposed to represent and
protect) out to foreign interests after leaving their government jobs. Both
political parties are very well represented in this list (the entire list
(A-Z) consists of several hundred people).
Julia Christine Bliss tops the list with her $11106514 bribe by Toshiba
in order to sell out American industry and jobs to this giant Japanese
conglomerate.
My comments and how to get the rest of the list are at the end of this
file. I'd appreciate your comments on this post (by mail or by posting).
If what you see below disturbs you, you may want to do something about
it when you go vote for your next President and Congress in November.
If you don't do something about it by not voting, this problem will most
certainly get worse and you (and your kids in the future) will become
unemployed in the future as one of these people will sell your job away so
they can make some money.
Please think about it...
(Amounts are in U.S. Dollars. Fees and expenditure are paid via a 'front'
lobby firm whom the agent works through).

THE END
The entire list was too long to post on Internet, but a partial listing
gets the point across. If this bothers you, fax/email this file far and
wide and do something about it on election day. If you don't do your part
to take care of it, these people above will most certainly take care of
you.
If you want the complete listing, please send me a note and I'll get it
to you in the next week or so.
If there are any errors in this list, please forward them on to me.
