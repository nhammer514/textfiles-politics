<p><ent type='person'>Skolnick</ent> COMMENTARY #020
========================</p>

<p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve 
either all or portions of the following.]</p>

<p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put 
out by a group in Chicago called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up 
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>

<p>Hi! Sherman <ent type='person'>Skolnick</ent>, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts 
[CCCC], 9800 South Oglesby.</p>

<p>A key [unclear] in various worldwide schemes is the Chicago-based 
law firm, Hopkins &amp; Sutter.</p>

<p>The highly corrupt S&amp;L whitewash agency is the Resolution Trust 
Corporation (RTC). Guess where one of their main offices is? Why, 
inside the Chicago offices of Hopkins &amp; Sutter.</p>

<p>A Hopkins [&amp; Sutter] partner is <ent type='person'>Jay Steinberg</ent>. He was bankruptcy 
trustee in the strange case of <ent type='person'>William Stecker</ent>(sp?) and 
Grayville(?) Corporation. *Hundreds* of millions of dollars 
disappeared. <ent type='person'>Steinberg</ent> doesn't seem to know *where*.</p>

<p>Also complicit with <ent type='person'>Steinberg</ent> is a member of the Justice 
Department's murder squad, Mike "Chucky" <ent type='person'>Peters</ent>, a Chicago FBI 
agent with worldwide authority. In an undisputed, unpublicized 
federal case, <ent type='person'>Peters</ent> was accused of complicity in the murder of 
some *40* federal grand jury witnesses in the notorious Inslaw 
grand jury quiz.</p>

<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance has a evil stepsister -- namely, 
RTC. Hopkins &amp; Sutter, *and* RTC, arranged to have the rotten 
Rose Law Firm of Little Rock used to cover up massive plundering 
of assets of failing or already defunct savings &amp; loans in the 
Chicago area -- such as in the western suburbs here. Backed up by 
a host of details, it seems CIA clandestine operatives 
*plundered* these S&amp;Ls -- including Olympic S&amp;L and Clyde 
Savings.</p>

<p>The Rose Law Firm partner, <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Hillary</ent> Rodham <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent></ent>, played a role 
in *raping and plundering* one or more Chicago-area S&amp;Ls!</p>

<p>Hopkins &amp; Sutter, and RTC-Chicago, arranged in recent years to 
transfer some $50 million from an RTC contingency fund to Little 
Rock -- to help cover up the $47 million of federally insured 
funds missing in Arkansas.</p>

<p>A federal grand jury in Little Rock is considering criminal 
charges against the First Lady: massive bank embezzlement and 
income tax fraud.</p>

<p>The [RTC] funds were transferred from Chicago reportedly with the 
help of <ent type='person'>Jay Steinberg</ent> *and* with attorney <ent type='person'>John Gearham</ent>(sp?), who 
is of the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge -- same place <ent type='person'>Hillary</ent> is 
from. <ent type='person'>Gearham</ent> is "tight" with <ent type='person'>Hillary</ent>'s lawyer brother.</p>

<p>With the reported connivance of Hopkins &amp; Sutter, the RTC records 
are gone! Helping in the huge rip-off is Household International 
and their units, Household Bank -- an outgrowth of CIA's <ent type='person'>Nugan</ent>- 
Hand Bank, once headquartered in Australia.</p>

<p>Interwoven in all this is the strange murder of White House aide 
<ent type='person'>Vincent Foster</ent>, jr. Now, one of his secretaries has been a 
business partner of <ent type='person'>Dan Lassater</ent> -- tied to the savings &amp; loans 
through crooked bond dealings. After Foster's death, she 
reportedly swiped some of his records; and they're being used by 
Hopkins &amp; Sutter and other lawyers, clandestine operatives, 
murder squad members, and crooked federal judges here to 
blackmail the <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent> White House.</p>

<p>To "muddy the waters," they are spreading rumors... [laughs] 
possibly true [laughs]... that <ent type='person'>Hillary</ent> had her former lover and 
law partner, Foster -- now get this -- *murdered* by the Secret 
Service in the White House! Those who removed the body, however, 
planted it in a park in Virginia to cast suspicion on the White 
House.</p>

<p>And what can you do? Well, call up your local news-fakers and 
tell them to stop kidding us about what the <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent> scandal is 
all about, huh?</p>

<p>In Chicago, see us on cable tv, channel 21, 9 pm [cst] most 
Monday evenings.</p>

and the dope business; (312) 731-1505.</p>
