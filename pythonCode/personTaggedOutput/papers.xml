<p>  So here we go again!!!  Remember not to long ago when some one talked about
SS#'s and what a pain in the ass the establishment is for using them...
Well kids get ready for this!!!!  So, some of you still think you can move 
around uninhibited?  Let me tell you a tale, A tale of the true nature of the 
establishment. For all intensive purposes lets just call myself <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Joe</ent> <ent type='person'>Jones</ent></ent>.
I've lived in MA. all my life.(or for that matter, most of it..)</p>

<p>Are you ready kiddies... this is a tale of konspiracy by big bro... (if youve seen the 
movie "Brazil" youll see how all this shit happened...)</p>

Clerk: (2 state troopers next to him...) Yes sir do you have you're PAPERS..
<ent type='person'>ME</ent>: Yes I do, here they are. As I watched him type on his anallyretentive crt.</p>

<p>I saw a most disturbing, puzzling look on his face... a glance to the S.S.
men brought them over to his screen... (check this shit out!!!) I looked
at the little man and he got up from the counter and left. The KGB 
(Troopers) walked toward me... (I didnt like the looks of this..)</p>

<p>TROOPERS: "<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>JOE</ent>Y</ent> JONES WOULD YOU PLEASE PUT YOURE HANDS BEHIND YOURE BACK." </p>

police officer in the state of N.J...."
