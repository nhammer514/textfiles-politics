<p><ent type='person'>Skolnick</ent> COMMENTARY #012
========================</p>

<p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve 
either all or portions of the following.]</p>

<p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put 
out by a group in Chicago called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up 
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>

<p>Hi! Sherman <ent type='person'>Skolnick</ent>, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts, 
9800 South Oglesby.</p>

<p>The very rich and powerful are not given to moist-eyed emotion. 
They can hold a Christmas party, for example, for their devoted 
workers and smile on them. And then, a few days later, dismiss a 
bunch of them and tell their brutal security guards to throw the 
workers off the premises in one hour.</p>

<p>Fearing a labor dispute, the *Chicago Tribune* put attack dogs to 
terrorize the printing workers in the Trib's "Freedom Center." 
(With the smashing of the union, by the way, it's called "Slavery 
Center.")</p>

<p>Likewise so, when the ultra-rich deal with their mannequins, 
labelled "President of the United States." President Lincoln was 
assassinated a few days after the end of the Civil War. His post- 
war policy was to go easy on the South. So, agriculture would 
have resumed amid plummeting prices. The very rich, including the 
<ent type='person'>Rothschilds</ent>, had huge commodities speculations to the contrary. 
To some, bringing the South back [into the Union] was treason. 
So, they had Lincoln's brains blown out and blamed a "lone nut."</p>

<p>The ultra-rich and their top military and CIA hawks accused 
President <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> of treason in denying U.S. air cover at the 
aborted invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs; also, for <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> 
planning detente with the Soviets. Yet <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> was popular with the 
common people. Nevertheless, his brains were blown out in an open 
car with military-style triangulation firing. A "lone nut" was 
blamed, and himself murdered.</p>

<p>As you can see, the very rich are not sentimental.</p>

<p>The ultra rich (and again, with their trusted CIA and military 
retainers) accused President <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent> of treason in his dealings 
with North Vietnam. Also, he wanted to be an imperial president, 
blackmailing CIA with his knowledge of the CIA murdering <ent type='person'>JFK</ent>.</p>

<p>Blowing his brains out in an open car would be messy, so, ahead 
of the 1972 re-election of "Tricky Dick," CIA double-agents got 
themselves caught at the Watergate Hotel -- owned by the Pope.</p>

<p>All to finger <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>. (Some details are in the book *Silent Coup* 
by Colodny(sp?)).</p>

<p><ent type='person'>Nixon</ent> was so popular he won re-election in 49 of the 50 states. 
Yet, shortly thereafter began the Watergate bombardment. The 
press so ran after him he couldn't hold press conferences!</p>

<p>And, just at the height of *his* popularity, the press is 
mounting *their* "Whitewater-gate" blitz, against <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent>. Some 
of his schemes on health care endanger large insurance companies 
-- like Prudential, owned by the British royal family.</p>

<p>Funny thing: What the press trumpets of the rich are accusing 
<ent type='person'>Clinton</ent> are true enough.</p>

<p>Yes, he and his wife committed financial crimes in ripping off 
$47 million through Arkansas S&amp;L and others.</p>

<p>Yes, <ent type='person'>Bill</ent> and <ent type='person'>Hillary</ent>, to try to save themselves from prison, 
covered up the murder of White House aide <ent type='person'>Vincent <ent type='person'>Foster</ent></ent>.</p>

<p>And yes, the ultra rich contend privately that <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent> committed 
treason in aborting a *genuine* CIA plot to murder Iraqi 
strongman <ent type='person'>Saddam Hussein</ent>, a sworn enemy of the United States, on 
July 17, 1993. And two days later, <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent> chopping off the head 
of FBI director Sessions because he was investigating <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent>'s 
"treason." And on July 20, <ent type='person'>Foster</ent> was murdered just as he was 
planning to plead with <ent type='person'>Bill</ent> to leave the plot go forward for 
"national security" reasons, or be impeached.</p>

<p>The ultra rich consider most Americans stupid and [that they] 
have to be told fairy tales; to be amused with stories of an 
angry wife cutting off her husbands "ding-a-ling."</p>

<p>So, will <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent> be put to the wall at the height of his 
popularity? Remember: The ultra rich are not sentimental.</p>

<p>(312) 731-1100 is our main message. Donations will be 
appreciated...</p>
