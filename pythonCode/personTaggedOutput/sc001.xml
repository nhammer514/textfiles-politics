<ent type='person'>Skolnick</ent> COMMENTARY #001
========================</p>

<p>Hi. Sherman Skolnik, Citizen's Committee to Clean Up the Courts, 
9800 Oglesby.</p>

<p>At one time the <ent type='person'>Pope</ent> owned three major banks in America: New 
York, Chicago and San Francisco.</p>

<p>In New York, St. Peter's banker, Michael <ent type='person'>Saddona</ent> (sp?) ran the 
Franklin National Bank as a huge gambling device and money 
laundry. Result? The bank collapsed in 1974 and was taken over by 
a group of European banks with the Vatican losing *part* of their 
grip.</p>

<p><ent type='person'>Saddona</ent> was sent to an American prison for fraudulent banking. 
Later he was extradited to Italy on more charges. He began 
talking too much. The <ent type='person'>Pope</ent> silenced him in an Italian jail -- 
*murdered* with a poisoned cup of coffee. (By the way, the same 
method they used to murder Chicago mayor <ent type='person'>Harold Washington</ent>, a 
poisoned cup of coffee, and replaced him with the Vatican's man 
of trust, Richie Daley.)</p>

<p><ent type='person'>Saddona</ent> and his confederate successors also ran, for the <ent type='person'>Pope</ent>, 
the Continental Bank of Chicago. All the Catholic churches of the 
Western Hemisphere run their money through that bank. After all, 
the archbishop of Chicago is also the treasurer, for the Church, 
for all of North America, Central America and South America.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s, Continental Bank, through their holding 
company owed some $20 billion to the Japanese, including their 
mafia, the yakusa (sp?) who had put in slight capital. 
Continental could not repay, so the Japanese in May, 1984, 
started a run on the bank and its holding company, Continental 
Illinois. Result? A consortium of banks, headed by J.P. <ent type='person'>Morgan</ent> 
and Company, took over -- with the <ent type='person'>Pope</ent> losing *part*, but not 
all, of his control.</p>

<p>The <ent type='person'>Morgan</ent> banks are the front for British royalty and the <ent type='person'>Queen</ent>, 
who for over 100 years always had a director sitting to supervise 
Continental. Through Continental Bank, however, the Vatican 
continued to oversee Panama's General <ent type='person'>Noriega</ent>, and his joint, 
secret business deals with <ent type='person'>George <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>. So, when the U.S. invaded 
Panama, <ent type='person'>Noriega</ent> naturally sought refuge in the Vatican Embassy 
and branch of the Vatican Bank. The U.S. military used 
psychological warfare, including super hard-rock music to drive 
him out.</p>

<p>The Justice Department's record grabbers have descended on 
Continental Bank, seeking to destroy incriminating records that 
would put President <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> in the same jail cell with his CIA 
business partner, General <ent type='person'>Noriega</ent>. By the way, Panama, under 
General <ent type='person'>Noriega</ent> was the only country in the Western Hemisphere 
run by a dark-skinned person. <ent type='person'>Noriega</ent> was popular with the bulk 
of those *in* Panama, who are people of color. It was only the 
small, white aristocracy *there* that wanted him removed. They 
used the branches of worldwide banks there to skim off loot from 
dope and gun running. <ent type='person'>Noriega</ent> was really just a small-time, semi- 
independent tyrant.</p>

<p>Helping supervise Continental Bank has been the Vatican's man of 
trust, Chicago federal appeals judge Walter <ent type='person'>Cummings</ent> (sp?), for 
many years also chief judge and major stockholder of the bank. 
Judge <ent type='person'>Cummings</ent> steers cases in his court to fellow banker/judges 
-- which is most of them.</p>

<p>For many years the major owners of Bank of America and their 
holding company were the Jesuits and the Vatican, and their long- 
time cronies, the <ent type='person'>Rothschilds</ent> (sp?). Like Continental Bank up 
until 1984, they owed tens of billions of dollars to the Japanese 
and the yakusa, who own most of the other sizeable banks in 
California. In the late 1980s, Bank of America was faced with a 
run, so they have quietly given over most of the control to the 
Japanese.</p>

<p>Although the <ent type='person'>Pope</ent> has lost much of the control of the three banks 
in America, the pontiff continues as the major owner in nuclear 
power utility firms, including Commonwealth Edison and Florida 
Power.</p>
