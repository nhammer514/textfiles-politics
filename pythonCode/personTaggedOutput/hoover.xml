<p> Summary:  The second half of this post includes the copy of a memorandum 
   written by J. <ent type='person'>Edgar Hoover</ent> immediately after he met w/LBJ in 
   the Oval Office seven days after President <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> had been 
   murdered.  The first half analyzes some of the more remarkable 
   details of this memo.</p>

<p>  In 1963, <ent type='person'>John</ent> <ent type='person'>Edgar Hoover</ent> and <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Lyndon</ent> Baines <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent></ent> knew each other 
  very well.  They had lived across the street from each other for the 
  past 19 years.  A professional bureaucrat of formidable talents, a 29-
  year-old <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> was appointed director of the Bureau of Investigation 
  in 1924 (<ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> added "Federal" to the title in 1935) by then Attorney 
  General <ent type='person'>Harlan</ent> F. Stone to clean up a corrupt organization.  During 
  WWII, President <ent type='person'>Roosevelt</ent> expanded the FBI's reach charging <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> with 
  investigations of Nazi and Communist activities in the U.S.  The Cold 
  War gave the Bureau new power and <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> new glory.  <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent>'s dossiers 
  continued to grow as well as his command of Congress, his manipulation 
  and intimidation of the press, and his stature in the country.  <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> 
  supplied Joe McCarthy with a great deal of the ammunition which enabled 
  McCarthy to sustain his "crusade" far longer than would have been 
  possible without <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent>'s connivance.  
  
  When Robert <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> became Attorney General in 1961, <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent>'s 
  entrenched power-structures suffered a two-year, 10-month setback.  
  Long before 1961, <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> had created a direct channel of communication 
  with whoever was the current occupant of the Oval Office--bypassing the
  actual chain of command which went from the President, through the 
  Attorney General, to Director of the FBI.  </p>

<p>  When LBJ assumed the Presidency, <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent>'s direct link into the White
  House was re-established.  <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent>'s official relationship with <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent>
  was enhanced by personal friendship as well.  "As majority leader [in
  the Senate], <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> already had <ent type='person'>neen</ent> receiving a steady stream of
  reports and dossiers from the Director . . . which he prized both as
  a means of controlling difficult senators and as a gratification of
  earthier instincts.  For President <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent>, secrets were in themselves
  perquisites of power . . .  No chief executive praised the Director so
  warmly.  In an executive order exempting <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent>, then sixty nine, from
  compulsory retirement at seventy, <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> hailed him as `a quiet,
  humble and magnificent public servant . . . a hero to millions of
  citizens and an anathema to all evil men. . . .  The nation cannot
  afford to lose you . . .  No other American, now or in our past, has
  served the cause of justice so faithfully and so well' ("<ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> Hails 
  <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> Service, Waives Compulsory Retirement," NYT, May 9, 1964)."
  -- from "The Age of Surveillance, The Aims and Methods of America's
   Political Intelligence System," by <ent type='person'>Frank Donner</ent>, (c) 1980, Knopf.</p>

<p>  The following memorandum, written by <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> immediately after his 
  meeting with President <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent>, just seven days after the assassination
  of President <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent>, is a remarkable document to say the least.  There
  is much information imparted in the memo regarding just how fluid and
  unstable the cover story about who killed <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> still was shaping up to be 
  at that time.  By analyzing the discrepancies between the story <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> 
  briefed <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> about on November 29th, and what the final cover story 
  handed down by the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission would claim almost a year later, 
  we can better appreciate the degree to which the final "official report" 
  was sculpted to fit the constraints the Commission was forced to adhere 
  to, regardless of the actual facts of the assassination.</p>

<p>  This document is what is known in bureaucracy-speak as a "memo for the
  record."  It was a customary practice in the upper levels of the 
  bureaucracy in the days before electronic technology in Washington, D.C.
  An official of high rank would usually return to her or his office
  after such a meeting and dictate a memorandum of as many details of the
  discussion as could be remembered.  It was a way of recording one's own
  professional dealings for future reference.</p>

<p>  <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> starts out recounting that <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> brings up "the proposed group"
  --what will become the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission--to study the report <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> is 
  trying to complete by the end of the same day.  This has been initiated 
  by <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> to prevent an independent investigation by Congress of the 
  assassination (<ent type='person'>Reagan</ent> tried to do the same thing with the Tower 
  Commission).  <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> would publically announce the creation of the 
  <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission later that same day.  This was a critical move by 
  <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent>:  by appointing the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission, they effectively bottled 
  up Bobby <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent>, they bottled up the Senate, and they bottled up Texas. 
  The Tower Commission didn't succeed in pre-empting an investigation by
  Congress.  In the end, the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission didn't either, but it did 
  keep the cork in place, preventing any other "official" examination, for
  well over another decade.</p>

<p>  It is interesting to note that of all the people listed at the bottom of
  page one, retired General <ent type='person'>Lauris Norstad</ent> (who had been head of the NATO
  forces at SHAPE headquarters in Europe before his retirement) was the 
  only one who somehow succeeded in not serving on this Presidential 
  Commission.  <ent type='person'>Earl Warren</ent> did NOT want the job and had sent a memo ahead 
  to the Oval Office, before he answered LBJ's summons, stating he would 
  not participate in such a commission.  But when push came to shove, 
  <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent>'s formidable powers of persuasion turned <ent type='person'>Warren</ent>'s `no' into a 
  `yes.'  Apparently, even such focused persuasion could not win Norstad's 
  agreement.</p>

<p>  The six topic bullets at the bottom of page one are file listings.  This
  is important for anyone ever finding themself searching for documents
  from the government through Freedom Of Information Act requests.  This
  type of listing is very useful beccause it lets one know that these
  files exist, and that one might be able to find documents using this
  method which one might not find (or even know about) any other way.</p>

<p>  In the middle of the first paragraph on page 3, <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> relates how the
  Dallas police didn't even make a move to stop Ruby.  This is a pretty
  heavy line by <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent>.  He implies the Dallas cops must have somehow 
  been in collusion to silence <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> from living to stand trial.  But
  the implication is never fleshed out.</p>

<p>  The second half of page three contains some of the most enlightening
  statements of the whole memo.  <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> tells <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> three shots were
  fired.  <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> asks "if any were fired at him."  This question goes
  a long way towards explaining the duress under which he served as
  president.  LBJ had heard bullets flying overhead--he had been that 
  close to the action.  It was completely out of keeping with the 
  standard security procedures the Secret Service employed to have any 
  such parade appearance be attended by *both* the president and the 
  vice president.  <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> heard the sounds of those guns very clearly 
  and the message they conveyed.  He lived out the rest of his public 
  life always aware of their possible return.  Not long before he died, 
  LBJ was interviewed by his friend and writer <ent type='person'>Leo Janos</ent>.  In the July, 
  1973 issue of "The Atlantic Monthly," Janos relates that LBJ told him:</p>

<p>  1. "that the assassination in Dallas had been part of a conspiracy;
  2. "I never believed that <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> acted alone . . .;
  3. "we had been operating a damned Murder Inc. in the Carribean."</p>

<p>  The presence of the vice president 2 cars behind the president in the 
  parade in Dallas was a fundamental breach of the level of security 
  normally adhered to by the Secret Service.  He took the experience back 
  with him to the White House and never forgot its meaning.  He could 
  just as easily be snuffed out if he ever got out of line.</p>

<p>  Then there follows a most curious and confused explanation by <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> of
  the three shots fired:  "the President was hit by the first and third 
  bullets and the second hit the Governor".  Obviously <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> did not yet
  know about the injury suffered by <ent type='person'>James Tague</ent>.  Tague's face was nicked 
  by a bullet fragment (or a fragment from the curb it hit) which missed 
  the limousene entirely and struck the curb at his feet, approximately 
  160 feet past the location of the president's car.  This shot would end
  up having to be one of "the three bullets fired" in the official story.</p>

<p>  <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> then explicitly asks again "were they aimed at the President."
  It would appear that LBJ needed repeated assurance by <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> that no one 
  had intended to shoot him.  <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> then says a mouthful when he states
  "I further advised him that we have also tested the fact you could fire 
  those three shots in three seconds."  Apparently they did not yet 
  understand the implications of the Zapruder film (or perhaps they were
  confident they would be successful in never allowing the public to gain 
  any kind of access to it) and that it would be used as a clock.  
  
  Probably the most confused statements <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> recounts making are when
  he describes for <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent>'s benefit how <ent type='person'>Connally</ent> was hit:  "I explained 
  that <ent type='person'>Connally</ent> turned to the President when the first shot was fired and 
  in that turning he got hit.  The President then asked, if <ent type='person'>Connally</ent> had 
  not been in his seat, would the President have been hit by the second 
  shot.  I said yes."  All we can conclude about this muddled explanation
  is that <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> was doing his best to explain things that he himself did
  not understand or appreciate the complexity of.</p>

<p>  <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> goes on to claim they found the gun and three shells on the fifth
  floor.  As you can see at this point, the number of variations on what 
  would become the official cover story are quite numerous.  All of the
  the facts of the assassination were working against them.  They had
  a story all worked out--3 seconds, 3 shots, fifth floor--and yet they 
  didn't know the facts.</p>

<p>  <ent type='person'>Fletcher Prouty</ent> commented on this issue to me while we were discussing
  this memo recently.  "It reminds me so much of when the U-2 was lost and
  the guys from NASA began to explain the U-2 flight until a couple of 
  days later when somebody told them, `hey--it wasn't a NASA flight, we
  can't do it that way.'  And they began to change the cover story.  But
  then Kruschev said, `Look, I've got the pilot, I know the story.'  The
  U-2 boys used to work across the hall from me--I'd see them coming and
  going--oh they were shattered, because their cover story had been 
  totally wrong.  So <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> is in the same kind of a box here--he is 
  trying to explain something that is nothing but a cover story, and 
  almost everytime he turns around, he finds there's another hole in it."</p>

<p>  Near the end <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> extolls the virtues of his relationship to <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent>
  stating "I was more than head of the FBI - I was his brother and personal 
  friend;  that he knew I did not want anything to happen to his family;  
  that he has more confidence in me than anybody in town."  Pretty 
  laudatory words which substantiate the unusally close rapport these two
  men had.  Then <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> writes that <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> tells him "he would not embroil 
  me in a jurisdictional dispute. . . "  This was the reference to Bobby 
  <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> and the pre-empting of any other legitimate, independent and
  official investigation that would NOT be under the control of the FBI.
  They would see to it that there would not be the kind of "rash of 
  investigations" <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> said at the beginning of this meeting "would be a
  three-ring circus."
  
  It is a known fact that in his later years <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent>'s meglomania 
  approached epic proportions.  He had various reasons why he did not want
  any independent investigation which would *not* be dependent upon his 
  agency for the collection of data and use of his investigative staff.
  <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> was feeling quite vulnerable in these first days and was 
  very dependent on <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent> to tell him what to do concerning how to
  consolidate his position and "reassure" the nation the assassination
  was not political in any way, but rather the random occurence of a lone
  sick mind.  That was the only approach to take if they wanted to avoid
  having to deal with why <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> had been killed.  By de-politicizing
  the assassination, they were able to ignore the basic question of why.</p>

<p>  This memorandum shows that the people in the federal government who were
  responsible for creating the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission, and giving it only a 
  very selected and specific set of "data" by which they reached the 
  conclusions that became the official report, that they did not start 
  with the final cover story--they created it later because even <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent>
  and <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> didn't know about it a week after the event.  They were still
  making things up a week later.  It goes back to the old truth that it's a
  big mistake to overestimate the abilities and knowledge of people--even 
  in high office.  They can make pretty stupid mistakes and then when they
  have to recant their stories, you are left with the kind of contrivance
  we know as the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Report.</p>

<p>   MEMORANDUM FOR MR. TOLSON
    MR. BELMONT
    MR. MOHR
    MR. CONRAD
    MR. DE LOACH
    MR. EVANS
    MR. ROSEN
    MR. SULLIVAN</p>

<p>  The President called and asked if I am familiar with the proposed
   group they are trying to get to study my report - two from the House,
   two from the Senate, two from the courts, and a couple of outsiders.  I
   replied that I had not heard of that but had seen reports from the
   Senate Investigating Committee.</p>

<p>  The President stated he wanted to get by just with my file and my
   report.  I told him I thought it would be very bad to have a rash of
   investigations.  He then indicated the only way to stop it is to
   appoint a high-level committee to evaluate my report and tell the House
   and Senate not to go ahead with the investigation.  I stated that would
   be a three-ring circus.</p>

<p>  The President then asked what I think about <ent type='person'>Allen Dulles</ent>, and I
   replied that he is a good man.  He then asked about <ent type='person'>John</ent> McCloy, and I
   stated I am not as enthusiastic about McCloy, that he is a good man but
   I am not so certain as to the matter of publicity he might want.  The
   President then mentioned General (Lauris) Norstad, and I said he is a
   good man.  He said in the House he might try (Hale) Boggs and (Gerald
   R.) Ford and in the Senate (Richard B.) <ent type='person'>Russell</ent> and (<ent type='person'>John Sherman</ent>)
   <ent type='person'>Cooper</ent>.  I asked him about <ent type='person'>Cooper</ent> and he indicated <ent type='person'>Cooper</ent> of Kentucky
   whom he described as a judicial man, stating he would not want (Jacob
   K.) Javits.  I agreed on this point.  He then reiterated Ford of
   Michigan, and I indicated I know of him but do not know him and had
   never seen him except on television the other day and that he handled
   himself well on television.  I indicated that I do know Boggs.</p>

<p>  Memorandum for Messrs. Tolson, Belmont, Mohr, November 29, 1963
   Conrad, DeLoach, Evans, Rosen, Sullivan</p>

<p>  The President then mentioned that (Walter) Jenkins had told him that
  I have designated Mr. DeLoach to work with them as he had on the Hill.
  He indicated they appreciated that and just wanted to tell me they
  consider Mr. DeLoach as high class as I do, and that they salute me for
  knowing how to pick good men.</p>

<p>  I advised the President that we hope to have the investigation
  wrapped up today but probably won't have it before the first of the week
  as an angle in Mexico is giving trouble - the matter of <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent>'s getting
  $6500 from the Cuban Embassy and coming back to this country with it;
  that we are not able to prove that fact;  that we have information he
  was there on September 18 and we are able to prove he was in New Orleans
  on that date;  that a story came in changing the date to September 28
  and he was in Mexico on the 28th.  I related that the police have again
  arrested <ent type='person'>Duran</ent>, a member of the Cuban Embassy;  that they will hold her
  two or three days;  will confront her with the original informant;  and
  will also try a lie detector test on her.</p>

<p>  The President then inquired if I pay any attention to the lie
  detector test.  I answered that I would not pay 100% attention to them;
  that it was only a psychological asset in investigation;  that I would
  not want to be a part of sending a man to the chair on a lie detector
  test.  I explained that we have used them in bank investigations and a
  person will confess before the lie detector test is finished, more or
  less fearful it will show him guilty.  I said the lie detector test has
  this psychological advantage.  I further stated that it is a misnomer to
  call it a lie detector since the evaluation of the chart made by the
  machine is made by a human being and any human being is apt to make the
  wrong interpretation.</p>

<p>  I stated, if <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> had lived and had take a lie detector test, this
  with the evidence we have would have added that much strength to the
  case;  that these is no question he is the man.</p>

<p>  I also told him that <ent type='person'>Rubenstein</ent> down there has offered to take a lie
  detector test but his lawyer must be consulted first;  that I doubt the
  lawyer will allow him to do so;  that he has a West Coast lawyer
  somewhat like the <ent type='person'>Edward Bennett Williams</ent> type and almost as much of a
  shyster.</p>

<p>  The President asked if we have any relationship between the two 
  (<ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> and <ent type='person'>Rubenstein</ent>) as yet.  I replied that at the present time we have</p>

<div>.</div>

<p>  Memorandum for Messrs. Tolson, Belmont, Mohr, November 29, 1963
   Conrad, DeLoach, Evans, Rosen, Sullivan</p>

<p>  not;  that there was a story that the fellow had been in <ent type='person'>Rubenstein</ent>'s
  nightclub but it has not been confirmed.  I told the President that
  <ent type='person'>Rubenstein</ent> is a very seedy character, had a bad record - street brawls,
  fights, etc.;  that in Dallas, if a fellow came into his nightclub and
  could not pay his bill completely, <ent type='person'>Rubenstein</ent> would beat him up and
  throw him out;  that he did not drink or smoke;  that he was an
  egomaniac;  that he likes to be in the limelight;  knew all of the
  police officers in the white light district;  let them come in and get
  food and liquor, etc.;  and that is how I think he got into police
  headquarters.  I said if they ever made any move, the pictures did not
  show it even when they saw him approach and he got right up to <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent>
  and pressed the pistol against <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent>'s stomach;  that neither officer
  on either side made any effort to grab <ent type='person'>Rubenstein</ent> - not until after the
  pistol was fired.  I said, secondly, the chief of police admits he moved
  <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> in the morning as a convenience and at the request of motion
  picture people who wanted daylight.  I said insofar as tying <ent type='person'>Rubenstein</ent>
  and <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> together, we have not yet done so;  that there are a number
  of stories which tied <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> to the Civil Liberties Union in New York in
  which he applied for membership and to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee
  which is pro-<ent type='person'>Castro</ent>, directed by communists, and financed to some extent
  by the <ent type='person'>Castro</ent> Government.</p>

<p>  The President asked how many shots were fired, and I told him three.
  He then asked if any were fired at him.  I said no, that three shots
  were fired at the President and we have them.  I stated that our
  ballistic experts were able to prove the shots were fired by this gun;
  that the President was hit by the first and third bullets and the second
  hit the Governor;  that there were three shots;  that one complete
  bullet rolled out of the President's head;  that it tore a large part of
  the President's head off;  that in trying to massage his heart on the
  way into the hospital they loosened the bullet which fell on the
  stretcher and we have that.</p>

<p>  He then asked were they aimed at the President.  I replied they were
  aimed at the President, no question about that.</p>

<p>  I further advised him that we have also tested the fact you could
  fire those three shots in three seconds.  I explained that there is a
  story out that there must have been more than one man to fire several
  shots but we have proven it could be done by one man.</p>

<p>  The President then asked how it happened that <ent type='person'>Connally</ent> was hit.  I
  explained that <ent type='person'>Connally</ent> turned to the President when the first shot was
  fired and in that turning he got hit.  The President then asked, if
  <ent type='person'>Connally</ent> had not been in his seat, would the President have been hit by
  the second shot.  I said yes.</p>

<p>   - 3 -</p>

<div>.</div>

<p>  Memorandum for Messrs. Tolson, Belmont, Mohr, November 29, 1963
   Conrad, DeLoach, Evans, Rosen, Sullivan</p>

<p>  I related that on the fifth floor of the building where we found the
  gun and the wrapping paper we found three empty shells that had been
  fired and one that had not been fired.  that he had four but didn't fire
  the fourth;  then threw the gun aside;  went down the steps;  was seen
  by a police officer;  the manager told the officer that <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> was all
  right, worked there;  they let him go;  he got on a bus;  went to his
  home and got a jacket;  then came back downtown, walking;  the police
  officer who was killed stopped him, not knowing who he was;  and he
  fired and killed the police officer.</p>

<p>  The President asked if we can prove that and I answered yes.</p>

<p>  I further related that <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> then walked another two blocks;  went
  to the theater;  the woman selling tickets was so suspicious - said he
  was carrying a gun when he went into the theater - that she notified the
  police;  the police and our man went in and located <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent>.  I told him
  they had quite a struggle with <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> but that he was subdued and shown
  out and taken to police headquarters.</p>

<p>  I advised the President that apparently <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> had come down the
  steps from the fifth floor;  that apparently the elevator was not used.</p>

<p>  The President then indicated our conclusions are:  (1) he is the one
  who did it;  (2) after the President was hit, Governor <ent type='person'>Connally</ent> was hit;
  (3) the President would have been hit three times except for the fact
  that Governor <ent type='person'>Connally</ent> turned after the first shot and was hit by the
  second;  (4) whether he was connected with the Cuban operation with
  money we are trying to nail down.  I told him that is what we are trying
  to nail down;  that we have copies of the correspondence;  that none of
  the letters dealt with any indication of violence or assassination;
  that they were dealing with a visa to go back to Russia.</p>

<p>  I advised the President that his wife had been very hostile, would
  not cooperate and speaks only Russian;  that yesterday she said , if we
  could give assurance she would be allowed to remain in the country, she
  would cooperate;  and that I told our agents to give that assurance and
  sent a Russian-speaking agent to Dallas last night to interview her.  I
  said I do not know whether or not she has any information but we would
  learn what we could.</p>

<p>  The President asked how <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> had access to the fifth floor of the
  building.  I replied that he had access to all floors.  The President 
  asked where was his office and I stated he did not have any particular 
  place;  that he</p>

<p>  Memorandum for Messrs. Tolson, Belmont, Mohr, November 29, 1963
   Conrad, DeLoach, Evans, Rosen, Sullivan</p>

<p>  was not situated in any particular place;  that he was just a general
  packer of requisitions that came in for books from Dallas schools;  that
  he would have had proper access to the fifth and sixth floors whereas
  usually the employees were down on lower floors.  The President then
  inquired if anybody saw him on the fifth floor, and I stated he was seen
  by one of the workmen before the assassination.</p>

<p>  The President then asked if we got a picture taken of him shooting
  the gun and I said no.  He asked what was the picture sold for $25000,
  and I advised him this was a picture of the parade showing Mrs. <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent>
  crawling out of the back seat;  that there was no Secret Service Agent
  on the back of the car;  that in the past they have added steps on the
  back of the car and usually had an agent on either side standing on the
  bumper;  that I did not know why this was not done - that the President
  may have requested it;  that the bubble top was not up but I understand
  the bubble top was not worth anything because it was made entirely of
  plastic;  that I had learned much to my surprise that the Secret Service
  does not have any armored cars.</p>

<p>  The President asked if I have a bulletproof car and I told him I
  most certainly have.  I told him we use it here for my own use and,
  whenever we have any raids, we make use of the bulletproof car on them.
  I explained that it is a limousine which has been armorplated and that
  it looks exactly like any other car.  I stated I think the President
  ought to have a bulletproof car;  that from all I understand the Secret
  Service has had two cars with metal plates underneath the car to take
  care of hand grenades or bombs thrown out on the street.  I said this is
  European;  that there have been several such attempts on DeGaulle's
  life;  but they do not do that in this country;  that all assassinations
  have been with guns;  and for that reason I think very definitely the
  President ought to always ride in a bulletproof car;  that it certainly
  would prevent anything like this ever happening again;  but that I do
  not mean a sniper could not snipe him from a window if he were exposed.</p>

<p>  The President asked if I meant on his ranch he should be in a
  bulletproof car.  I said I would think so;  that the little car we rode
  around in when I was at the ranch should be bulletproofed;  that it
  ought to be done very quietly.  I told him we have four bulletproof cars
  in the Bureau:  one on the West Coast, one in New York and two here.  I
  said this could be done quietly without publicity and without pictures
  taken of it if handled properly and I think he should have one on his
  ranch.</p>

<p>  Memorandum for Messrs. Tolson, Belmont, Mohr, November 29, 1963
   Conrad, DeLoach, Evans, Rosen, Sullivan</p>

<p>  The President then asked if I think all the entrances should be
  guarded.  I replied by all means, that he had almost to be in the
  capacity of a so-called prisoner because without that security anything
  could be done.  I told him lots of phone calls had been received over
  the last four or five days about threats on his life;  that I talked to
  the Attorney General about the funeral procession from the White House
  to the <ent type='person'>Cathedral</ent>;  that I was opposed to it.  The President remarked
  that the Secret Service told them not to but the family wanted to do it.
  I stated that was what the Attorney General told me but I was very much
  opposed to it.  I further related that I saw the procession from the
  Capitol to the White House on Pennsylvania and, while they had police
  standing on the curbs, when the parade came, the police turned around
  and looked at the parade.</p>

<p>  The President then stated he is going to take every precaution he
  can;  that he wants to talk to me;  and asked if I would put down my
  thoughts.  He stated I was more than head of the FBI - I was his brother
  and personal friend;  that he knew I did not want anything to happen to
  his family;  that he has more confidence in me than anybody in town;
  that he would not embroil me in a jurisdictional dispute;  but that he
  did want to have my thoughts on the matter to advocate as his own
  opinion.</p>

<p>  I stated I would be glad to do this for him and that I would do
  anything I can.  The President expressed his appreciation.</p>

<p>     Very truly yours,</p>
