<p>    AIDS as a Weapon of War</p>

<p>   by Dr. <ent type='person'>William Campbell Douglas</ent>, M.D.</p>

<p>   Introduction &amp; Comments by Jim Shults</p>

<p>   INTRODUCTION AND COMMENTS</p>

<p>    I must  admit  I  am  just  a  little  gun  shy  of  doing this
 particular article.  The reason is  pretty  obvious.  Who in hell is
 going to plead guilty to inventing the AIDS virus. Do  I  think it
 was invented?  Absolutely and without a doubt.</p>

<p>    Firstly, where in hell has it been during the last 5000 years?
 Why haven't we had exposure to it sooner, like in the last 50 years?</p>

<p>    All of  a  sudden  certain  countries and entire continents are
 coming down with the AIDS virus and no organization, body, group, or
 whatever you care to call it has even a clue to the real source, and
 it sure as hell isn't some monkey in Africa, that's for sure.</p>

<p>    Over the last twenty years the  genetic  scientists  have  been
 having a filed  day  inventing all kinds of new "life." Some  have
 even been granted  patents  for  their  creatures, which are usually
 various types of bacteria, etc.</p>

<p>    One patent was granted for the  invention,  or  more accurately
 put, creation, of a type of bacteria that eats oil,  handy  for  oil
 spills I guess. Now  do  you  think for even a second that a virus
 like the AIDS  virus  couldn't  be  created  with  all  the  genetic
 engineering that is going on around the world?</p>

<p>    There are  certain types of bacteria that are  living  in  test
 tubes in labs  around the world that if released would cause the end
 of mankind in less than a year.</p>

<p>    The real question is why we allow these bozos to play in labs,
 making all kinds of new and artificial  life in the first place.  It
 is going to  backfire,  in  fact the author already  feels  it  has,
 through the deliberate  release  of  the HIV (human immunodeficiency
 virus); that's what AIDS is really called.</p>

<p>    Something extraordinary happened  last  June  (88'), in fact it
 was so extraordinary that nothing like it has ever happened before.</p>

<p>    The Surgeon General of the United States had mailed to every
 mail box and address in the United States a brochure  attempting  to
 explain AIDS, its danger, myths and means of transmission.  The</p>

<p>    Page 1</p>

<p> absolutely amazing thing about this was that it was done at
 all.
    Think of  this  for  a minute:  the U.S. Government mailed this
 information to every address in America.  That in itself should tell
 all of us something that the media  has  somehow missed -- that this
 is a population-destroying virus.</p>

<p>    That really means that we all are in shit city,  race fans, and
 the Government know  it. It  is  significant  that  they  did  the
 mailing, and that should be very significant to anyone who knows
 how our government works and what kind of very real panic those
 who really know are experiencing.</p>

<p>    When something like this brochure  is made available as it was,
 you can be  very  sure  that  the  boys  at the top,  including  the
 scientific folks, are  up against something they may not beat before
 it has a very real chance of destroying at least half of mankind!</p>

<p>    In fact, the fastest time even  guessed  at,  for  some kind of
 beginning cure for  some types of AIDS is at least  five  years  and
 that's thought to be impossible by medical people.</p>

<p>    The author comes up with a very plausible scenario for how
 rapidly AIDS has been distributed.  (We are not blaming the
 World Health Organization.  In the author's scenario he simply
 indicates that the WHO was used by others.)</p>

<p>    Let's face  it, we are in very real trouble.  There are several
 types of new AIDS viruses and more  to  be discovered, and who is to
 say how the  new  ones,  not yet mutated, will spread  --  a  sneeze
 perhaps?</p>

<p>    Our government  and  others around the world are not telling us
 the truth about this stuff in order  to protect our poor little dumb
 minds.  I suspect  that  if  we know the truth, an enormous  citizen
 effort could be  martialed  worldwide which would probably shut down
 the arms race for the time being.</p>

<p>    Again, at the bottom line, we  are  in  big  trouble and "they"
 know it....Many scientists  predict  we will lose half  the  world's
 population (including U.S.) by the year 2000.</p>

<p>    AIDS as a Weapon of War</p>

<p>    <ent type='person'>William Campbell Douglas</ent>s, M.D.</p>

<p>    The great  powers  renounced chemical and biological warfare 20
 years ago --  but  kept right on experimenting. The  germ  warfare
 experiments on Seventh Day Adventist soldiers,</p>

<p>    1)  the Tuskeegee syphilis experiments on prisoners,
    2)  the  San  Francisco  Bay  attack  by  the U.S.  Army  using
    serratia marcescens bacteria,
    3)  the New York City subway germ attack
    4 and  many  other  experiments on humans, largely unknown to
    the victims, continue in the free world.</p>

<p>    In Novosybirsk, at the Ivanofsky Institute and other Soviet
 centers of biological  warfare, you can  be  sure  that  similar
 diabolical experiments on humans continue at a frantic pace.</p>

<p>    The Soviet press, always masters of the half truth, accused
 the U.S. Army of having engineered the AIDS virus in  the biological
 warfare laboratories at Fort Detrick, Maryland.</p>

<p>    This was  a  clever  psy-war  ploy  which,  for a while anyway,
 neutralized those of us who were saying  essentially the same thing,
 that the AIDS virus was probably created through recombinant genetic
 engineering (the rearranging of genes between two or more species of
 plants or animal) and/or serial passage:  the growing  of a virus in
 a series of  generations  of  tissue  culture cells or live animals,
 thus adapting the virus to a new species, using human tissue culture
 cells in the top security labs at Fort Detrick.</p>

<p>    People started accusing us of spreading the communist line, not
 a comfortable position for a dedicated anti-communist like myself.</p>

<p>    What the Soviet propagandists  didn't say was that their agents
 had been working in our top security biological warfare laboratories
 for over 20 years.</p>

<p>    In a burst of brotherly love they were invited  in by President
 <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>.  The astounded  communist scientists from Russia, the Eastern
 Bloc and Communist china, who had  been  trying  to  penetrate  this
 vital security area for 40 years, quickly accepted.</p>

<p>    They have  been snickering in their beakers ever  since,  while
 they prepare for our demise.</p>

<p>    "It's no  secret  that  they  are there," Dr. <ent type='person'>Carlton Gajdusek</ent>,
 Nobel Prize winner,  a  top  official at  the  Fort  Detrick  Army
 laboratory in Maryland, said in Onmi Magazine (March 1986):  "In
 the facility I have a building where more good and  loyal  communist
 scientists from the USSR and mainland China work, with full passkeys
 to all the  laboratories,  than there are American.  Even the Army's
 infectious disease unit is loaded  with  foreign workers who are not
 always friendly nationals."</p>

<p>    This answer to an interview question refers to  the high number
 of Soviet bloc scientists in this U.S. facility who act as</p>

<p>    Page 4</p>

<p> inspectors to ensure  that  we  are  not  producing  bacteriological
 weapons in violation of treaties with the Soviets.</p>

<p>    You can't put it more plainly than that.  Even the Trojans
 weren't that stupid:  at least they didn't KNOW the Trojan horse
 was full of soldiers.</p>

<p>    When it became obvious to the  Communist  press  that  we  were
 getting the truth out about who was running things  at Fort Detrick,
 they completely reversed  themselves  and said it was all a mistake.
 Everything was just fine at Fort Detrick.</p>

<p>    To understand the enormity of  our betrayal you must know about
 the origin of  the AIDS virus.  The virologists of  the  world,  the
 sorcerers who brought us this ghastly plague, have a united front in
 denying that the virus was laboratory-made from known, lethal animal
 viruses.</p>

<p>    The scientific  party line is that a monkey in Africa with AIDS
 bit a native on the butt.  The native  then went to town and gave it
 to a prostitute who gave it to the local banker who  gave  it to his
 wife and three girlfriends and what!</p>

<p>    50 to 75 million people became infected with AIDS in Africa and
 throughout the world. This  is an entirely preposterous story, and
 it is preposterous because:</p>

<p>  1. The green velvet monkey of Africa doesn't get human AIDS.  You
   can't reproduce the disease  in monkeys even by injecting AIDS
   virus directly into them.</p>

<p>  2. After injecting the virus into monkeys, you can't  transmit it
   to other monkeys, much less to humans.</p>

<p>  3. Genetically, AIDS (HIV-1) is not even close to the monkey form
   of immunodeficiency virus.
   [Ed. Note:  For references on the three items above,
   see: Seale, Dr. John J.,
    Royal Society of Medicine, Sept. 1987,
    Seale, Dr. John J.,
    The Origin of AIDS  --  International
    Conference on AIDS, Cairo, March 1988.]</p>

<p>  4. AIDS started not in the villages but in the cities  of Africa,
   where there are no wild monkeys.</p>

<p>  5. The doubling time of AIDS infection being about 12 months, one
   monkey biting  one native and then spreading the disease would
   have taken 20 years to reach  a  million  cases.  Seventy-five
   million Africans  became infected practically  simultaneously.
   At the same time, the disease became rampant in the U.S.,
   Haiti and Brazil.</p>

<p>    It is  obvious  that one monkey couldn't have done that (or one
 homosexual, either).  There had  to  be  some  sort  of simultaneous
 seeding process.</p>

<p>    The only worldwide simultaneous seeding going  on  at  the same
 time was the smallpox vaccine program of  the  World  Health
 Organization (the WHO).
    Page 5</p>

<p>    The early  epidemiology  of the AIDS pandemic fits the smallpox
 vaccination project of the WHO --  AND  NOTHING  ELSE  --  with  the
 exception of the U.S., which we will examine subsequently.)</p>

<p>    The AIDS virus was created in a laboratory by  combining lethal
 animal "retroviruses" in  human  cancer (HeLA) cell cultures.  These
 viruses have never before caused infection in man.</p>

<p>    The "species barrier" has always been nature's way of keeping a
 deadly virus from wiping out the  entire  animal  kingdom, including
 man.  The myxoma virus of rabbits, for example, wiped out the rabbit
 population of Europe, but man and other animals were not affected.</p>

<p>    The sheep  visna  virus  completely  decimated  the  flocks  of
 Iceland, but no other animal was affected.</p>

<p>    The virologists  deny  that the AIDS virus, HIV-1, is of animal
 origin.  I am sure that you see the  paradox  here. Aren't monkeys
 animals?</p>

<p>    They are also united in saying that it's not possible  for  the
 virus to have  been  engineered  in a laboratory.  If it didn't come
 from other animals and it didn't  come  from  a laboratory, and they
 now admit privately that the monkey couldn't have done  it,  then it
 must have come  out  of thin air.  That's a theological position and
 hence beyond argument.  It's certainly not scientific.</p>

<p>    These scientists who have created  this  monstrous  problem  in
 their sorcerer's retrovirology laboratories are constantly caught in
 their own lies.</p>

<p>    The line goes:  "The AIDS virus could not have  been engineered
 in a laboratory because  the  technology  wasn't  available  until
 recently."</p>

<p>    Icelandic scientists combined  the sheep visna virus with human
 tissue cells over 20 years ago.  The technology has  been refined in
 recent years, but  the  basic process has been actively used in labs
 all over the world for long before  the AIDS virus made its dramatic
 appearance.</p>

<p>    But the  scientists hold fast in their denial  of  culpability.
 Professor <ent type='person'>William Jarrett</ent>  said, when asked about the possibility of
 AIDS arising from animal retroviruses,  "That is like someone saying
 babies come out of cabbages."5</p>

<p>    Dr. Robert  Gallo  said  that  people  who claim AIDS was
 manufactured artificially are "either insane or communists."6</p>

<p>    Dr. Luis  Montagnier,  the  discoverer of the AIDS virus, said,
 "In 1970 there was not enough knowledge  in  genetic  engineering to
 make such a virus starting from already existing viruses."7  (See
 Icelandic experiments mentioned above.)</p>

<p>    This tower of lies must eventually fall of its own weight.
 Then what?  Where do we look for a solution?  Certainly not from
 the people who caused the disaster.</p>

<p>    But where?  -- the Pentagon?  The Pentagon is supporting</p>

<p>    Page 6</p>

<p> research on biological  warfare  in  over  100  federal  and private
 laboratories, including those at many prominent universities.8  Yet,
 <ent type='person'>Neil Levitt</ent>, who worked for 17 years  at the Army Infectious Disease
 Institute, says, "It's  a  joke...there's no defense  against  these
 kinds of organisms.  And if you can't defend against something, then
 why are we pouring more and more money in it?  There's something
 else going on that we don't know about."9</p>

<p>    Some joke.</p>

<p>    A short  virology  lesson will help you understand that AIDS is
 indeed an animal virus and that it  was  laboratory-made as a weapon
 of biological warfare against the free world.</p>

<p>    A basic rule of virology is that if two viruses  have  the same
 shape, design and  size,  then  they  are  almost certainly the same
 virus (a very simple and easy to understand rule).10</p>

<p>    For example, this virus:</p>

<div>   -----------
    |==| ||| |
   -----------</div>

<p> ... a virus of bacteria (bugs have diseases, too), doesn't look
 anything like this virus:</p>

<p>    ___________
   /   \
    / ~~~~~~~ \
    \   /
   \___________/</p>

<p> ... a virus of ticks that's transmitted to pigs, or this virus:</p>

<p>     __________
    ____/  ~~~~  \
     /   ______/
     \________/</p>

<p> ... which is found in horses.</p>

<p>    The AIDS virus, which "couldn't have come from animal
 viruses" is almost certainly a recombinant virus from fusing a
 cattle virus, bovine leukemia virus:</p>

<div>    =
    *
    =*   *=</div>

<div>    =* ++++  *=</div>

<div>    =*   *=
    *
    =</div>

<p>    Page 7</p>

<p> ...with sheep visna virus:</p>

<div>    *
     *   *</div>

<div>     * ====  *</div>

<div>     *   *
    *</div>

<p> You combine the two in human tissue culture cells and you get bovine
 visna virus:</p>

<div>    =
    *
    =*   *=</div>

<div>    =* ====  *=</div>

<div>    =*   *=
    *
    =</div>

<p> ... A VIRUS THAT HERETOFORE DID NOT EXIST -- a product of man,
 engineered in a laboratory.</p>

<p> Now, if you isolate the AIDS virus from an infected human, it
 looks like this:</p>

<div>    =
    *
    =*   *=</div>

<div>    =* ====  *=</div>

<div>    =*   *=
    *
    =</div>

<p> It doesn't look like this (the tick virus):</p>

<p>     __________
    ____/  ~~~~  \
     /   ______/
     \________/</p>

<p> ... or this (the cattle virus):</p>

<div>    =
    *
    =*   *=</div>

<div>    =* ++++  *=</div>

<div>    =*   *=
    *
    =</div>

<p>    Page 8</p>

<p> It looks like THIS:</p>

<div>    =
    *
    =*   *=</div>

<div>    =* ====  *=</div>

<div>    =*   *=
    *
    =</div>

<p> ... the recombinant virus from cattle and sheep AND ITS CALLED
 AIDS.  You don't have to be a genius to understand this.  Any
 properly instructed 10-year-old can understand it ....</p>

<p>    But, some  alert  reader  will  say,  we  don't  give  smallpox
 vaccinations in the U.S., so how do you explain the simultaneous
 outbreak of AIDS in Africa, Brazil  and Haiti, where they did indeed
 give the vaccine,  and  in  the  U.S., where they  didn't  give  the
 vaccine?</p>

<p>    Simple.  The  homosexual community was used as a large group of
 experimental animals through the  hepatitis-B  program. It  didn't
 take many infected homosexuals among the I.V. drug  users to quickly
 spread the disease  among  a  large percentage of the addicts due to
 the near certainly of infection through direct intravenous insertion
 of the virus.</p>

<p>    To understand  the  seeding  of  AIDS  among  homosexuals  (and
 eventually to the rest of us through bisexuals unless drastic action
 is taken), you must know about a character with the  strange name of
 <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Wolf</ent> <ent type='person'>Szmuness</ent></ent>.  His life story will seem bizarre to you unless, like
 me, you have a conspiratorial turn of mind.</p>

<p>    Dr. <ent type='person'>Szmuness</ent>  was  a  Polish  Jew  who supposedly ended up in a
 Siberian labor camp during World  War  II. But  after  the  war he
 somehow became a  privileged person, was sent to medical  school  in
 Tomsk, Russia, and married a Russian  woman. Hardly  typical
 treatment of an enemy of the Soviet state [under Stalin.</p>

<p>    <ent type='person'>Szmuness</ent>' biographer said that <ent type='person'>Wolf</ent> was always reluctant to
 discuss "those dark years in Siberia." Maybe he wasn't in Siberia.
 If he [actually] was, he certainly wasn't shoveling salt.</p>

<p>    In 1959  the  Soviet government "allowed" him  to  practice  in
 Poland in a public health  capacity. Standard  policy  in  all
 Communist countries is never to allow  all  members  of  a family to
 travel out of the country to the West at the same time.</p>

<p>    This eliminates 98 percent of all defection attempts. I  have
 physician friends in  Hungary,  for example.  He can go to a meeting
 anywhere in the world if she stays  home. She  can  go if he stays
 home.  They can both go if the children are left  at  home. But in
 1969, the entire  <ent type='person'>Szmuness</ent> family was allowed by communist Poland to
 go to a medical meeting in Italy. At that time they "defected" and
 moved to New York City.</p>

<p>    WITH NO AMERICAN CREDENTIALS WHATSOEVER, he immediately got a</p>

<p>    Page 9</p>

<p> job as a "lab technician" at the New York City Blood Center.  Within
 a very few  years  this  Polish  immigrant  was GIVEN HIS OWN LAB, a
 separate department of epidemiology was created for him at the blood
 bank and he, like the chrysalis turning  into  a  butterfly, changed
 into a FULL  PROFESSOR  OF  EPIDEMIOLOGY  AT  THE  COLUMBIA  MEDICAL
 SCHOOL!</p>

<p>    In six  years  this "lab tech" became a full professor AND THEN
 WENT BACK TO MOSCOW for a scientific  presentation  and was received
 as a dignitary, not a defector.</p>

<p>    We tell  you  this  amazing story because in retrospect  it  is
 obvious that <ent type='person'>Wolf</ent>  <ent type='person'>Szmuness</ent>  was  a  carefully  groomed  ...  agent,
 planted here after  years of preparation,  to  instigate  biological
 warfare against the American people.</p>

<p>    <ent type='person'>Szmuness</ent>, with  the full cooperation and financial  support  of
 the U.S. Center  for  Disease Control and the National Institutes of
 Health,11 masterminded the hepatitis-B  vaccine experimental program
 used on homosexual men.</p>

<p>    He insisted that only young, promiscuous homosexuals be allowed
 to participate in  the experiment.  The experiment  started  in  New
 York at the blood bank in November 1978.</p>

<p>    THE EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE WAS PRODUCED in  a  government
 supervised laboratory.12  The study  was  completed in October 1979.
 Within 10 years, most of these young men would be dead or dying from
 AIDS.</p>

<p>    In 1980 the program was expanded to major cities all across the
 U.S.  In the fall of 1980 the first AIDS case was  reported  in  San
 Francisco.  Eight years later  most  of  the  homosexuals  in  San
 Francisco are infected, dead or dying.</p>

<p>    <ent type='person'>Szmuness</ent> did  not  live to see  the  fruition  of  this  larger
 experiment.  He died of cancer in 1982.</p>

<p>    In 1986 Dr. <ent type='person'>Cladd Stevens</ent>, one of <ent type='person'>Szmuness</ent>'s collaborators,
 penned an astonishing report that did not make your local newspaper.</p>

<p>    She reported  that  the  majority  of  the homosexuals  in  the
 experimental program were  infected with the AIDS virus.13 The AIDS-
 laced vaccine, through the bridge  of  bisexual  men, now infects as
 many as three million Americans.  Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>    AIDS was not the first germ warfare attack against Americans.</p>

<p>    In the  early  '60s,  millions of unsuspecting  Americans  took
 either <ent type='person'>Salk</ent> injected  polio vaccine or the live <ent type='person'>Sabin</ent> polio vaccine,
 which was taken by mouth.</p>

<p>    BOTH WERE LACED WITH S.V.-40, A CANCER-CAUSING MONKEY VIRUS.14</p>

<p>    With an incubation period of  20  years, we are only now seeing
 the grim results  of this bio-attack against Americans,  largely  in
 the form of brain tumors and leukemia.</p>

<p>    Page 10</p>

<p>    <ent type='person'>Salk</ent> didn't  like  the  <ent type='person'>Sabin</ent> vaccine and <ent type='person'>Sabin</ent> didn't like the
 <ent type='person'>Salk</ent> vaccine.  I think they are both  right. It  is interesting to
 note that polio was rapidly disappearing WITHOUT a vaccine (J. Trop.
 Pediat, env.  Child. Health 21, 11) ....</p>

<p>    Our Soviet  enemies  not  only  instigated  the  AIDS  epidemic
 through clandestine agents  within  our  government,  but  they  now
 control, through the World Health Organization, the AIDS policies of
 the free world.</p>

<p>    You are  probably  not  aware that the  international  AIDS
 prevention program of the World Health Organization  (WHO) is run by
 the Soviets.</p>

<p>    You don't  believe  it?  Call WHO and ask them who is in charge
 in Europe.  If you want to save your  nickel  I'll tell you.  He's a
 Russian named <ent type='person'>Bysencho</ent> and he operates out of Copenhagen....</p>

<p>    The Soviets control the response to AIDS of the entire free
 world at many levels, including the top.  Dr. <ent type='person'>Sergei Litvinov</ent>,
 the coordinator of all task forces on AIDS at the WHO, is a high
 official in the Soviet Ministry of Health.  Allegedly <ent type='person'>Litvinov</ent>
 gave out the  order to our scientists and medical  organizations  in
 the western world not to discuss the real cause of the epidemic.</p>

<p>    At a secret meeting (information supplied the author from a
 confidential source) between  the  editors  of  Lancet,  the  highly
 respected British medical publication,  and  a  group of the leading
 retrovirologists of the  world, it was decided not  to  publish  any
 academic discussion about  the  possible  artificial creation of the
 AIDS virus in a laboratory.</p>

<p>    They particularly agreed not  to  make  any  mention  of world-
 renowned biologist Isaac  Farlane  Bernet's published  remarks  that
 molecular biology may  get  out  of  hand like atomic physics and be
 used for evil  purposes  and "practical  applications  of  molecular
 biology to cancer research might be sinister."</p>

<p>    Other medical journals  such  as  Science and JAMA have
 lockstepped with Lancet and put all references to the man-made
 origins of AIDS down the memory hole.</p>

<p>    Did Comrade  <ent type='person'>Litvinov</ent> have a little talk with the
 retrovirologists?  They, of course,  wouldn't need any encouragement
 from the Soviet [WHO] bosses to attempt a little  coverup  of  their
 own heinous crime,  but Lancet, the British Medical Journal, and the
 New England Journal of Medicine are another matter.</p>

<p>    It took some powerful and sinister  forces  indeed to get these
 respected publications to cover up the crime of the millennium.</p>

<p>    The notable exception to this appalling censorship of mass
 murder is Professor  Harding  Rains, Editor of the  Journal  of  the
 Royal Society of Medicine. Rains  refers  to  "a  conspiracy  of
 silence" covering the allegation that AIDS was man-made.  I hope
 Dr. Rains is watching his backside.</p>

<p>    Dr. <ent type='person'>Zhores Medvedev</ent>, unlike <ent type='person'>Bysencho</ent>  and  <ent type='person'>Litvinov</ent>, supposedly
 is a Russian exile.  <ent type='person'>Medvedev</ent> operates out of London at the National</p>

<p>    Page 11</p>

<p> Institute for Medical  Research. He's  a senior research scientist
 who continues to communicate freely with his supposed enemies in the
 Soviet biowarfare laboratories, but we lack the space to catalog all
 the details [here].</p>

<p>    <ent type='person'>Medvedev</ent> is spreading the disinformation  that  AIDS is rampant
 in Russia due to the escape of the virus from a laboratory,  a  sort
 of biological Chernobyl.</p>

<p>    This tends to divert suspicion away from <ent type='person'>Litvinov</ent>, <ent type='person'>Szmuness</ent> and
 the other reds that  President  <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>  allowed  to  penetrate  our
 biological warfare laboratories at Fort Detrick, Maryland.</p>

<p>    Having the Soviets "control" the spread of AIDS in the West has
 let to some interesting paradoxes. Our masters in the U.S. tell us
 that there shall  be  absolutely no restrictions on  travel  between
 various parts of the  non-Communist  world  by  persons  who  test
 positive for AIDS.</p>

<p>    Surgeon General  C.E.  Koop  supports  this  Soviet  policy  of
 biological suicide.  (Are those the instructions he received when he
 made his trip  to  Moscow, where the WHO has set up  its  main  AIDS
 research center?)</p>

<p>    But, our Soviet masters in the WHO tell us, this open policy of
 international travel does not  apply  to  the  communist  bloc  of
 nations.  If you or I were to visit  Moscow  and tested positive for
 the AIDS virus, POW! -- out on the next plane!</p>

<p>    If they stay clean through their immigration  policies  and  we
 die because of  the  immigration  policies imposed on us through the
 U.N.-controlled World "Health" Organization,  who needs atomic bombs
 for world conquest?</p>

<p>    Cuba, Dr. <ent type='person'>John Seale</ent> informs me, has a strict asylum system for
 the AIDS-infected.  When  their  troops come back from  "liberating"
 Africans, they are tested as they get off the boat.</p>

<p>    If tested  positive  the  soldier  goes  directly  to  hell  --
 euphemistically called a  sanitarium.  He  can  visit  his  family
 occasionally, but only  in  the  presence  of a commissar  called  a
 "health official (no hanky-panky).</p>

<p>    Unless the  West gets its act together and closes down the U.N.
 genocide division called the WHO, freedom and decency will disappear
 from planet Earth for a thousand years. But  the problem goes much
 deeper.</p>

<p>    How do you close down the U.S. government laboratories  such as
 the Centers for  Disease  Control  (CDC),  the National Institute of
 Health (NIH) and  the  Fort  Detrick bio-warfare lab when  the
 perpetrators of the crime are in control at all levels?</p>

<p>    I don't know the answer. *****</p>
