<p><ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>: The Unauthorized Biography</p>

<p>by <ent type='person'>Webster Griffin Tarpley</ent> and <ent type='person'>Anton</ent> Chaitkin</p>

<p>With  this  issue of the New Federalist, Vol. V, No. 39, we begin
to serialize the book, {<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>: The Unauthorized Biography,}
by <ent type='person'>Webster Griffin Tarpley</ent> and <ent type='person'>Anton</ent>  Chaitkin.  This  book  will
soon be published by {Executive Intelligence Review}.</p>

<p> At  the  heart  of  any  effort at biography is the attempt to
discover the essence of the subject as a human personality. The
essential  character  of  the subject is what the biographer must
strive to capture, since this  is  theindispensable  ingredient
that  will provide coherence to the entire story whose unity must
be provided by the course of a single human life.</p>

<p> During the preparation of the  present  work,  there  was  one
historical  moment  which  more  than  any  other  delineated the
character of <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>. The scene was  the  <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>  White  House
during the  final  days  of  the  Watergate debacle.  White House
officials, including <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>, had spent the morning  of  that
Monday,  August 5, 1974 absorbing the impact of <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>'s notorious
``smoking gun'' tape, the recorded conversation between <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent> and
his chief of staff, H.R. Haldemann, shortly  after  the  original
Watergate  break-in,  which  could now no longer be withheld from
the public.  In that exchange of June  23,  1972,  <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>  ordered
that  the CIA stop the FBI from further investigating how various
sums of money found their way from Texas and Minnesota via Mexico
City to the coffers of the Committee to  Re-Elect  thePresident
(CREEP)  and thence into the pockets of the ``Plumbers'' arrested
in the Democratic Party headquarters in the  <ent type='person'>Watergatebuilding</ent>.
These  revelations  were  widely  interpreted  as  establishing a
{prima facie} case of obstruction of justice against <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>.  That
was  fine  with  <ent type='person'>George</ent>,  who  sincerely  wanted  his  patron and
benefactor <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent> to resign.  <ent type='person'>George</ent>'s great concern was that  the
smoking gun tape called attention to a money-laundering mechanism
which  he,  together  with  Bill  <ent type='person'>Liedtke</ent> of Pennzoil, and <ent type='person'>Robert</ent>
<ent type='person'>Mosbacher</ent>, had helped to set up at <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>'s request.  When  <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>,
in  the  ``smoking  gun''  tape,  talked about ``the Texans'' and
``some Texas people,'' <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>, <ent type='person'>Liedtke</ent>, and  <ent type='person'>Mosbacher</ent>  were  among
the most  prominent of those referred to.  The threat to <ent type='person'>George</ent>'s
political ambitions was great.</p>

<p> The White House that morning was  gripped  by  panic.  <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>
would be  gonebeforethe end of the week.  In the midst of the
furor, White House Congressional liaison <ent type='person'>William</ent>  <ent type='person'>Timmons</ent>  wanted
to  know  if  everyone who needed to be informed had been briefed
about the smoking gun transcript.  In  a  roomful  of  officials,
some  of whom were already sipping Scotch to steady their nerves,
<ent type='person'>Timmons</ent> asked <ent type='person'>Dean Burch</ent>,</p>

<p>``Dean, does <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> know about the transcript yet?''
 ``Yes,'' responded Burch.
 ``Well, what did he do?'' inquired <ent type='person'>Timmons</ent>.
 ``He broke out into assholes  and  shit  himself  to  death,''
replied Burch.
 Inthis exchange, which  is  recordedin  <ent type='person'>Woodward</ent>  and
<ent type='person'>Bernstein</ent>'s {The Final Days,} we grasp the essential <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>,
in a crisis, and for all seasons.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>

<p> The thesis of this book is simple: if <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> were  to  be
re-elected in November 1992 for a second term as the President of
the  United  States, this country and the rest of the world would
face a catastrophe of gigantic proportions.</p>

<p> The necessity of writing this book became overwhelming in  the
minds  of the authors in the wake of the ghastly slaughter of the
Iraq war of January-February 1991. That war was an act of  savage
and  premeditated  genocide  on  the  part of <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>, undertaken in
connivance with a clique in London which has, in  its  historical
continuity,  represented  boththe  worst enemy of the long-term
interests  of  the  American  people,  and  the  most  implacable
adversary of the progress of the human species.</p>

<p> Theauthors  observed  <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> as the Gulf crisis and the
war unfolded, and had no doubt that his enraged publicoutbursts
constituted  real  psychotic  episodes,  indicative of a deranged
mental state that was full of ominous portent for humanity. The
authors  were  also horrified by the degree to which their fellow
citizens willfully ignored the shocking reality of  these  public
fits.  A majority of the American people proved more than willing
to lend its support to a despicable enterprise of killing.</p>

<p> By  their  role-call votes of January 12, 1991, the Senate and
the  House  ofRepresentatives  authorized  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  planned  war
measures  to  restore  the  Emir  of  Kuwait,  who owns and holds
chattel slaves.  That vote was a crime against God's justice.</p>

<p> This book is part of an attempt to help the American people to
survive this terrible crime, both for the sake of the  world  and
for their  ownsake. It  is  intended  as a contribution to a
process of education that might help to save the American  people
from the  awesome destruction of a second <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> presidency.  It is
further intended as a warning to all citizens that if  they  fail
to deny <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> a second term, they will deserve what they get after
1993.</p>

<p> As  this book goes to press, public awareness of the long-term
depression of the American economy is rapidly growing. If  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
were re-elected, he would view himself as beyond the reach of the
American  electorate;  with  the  federal  deficit  rising over a
billion dollars a day, a second <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> administration would dictate
such crushing austerity as to bring the country to thebrink  of
civil war.  Some examples of this point are described in the last
chapter of this book.</p>

<p> Ourgoal has been to assemble as much of the truth about <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
as possible within thetime  constraints  imposed  bythe  1992
election. Time  and  resources have not permitted us meticulous
attention to certain matters of detail; we can say, nevertheless,
that both our commitment to the truth and our final  product  are
betterthan  anythinganyoneelse  has  been  able  to muster,
including  news  organizationsand  intelligence  agencies  with
capabilities that far surpass our own.</p>

<p> Why do  we  fight  the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> power cartel with a mere book?  We
have no illusions of easy success, but we were encouraged in  our
work  by  the hope that a biography might stimulate opposition to
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> and his policies.It will  certainly  pose  a  new  set  of
problems for  those seeking to get <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> re-elected.  For although
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> is now what journalists call a  world  leader,  no  accurate
account of his actual career exists in the public domain.</p>

<p> Thevolumewhich  we  submit  to  the  court of world public
opinion is, to the best of our knowledge, the first  book-length,
unauthorized biography of<ent type='person'>George</ent><ent type='person'>Bush</ent>.  It  is  the  first
approximation of the truth about his life. This  is  the  first
biography worthy of the name, a fact that says a great deal about
the sinister  and  obsessive  secrecy of this personage.  None of
the other biographies (including <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  campaign  autobiography)
can  be  takenseriously;  each  of these books is a pastiche of
lies, distortions and banalities that run the gamut from campaign
panegyric, to the <ent type='person'>Goebbels</ent> Big Lie, to fake but edifying  stories
for credulous  children.  Almost without exception, the available
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> literature is worthless as a portrait of the subject.</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s family pedigree establishes him as a networkasset  of
<ent type='person'>Brown</ent>  Brothers  Harriman,  one  of  the  most powerful political
forces in the United States during much of the twentieth century,
and for many years the largest private bank inthe  world.  It
suffices in this context to think of <ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman negotiating
duringWorld  War  IIin  the  name  of  the United States with
Churchill and <ent type='person'>Stalin</ent>, or of the role of <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>  Brothers  Harriman
partner <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Robert</ent> <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent></ent> in guiding <ent type='person'>John</ent> F.  <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent>'s choice of his
cabinet,  to  begin  to  see the implications of Senator <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s post as managing partner of this  bank.  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>  Brothers
Harriman networks  pervade  government and the mass media.  Again
and again in the course  of  the  following  pages  wewill  see
stories embarrassing to <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  refused  publication,
documents  embarrassing  to  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  suspiciously  disappear, and
witnesses  inculpatoryto  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  be  overtaken by mysterious and
conveniently timed deaths.  The few  relevant  facts  which  have
found  their  way  into  the  public domain have necessarily been
filtered by this gigantic  apparatus. This  problemhas  been
compounded by thecorruption and  servility  of  authors,
journalists, news executives and publishers who  have  functioned
more  and  more  as  kept  advocates for a governmental regime of
which <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> has been a prominent part for a quarter-century.</p>

<p>The Red Studebaker Myth</p>

<p> <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> wants key aspects of his life  to  remain  covert.
At  the  same  time,  he  senses  thathis need for coverup is a
vulnerability.The need to protect this weak flank accounts  for
the  steady  stream  of  fake  biographical  material  concerning
<ent type='person'>George</ent>, as well as the spin given to many studies that may  never
mention <ent type='person'>George</ent>directly. Over the past several months, we have
seen a new book about Watergate that pretends to tell the  public
something  newby fingering Al Haig as <ent type='person'>Deep Throat</ent>, but ignoring
the central role of <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> and his business partners in  the
Watergate affair.  We  have a new book by Lt. Col. <ent type='person'>Oliver North</ent>
which alleges that <ent type='person'>Reagan</ent> knew everything about  the  Iran-Contra
affair,  but  that  <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> was not part of North's chain of
command.  The latter point merely  paraphrases<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'sown  lame
excusethat  he was ``out of the loop'' during all those illegal
transactions.  During the hearings on the  nomination  of  <ent type='person'>Robert</ent>
Gates  to  become  director  of  Central Intelligence, nobody had
anything new to add about the role of <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>,  the  boss  of
the  National  Security  Council's Special Situation Group crisis
staff that was a command center for  the  whole  affair.  These
charades  are  peddledto  a very credulous public by operatives
whose task goes beyond mere damage control to  mind  control--the
``MK'' in the government's MK-Ultra operation.</p>

<p> Part  of  the free ride enjoyed by <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> during the 1988
elections is reflected in the  fact  that  at  no  point  in  the
campaign  was  there  any  serious  effort  <ent type='person'>byany</ent>  of  the news
organizations to provide the public with an accurate and complete
account of his political career.  At  least  two  biographies  of
<ent type='person'>Dukakis</ent>  appeared  which,  although  hardly  critical,were  not
uniformly laudatory either.  But in the case  of  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>,  all  the
public could turn to was <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s old 1980 campaign biography and a
newer campaign autobiography, both of them a tissue of lies.</p>

<p> Early  in the course of our research for the present volume it
became apparent that all books and most longerarticles  dealing
with  the  life  of  <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> had been generated from a single
print-out of thoroughly approved ``facts''  about  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  and  his
family. We  learned that during 1979-80, <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> aide <ent type='person'>Pete Roussel</ent>
attempted to recruit biographers to prepare a life of <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  based
on  a  collection  of press releases, news summaries, and similar
pre-digested material. Most  biographical  writing  about  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
consists  merely  of  the  points  from this printout, strung out
chronologically  and  made into anarrative through the
interpretation of comments, anecdotes, embellishments, or special
stylistic devices.</p>

<p> Thecanonical  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>-approved  printout is readily identified.
One dead giveaway is the inevitability with which the  hacks  out
to  cover  up  the  substance  of <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s life refer to a 1947 red
Studebaker which <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> allegedly drove into  Odessa,  Texas
in  1948.  This  is  the sort of detail which has been introduced
into <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s real life in a deliberate and  deceptive  attempt  to
humanize his  image.It  has been our experience that any text
that features a reference to <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s red Studebaker  has  probably
been derived from <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s list of approved facts, and is therefore
practically worthless  for serious research into <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s life.  We
therefore assign such texts to the ``red Studebaker  school''  of
coverup and falsification.</p>

<p> Some examples?  This  is from <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s campaign autobiography,
{Looking Forward,} ghost-written by his aide <ent type='person'>Vic Gold</ent>:``Heading
into  Texas  in  my  Studebaker,  all  I  knewabout the state's
landscape was what I'd seen from the cockpit of a Vultee Vibrator
during my training days in the Navy.''s1
 Here is the same moment as recaptured by <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s crony Fitzhugh
Green, a friend of the Malthusian financier <ent type='person'>Russell Train</ent>, in his
{<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>: An Intimate Portrait,} published after <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> had won
the presidency:  ``He  (<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>)  gassed  up  his1948  Studebaker,
arranged  for  his wife and son to follow, and headed for Odessa,
Texas.''s2</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Harry Hurt III</ent> wrote the  followinglines  in  a  1983  Texas
magazine  article  that was even decorated with a drawing of what
apparently is supposed to be a Studebaker,  but  whichdoes  not
look  like  a  Studebaker  of  that vintage at all: ``When <ent type='person'>George</ent>
<ent type='person'>Herbert</ent> <ent type='person'>Walker</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> drove his battered red Studebaker into Odessa
in the summer of 1948, the town's population,  though  constantly
increasing  with  newly-arrived  oil field hands, was still under
30000.''s3</p>

<p> We see that <ent type='person'>Harry Hurt</ent> has more  imagination  than  many  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
biographers,  and  <ent type='person'>hisarticle</ent>  does provide a few useful facts.
More degraded is the version offered by <ent type='person'>Richard Ben Kramer</ent>, whose
biography of <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> is expected to be published during 1992. <ent type='person'>Cramer</ent>
was given the unenviable task of breathing life  once  more  into
the same  tired  old  printout. But the very fact that the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
team feels that it requires another biography indicates  that  it
still feels  that  it has a potential vulnerability here.  <ent type='person'>Cramer</ent>
has attempted to solve his problem  byrecasting  thesame  old
garbage  into  a  frenetic  and hyperkinetic, we would almost say
{hyperthyroid} style.  The following is from an excerpt  of  this
forthcoming  book  that  was published in {Esquire} in June 1991:
``In June, after the College World Series and graduation  day  in
New  Haven,  Poppy packed up his new red Studebaker (a graduation
gift from Pres), and started driving south.''s4</p>

<p> Was that <ent type='person'>Studebakershiny</ent>  and  new,  or  old  andbattered?
Perhaps  the printout is not specific on this point; in any case,
as we see, our authorities diverge.</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Joe Hyams</ent>'s 1991 romance of <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> at war, the  {Flight  of  the
Avenger,}s5  does  notinclude the obligatory ``red Studebaker''
reference, but this is more than  compensated  for  bythe  most
elaborate  fawning  over other details of our hero's war service.
The publication of {Flight of the Avenger,} which concentrates on
an heroic  retelling  of  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  war  record,and  ignores  all
evidence  thatmight  tend  to  puncture this myth, was timed to
coincide with <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s war with Iraq. This is a vile tract  written
with  the  open  assistance  of <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>, <ent type='person'>Barbara</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>, and the White
House staff.  {Flight of the Avenger}  recallsthe  practice  of
totalitarian  states according to which a war waged by the regime
should be accompanied by propaganda which  depicts  the  regime's
strong man  ina  martial posture.  In any case, this book deals
with <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s life up to the end of World War II;  we  never  reach
Odessa.</p>

<p> Only  one  of  the  full-length  accounts produced by the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
propaganda machine neglects the red Studebaker story. This  is
<ent type='person'>Nicholas King</ent>'s {<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>: A Biography,} the first book-length
version  of  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  life, produced as a result of <ent type='person'>Pete Roussel</ent>'s
efforts for the 1980 campaign.  Nicholas  King  had  served  as
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'sspokesman  when  he  was  U.S.Ambassador  to the United
Nations.  King admits in his preface that he can be impugned  for
writing a  work  of  the  most  transparent  apologetics:  ``In
retrospect,'' he says , ``this book may seem open to  the  charge
of  puffery,  for  theview  of  its  subjectis  favorable all
around.''s6 Indeed.</p>

<p> Books about <ent type='person'>Barbara</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> slavishly rehearse the  same  details
from the  sameprintout. Here is the relevant excerpt from the
warmly admiring {Simply <ent type='person'>Barbara</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>:  A  Portrait  ofAmerica's
CandidFirst  Lady,}  writtenby <ent type='person'>Donnie Radcliffe</ent> and published
after <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s 1988 election victory: ``With $3000 left over after
he graduated in June, 1948, he headed for Texas in the1947  red
Studebaker his father had given him for graduation after <ent type='person'>George</ent>'s
car died on the highway.''s7</p>

<p> Even  foreign  journalists  attempting to inform their publics
about conditions in the United States have fallen victim  to  the
same old  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>printout. The German author and reporter Rainer
Bonhorst, the former <ent type='person'>Washingtoncorrespondentof</ent>  the
{Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung,} in his 1988 book {<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>:
The  New  Man  in  the White House,} named a chapter of this <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
political biography ``To Texas in the Red Studebaker.''  Bonhorst
writesas  follows: ``Then there was still the matter of the red
Studebaker. It  plays--rightafter  the  world  wareffort--a
central  role  in  thelife  history  of  <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>. It is the
history of his rebellion.  The step which made a  careless  Texan
out  of  a  stiff  NewEnglander,  a  self-made  man  out  ofa
patrician's son, born into wealth....  Thus, <ent type='person'>George</ent>  and  <ent type='person'>Barbara</ent>
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>,  24  and23  years  old,  he having just finished with his
studies, she having prematurely withdrawn from her university and
become a mother a few months earlier, packed their baby and their
suitcases and loaded  them  into  their  glaring  red  Studebaker
coupe.</p>

<p> ``Asupermodern, smart car, certainly somewhat loud for the
New England taste,' the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>es later recalled. But  finally  it
departed towards Texas.''s8
 We  see  that  Bonhorst  isacutely  awareof  the  symbolic
importance assumed by the red Studebaker  in  these  hagiographic
accounts of <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s life.</p>

<p> What is finally the truth of the matter?  There is good reason
to  believe that <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> did not first come to Odessa, Texas,
in a red Studebaker. One knowledgeable source is  the  well-known
Texas  oil  man  and  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  campaign  contributor  <ent type='person'>Oscar Wyatt</ent> of
Houston. In  arecentletterto  the  {Texas  Monthly,}  <ent type='person'>Wyatt</ent>
specifies that ``when  people  speak  of  Mr.  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  humble
beginnings in the oil industry, it should be noted that  he  rode
down to  Texas on <ent type='person'>Dresser</ent>'s private aircraft.  He was accompanied
by his father, who at that time  was  one  of  the  directors  of
<ent type='person'>Dresser</ent>  Industries....  I  hate  it  when people make statements
about Mr. <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s humble beginnings in the oil industry.  It  just
didn'thappenthat  way,''  writes  Mr.  <ent type='person'>Wyatt</ent>.s9 <ent type='person'>Dresser</ent> was a
Harriman company, and <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> got his start working for one  of  its
subsidiaries.One  history  of  <ent type='person'>Dresser</ent>  Industries  contains a
photograph of <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> with his parents, wife, and infant  son
``in front of a <ent type='person'>Dresser</ent> company airplane in West Texas.''s1s0 Can
this  be a photo of <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s arrival in Odessa during the summer of
1948?  In  anycase,  this  most  cherished  myth  ofthe  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
biographers is very much open to doubt.</p>

<p>The Roman Propaganda Machine</p>

<p> Fawning biographies of bloodthirsty tyrants are nothing new in
world literature.  The  red  Studebaker school goes back a long
way; these writers of today  can  be  usefullycompared  witha
certain  Gaius <ent type='person'>Velleius Paterculus</ent>, who lived in the Roman Empire
under the emperors <ent type='person'>Augustus</ent> and <ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent>, and  who  was  thus  an
approximate contemporary of Jesus Christ. <ent type='person'>Velleius Paterculus</ent> was
an  historian  and  biographer who is known today, if at all, for
his  biographical  notes  on  the  Emperor  <ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent>,  which  are
contained within <ent type='person'>Paterculus</ent>'s history of Rome.</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Paterculus</ent>,writing  under<ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent>,  gave  a very favorable
treatment of <ent type='person'>Julius Caesar</ent>, and became fulsome when  he  came  to
write  of  <ent type='person'>Augustus</ent>.  But  the worst excesses of flattery came in
<ent type='person'>Velleius Paterculus</ent>'s treatment of <ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent>  himself. Here  is
part of what he writes about that tyrannical ruler:</p>

<p> ``Of  the  transactions  of the last sixteen years, which have
passed in the view, and are fresh in the memory of all, who shall
presume to give a full account?  ... credit has been restored  to
mercantile  affairs,  seditionhas been banished from the forum,
corruption  from  the  Campus  Martius,  and  discord  from the
senate-house;  justice,  equity and industry, which had long lain
buried in neglect, have been revived in the state; authority  has
been  given  to  the  magistrates,  majesty  to  the  senate, and
solemnity to the courts of  justice;  the  bloody  riots  in  the
theatre  have  been  suppressed,  and  all  men have had either a
desire excited in them, or a necessity imposed on them, of acting
with integrity.  Virtuous actsare  honored,  wicked  deeds  are
punished. The  humble  respects  the powerful, without dreading
him;  the  powerful  takes  precedenceof  the  humble without
condemning him.  When  were  provisions more moderate in price?
When were the blessings of peace more abundant?  Augustan  peace,
diffused  overall the regions of the east and the west, and all
that lies between the south and the north, preserves every corner
of the world  free  from  all  dread  of  predatory  molestation.
Fortuitous  losses,  not  only of individuals, but of cities, the
munificence of the prince is ready to relieve.  The  cities  of
Asia have been repaired; the provinces have been secured from the
oppression of  their  governors.  Honor  promptly  rewards  the
deserving,  and  the  punishment  of  the  guilty,  ifslow,  is
certain. Interest  gives  place  to  justice,  solicitation  to
merit.For the best of princes teaches  his  countrymen  to  act
rightly  by  his  own  practice;  and while he is the greatest in
power, he is still greater in example.</p>

<p> ``Having exhibited a general view  of  the  administration  of
<ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent> Caesar, let  us  now  enumerate  a  few  particulars
respecting it....  How formidable a war, excited  by  the  Gallic
chief Sacrovir and <ent type='person'>Julius Florius</ent>, did he suppress, and with such
amazing expedition and energy, that the Roman people learned that
they were conquerors, before they knew that they were at war, and
the news  of the victory outstripped the news of the danger!  The
African war too, perilous as it  was,  and  daily  increasing  in
strength, was quickly terminatedunder  his  auspices  and
direction....''s1s1</p>

<p> All of this was written in praise of the regime that crucified
Jesus Christ, and one of the worst  genocidal  tyrannies  in  the
history of  the world.<ent type='person'>Paterculus</ent>, we must sadly conclude, was a
sycophant of the <ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent> administration.  Some of his themes are
close parallels to the propaganda of today's <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> machine.</p>

<p> In addition to  feeding  the  personality  cult  of<ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent>,
<ent type='person'>Paterculus</ent>  also  lavished  praise  on <ent type='person'>Lucius Aelius Sejanus</ent>, the
Prefect of the Praetorian Guard and  for  manyyears  <ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent>'s
number one favorite, second in command, and likely successor.  In
many  respectsSejanus  was not unlike <ent type='person'>James Baker III</ent> under the
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> regime.  While <ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent> spent all of his time  inseclusion
on  his  island  of Capri near Naples, Sejanus assumed day to day
control  of  the  vastempireand  its  100  millionsubjects.
<ent type='person'>Paterculus</ent>  wrote  of  Sejanusthat  he  was  ``a most excellent
coadjutor in all the toils of government ... aman  of  pleasing
gravity, and  of unaffected cheerfulness ...  assuming nothing to
himself.'' That was the voice of the  red  Studebaker  school  in
about  30  A.D.  <ent type='person'>Paterculus</ent>  should  have  limited his fawning to
<ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent> himself; somewhat later, the emperor, suspecting a  coup
plot,  condemned  Sejanus  andhad  him  tornlimb from limb in
gruesome retribution.</p>

<p> But why bring up Rome?  Some readers may be scandalized by the
things that truth obliges us to record about a sittingpresident
of  the  United  States.  Are  we  not disrespectful to this high
office?  No. One of the reasons for  glancing  back  at  Imperial
Rome  is  to remind ourselves that in times of moral and cultural
degradation like our own, rulers of  great  evil  haveinflicted
incalculable <ent type='person'>sufferingon</ent>  humanity.In our modern time of war
and depression, this is once again the case.If  <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>  was
possible  then, who could claim that the America of the New World
Order should be exempt?  Let us therefore tarry for a moment with
these old Romans, because they can show us much about ourselves.</p>

<p> In order to find Roman writers who tell us  anything  reliable
about  the  first dozen emperors, we must wait until the infamous
Julio-Claudian dynastyof  Julius  Caesar,  <ent type='person'>Augustus</ent>,<ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent>,
<ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>,  Claudius,  <ent type='person'>Nero</ent>, and the rest had entirely passed from
the scene, to be supplanted  by  new  ruling  houses. <ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent>
reigned  from  14 to 37 A.D.; <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>, his designated successor,
from 37 to 41 A.D.; and <ent type='person'>Nero</ent> from 54 to 68  A.D.  But  the  first
accurate  account  of  the crimes of some of these emperors comes
from Publius Cornelius Tacitus in about 115-17 A.D., late in  the
reign of the emperor <ent type='person'>Trajan</ent>. It was feasible for Tacitus to write
and  publish  a  more  realistic  account  of  the Julio-Claudian
emperors  because  oneof  the  constant  themes of <ent type='person'>Trajan</ent>'s
propaganda  was  to  glorify  himself  as  an enlightened emperor
through comparison with the earlier series of bloody tyrants.</p>

<p> Tacitus manages to convey how  the  destructivenessof  these
emperors  in  their  personal  lives  correlated  with their mass
executions and their genocidal economic policies.  Tacitus  was
familiar  withthe  machinery of Roman Imperial power: he was of
senatorial rank, served as consul in Italy in 97  A.D.,  and  was
the  governor  of  theimportant  province  of  western Anatolia
(today's Turkey) which the Romans referred  tosimplyas  Asia.
Tacitus  writes of <ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent>: ``... his criminal lusts shamed him.
Their uncontrollable activity was worthy of anoriental  tyrant.
Free-born children  were  his  victims.  He  was  fascinated by
beauty, youthful innocence, and aristocratic birth.  New  names
for types  of  perversions were invented.  Slaves were charged to
locate and procure his requirements....  It was like the sack  of
a captured city.''</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent>  was  ableto dominate the legislative branch of his
government, the senate,  by  subversion  and  terror:  ``It  was,
indeed,  a  horrible feature of this period that leading senators
became informers  evenon  trivial  matters--some  openly,  many
secretly. Friends  and  relatives were as suspect as strangers,
old stories as damaging as  new.  Inthe  Main  Square,  ata
dinner-party,  a  remark  on  any subject might mean prosecution.
Everyone competed  forpriority  in  marking  down  the  victim.
Sometimes  this  was  self-defense,  but  mostly it was a sort of
contagion, like an epidemic....  I realize that many writers omit
numerous trials and condemnations, bored by repetition or  afraid
that  catalogues  they themselves have found over-long and dismal
may equally depress  their  readers.But  numerous  unrecorded
incidents, which have come to my attention, ought to be known.</p>

<p> ``... Even  women  were  in danger.They could not be charged
with aiming at supreme power.  So they were charged with weeping:
one old lady was executed for lamenting her  son's  death.  The
senate decidedthis case....  In the same year the high price of
corn nearly caused riots....</p>

<p> ``Frenzied  with  bloodshed,  (<ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent>) now ordered the
execution  of  all those arrested for complicity with Sejanus. It
was a massacre.  Without discrimination of sex or  age,  eminence
or obscurity,  therethey  lay,  strewn  about--or  in  heaps.
Relatives and friends were forbidden to stand by or lament  them,
or even  gaze  for long.  Guards surrounded them, spying on their
sorrow, and escorted the rotting bodies  until,  dragged  to  the
<ent type='person'>Tiber</ent>,they  floated  away  or grounded--with none to cremate or
touch them.  Terror had paralyzed human  sympathy.  The  rising
surge of brutality drove compassion away.''s1s2</p>

<p> This  is  the  same<ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent>  administration so extravagantly
praised by <ent type='person'>Velleius Paterculus</ent>.
 Because of lacunae in the manuscripts of Tacitus's  work  that
have  come  down  to  us,  much  of  what  we know of the rule of
<ent type='person'>Caligula</ent> (Gaius Caesar, in power from 37 to 41 A.D.) derives from
{The Lives of the Twelve Caesars,}  a  book  by  Gaius<ent type='person'>Suetonius</ent>
Tranquillus. The character and administration of <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent> present
some striking parallels with the subject of the present book.</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Asa</ent>  stoic,  <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>  was  a  great  admirer  of  his  own
``immovable rigor.'' His motto was ``Remember  that  Ihave  the
right  to  do  anything  to  anybody.''  He made no secret of his
bloodthirsty vindictiveness.  <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent> was a  fan  of  the  green
team  in  the  Roman  arena,  and  when  the  crowd  applaudeda
charioteer who wore a different color, <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>  criedout,  ``I
wish  the  Roman  people  had  but a single neck.'' At one of his
state  dinners<ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>  burst  into  a  fit  of  uncontrollable
laughter,  andwhen  a  consul  askedhim what was so funny, he
replied that it was the thought that as emperor <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent> had  the
power to have the throats of the top officials cut at any time he
chose. <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>  carried  this  same attitude into his personal
life: whenever he kissed or caressed the neck of his wife or  one
of his mistresses, he liked to remark: ``Off comes this beautiful
head whenever I give the word.''</p>

<p> Above all,  <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>  was  vindictive.  After his death, two
notebooks were found among  his  personal  papers,  one  labelled
``The  Sword''and the other labelled ``The Dagger.'' These were
lists of the persons he had proscribed and liquidated,and  were
the  forerunners  of the enemies lists and discrediting committee
of today.  <ent type='person'>Suetonius</ent> frankly calls <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>  ``a  monster,''  and
speculates on thepyschologicalrootsof  his  criminal
disposition: ``I think I may attributeto  mental  weakness  the
existence  of  two  exactly  opposite  faults in the same person,
extreme assurance and, on theotherhand,excessive
timorousness.''  <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>  was``full of threats'' against ``the
barbarians,'' but at the same time prone to precipitous  retreats
and flights  of  panic.  <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent> worked on his ``body language''
by ``practicing all kinds of terrible  and  fearsome  expressions
before a mirror.''</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>  built an extension of his palace to connect with the
Temple of Castor and Pollux, and  often  went  there  to  exhibit
himself  as  an  object  of  public  worship, delighting in being
hailed as ``Jupiter Latiaris'' by the populace. Later  <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>
would officially  opentemples  in  his  own name.  <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent> was
brutal in his  intimidation  of  the  senate,  whose  members  he
subjected  to open humiliations and covert attacks; many senators
were ``secretly put to death.'' ``He often inveighed against  all
the Senators  alike....  He  treated the other orders with like
insolence and cruelty.'' <ent type='person'>Suetonius</ent> recites  whole  catalogues  of
``special  instances  of his innate brutality'' toward persons of
all walks of life.  He enjoyed inflicting torture,  and  revelled
in  liquidating  political opponents or those who had insulted or
snubbed him in some way.  He had a taste for  capital  executions
as theperfect backdrop for parties and banquets.  <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent> also
did everything he could to denigrate the memory of the great  men
of  past  epochs,  so  that their fame could not eclipse his own:
``He assailed mankind of almost every epoch with no less envy and
malice than insolence and cruelty.  He threw down the statues  of
famous men'' and tried to destroy all the texts of Homer.</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>  ``respected neither his own chastity nor that of any
one else.'' He was reckless in his extravagance, and soon emptied
out the imperial treasury of all the funds that old <ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent>  had
squirreled away  there. After that, <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent> tried to replenish
his  coffers  through  a  system  of  spies,  false  accusations,
property seizures, and public auctions.  He also ``levied new and
unheard-of  taxes,''  to the point that ``no class of commodities
was exempt from some kind of tax or other.'' <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>  taxed  all
foodstuffs,  took  a  fortiethof  the  award in any lawsuit, an
eighth of the daily wages of the porters, and demandedthat  the
prostitutes  pay  him  a  daily  fee  equal  to the average price
charged to each individual customer.  (It is  rumored  that  this
part of <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>'s career is under study by those planning <ent type='person'>George</ent>
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s second term.) <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent> also opened a brothel in his palace
as  anadditional  source of income, which may prefigure today's
White House  staff.  Among  <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>'s  moresingular  hobbies
<ent type='person'>Suetonius</ent>  includes his love of rolling and wallowing in piles of
gold coins.</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent> kept his wife, Caesonia (describedby  <ent type='person'>Suetonius</ent>  as
``neither  beautiful  nor  young'')  with him until the very end.
But his greatest devotion was to his horse, whom he  made  consul
of theRoman  state. Ultimately  <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>  fell  victim  to a
conspiracy of the Praetorian Guard,  led  by  the  tribune  Gaius
Chaerea,  a  man  whom<ent type='person'>Caligula</ent>  had  taken  special  delight in
humiliating.s1s3</p>

<p> The authors of the present  study  are  convinced  that  these
references  tothe  depravityof the Roman emperors, and to the
records of that depravity provided by such authors as Tacitus and
<ent type='person'>Suetonius</ent>, are directly germane to our present task offollowing
the career of  a  member  of  the  senatorial  class  of  the
Anglo-American elite through the various stages of hisformation
and ultimate  ascent to imperial power.  The Roman Imperial model
is germane because the American rulingelite  of  today  is  far
closerto  the  world of <ent type='person'>Tiberius</ent> and <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent> than it is to the
world of the American Revolution or the Constitutional Convention
of 1789. The leitmotif of modern American  presidential  politics
is  unquestionably an imperial theme, most blatantly expressed by
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> in his slogan for 1990, ``The NewWorld  Order,''  and  for
1991,  the  ``pax  universalis.'' The central project of the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
presidency  isthe  creation  and  consolidation  of  a  single,
universal  Anglo-American  (orAnglo-Saxon) empire very directly
modelled on the various phases of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>The Olympian Delusion</p>

<p> There is  one  other  aspect  of  the  biographical-historical
methodof the Graeco-Roman world which we have sought to borrow.
Ever  since  Thucydides  composed  hismonumental  work  on  the
PeloponnesianWar, those  who  have  sought  to  imitate  his
style--with the Roman  historian  Titus  Livius  prominent  among
them--have  employed  the  device of attributing long speeches to
historical personages, even when it appears  very  unlikely  that
such lengthy orations could have been made by the protagonists at
the time. This has nothing to do with the synthetic dialogue of
current American political writing,  which  attempts  to  present
historical  events  asa  series of trivial and banal soap-opera
exchanges, which carry on for such  interminable  lengths  as  to
suggest that  the authors are getting paid by the word.  Our idea
of fidelity to the classical style has simply been to let  <ent type='person'>George</ent>
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> speak for  himself  wherever  possible,  through  direct
quotation.  We are convinced that by letting <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> express himself
directly in this way, we afford the reader a  more  faithful--and
damning--account of <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s actions.</p>

<p> <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>  might  agreethat  ``history  is  biography,''
although we suspect that he would not agree with any of our other
conclusions.  There may be a few  peculiarities  of  the  present
work as biography that are worthy of explanation at the outset.</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Oneof</ent> our basic theses is that <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> is, and considers
himself to be, an oligarch.  The  notion  of  oligarchy  includes
first  of  all the idea of a patrician and wealthy family capable
of introducing its offspring  into  such  elite  institutions  as
Andover, Yale,and Skull and Bones.  Oligarchy also subsumes the
self-conception of  the  oligarch  as  belonging  to  a  special,
exalted  breed of mankind, one that is superior to the common run
of mankind as a matter of hereditary genetic superiority.  This
mentality generallygoes  togetherwith  a  fascination  for
eugenics, race science and  just  plain  racism  as  ameans  of
building  a  case that one's own family tree and racial stock are
indeed superior.  These notions of ``breeding'' are a constant in
the  history  of  the  titled  feudal  aristocracy of Europe,
especially Britain, towards inclusion in which an individual like
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> must  necessarily strive.At the very least, oligarchs like
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> see themselves as demigods occupying a middle ground between
the immortals above and the {hoi polloi} below.  The  culmination
of  this  insane delusion, which <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> has demonstrably long since
attained, is the obsessive belief that the principal families  of
the  Anglo-American elite, assembled in their freemasonic orders,
by themselves directly constitute an Olympian Pantheon of  living
deities  who  have  the capability of abrogating and disregarding
the laws of  the  universe  according  to  their  own  irrational
caprice. If  we  do not take into account this element of fatal
and megalomaniac hubris, the lunatic Anglo-American  policies  in
regardto  the  Gulf  War,  international  finance,  or the AIDS
epidemic must defy all comprehension.</p>

<p> Part of the ethos of oligarchism as practiced by  <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
is theemphasis on one's own family pedigree.This accounts for
the attention we dedicate in the opening chapters of this book to
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s family tree, reaching back to the nineteenth  century  and
beyond. It  is impossible to gain insight into <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s mentality
unless we realize that it is important for him to be considered a
cousin, however distant, of Queen <ent type='person'>Elizabeth</ent> II of  theHouse  of
Mountbatten-Windsor and for his wife <ent type='person'>Barbara</ent> to be viewed in some
sense a descendant of President <ent type='person'>Franklin Pierce</ent>.</p>

<p>The Family Firm</p>

<p> Forrelated reasons, it is our special duty to illustrate the
role played in the formation of <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> as a  personality  by
his  maternal  grandfather  and  uncle, <ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Herbert</ent> <ent type='person'>Walker</ent> and
<ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Herbert</ent> <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>, Jr., and by <ent type='person'>George</ent> H.W. <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s father, the
late Senator <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>. In the course of this task,  we  must
speak  at  length about the institution to which <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> owes
the most, the Wall Street international investment bank of  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>
Brothers Harriman, the  political  and  financial  powerhouse
mentioned above.  For <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>, <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>  Brothers  Harriman  was
and remains the family firm in the deepest sense.  The formidable
power of this bank and its ubiquitous network, wielded by Senator
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> up through the time of his death in 1972, and still
activeon <ent type='person'>George</ent>'s behalf down to the present day, is the single
most important key to every step  of  <ent type='person'>George</ent>'sbusiness,  covert
operations, and political career.</p>

<p> In  the  case  of  <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>,  as  many  who have known him
personally  have  noted,  the  networklooms  much  larger  than
<ent type='person'>George</ent>'s own  character and will.  The reader will search in vain
for strong principled commitments in <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  personality;
the  most  that  will  be  found  is  a  series of characteristic
obsessions, of which the most durable are race, vanity,  personal
ambition, and  settling scores with adversaries.  What emerges by
contrast  is  the  decisive  importance  of  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  network of
connections. His  response  to  the Gulf crisis of 1991 will be
largely predetermined, not by any great flashes  of  geopolitical
insight,  but rather by his connections to the British oligarchy,
to <ent type='person'>Kissinger</ent>, to Israeli and Zionist circles, to Texas oilmen  in
his  fundraising  base,  to  the  Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti royal
houses.  If the question is one of finance, then the opinions  of
J.  Hugh  <ent type='person'>Liedtke</ent>,  Henry  Kravis,  <ent type='person'>Robert</ent>  <ent type='person'>Mosbacher</ent>,T.  Boone
Pickens, <ent type='person'>Nicholas Brady</ent>, <ent type='person'>James Baker III</ent> and the City  of  London
will be  decisive. If covert operations and dirty tricks are on
the agenda, then there is a whole stable of  CIA  old  boys  with
whom he  will  consult,  and so on down the line.  During much of
1989, despite his control over the presidency, <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> appeared as a
weak and passive executive, waiting for his networks to show  him
what it was he was supposed to do.  When German reunification and
the  crumblingof  the  Soviet  empire  spurred those--primarily
British--networks intoaction,  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  was  suddenly  capable  of
violent and  daring  adventures.  As his battle for a second term
approaches, <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> may be showing increasing signs of a rage-driven
self-starter capability, especially when it comes to starting new
wars designed to secure his re-election.</p>

<p>The United States in Decline</p>

<p> Biography  has  itsown  inherent  discipline:  Itmust be
concerned  with the life of its protagonist, and cannot stray too
far away.  In no way has  it  been  our  intention  tooffer  an
account  of  American history during the lifetime of <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>.
The present study neverthelessreflects  manyaspects  of  that
recent <ent type='person'>historyof</ent>  U.S. decline.  It will be noted that <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> has
succeeded in proportion as  the  country  has  failed,and  that
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s advancement has proceeded {paripassu}with  the
degradation of the national stage upon which he has operated  and
which he  has come to dominate.  At various phases in his career,
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> has come into conflict with persons who were  intellectually
and morally  superior  to  him.  Onesuch  was  Senator  Ralph
Yarborough, and another was Senator <ent type='person'>Frank Church</ent>. Our study  will
be  found  to  catalogue the constant decline in the qualities of
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s adversaries as human types until the 1980s, by which  time
his opponents, as in the case of Al Haig, are no better than <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
himself.</p>

<p> Theexception  to this trend is <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s long-standing personal
vendetta against Lyndon LaRouche, his most consistent and capable
adversary. LaRouche  was  jailed  seven days after <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s
inauguration  in  the  most  infamous political frameup of recent
U.S. history.  As our study will document, at critical moments in
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s career, LaRouche's political interventions have frustrated
some of <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s best-laid political plans: A very clear example is
LaRouche's role in defeating <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s 1980 presidential bid in  the
New Hampshire  primary.  Over the intervening years, LaRouche has
become <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>'s ``man in the  iron  mask,''  the  principled
political  adversary  whom  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> seeks to jail and silence at all
costs.The restoration of justice in this country  must  include
the  freeing of Lyndon LaRouche, LaRouche's political associates,
and all the other political prisoners of the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> regime.</p>

<p> As for the political relevance of our project, we  think  that
it is  very  real.  During  the Gulf crisis, it would have been
important for the public  to  know  more  about  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  business
dealings  withthe  Royal  Family  ofKuwait.  During  the 1992
presidential campaign, as Wall Street's recent crop ofjunk-bond
assisted  leveraged buyouts line up at the entrance to bankruptcy
court, and  state  workers  all  across  the  United  States  are
informed that the retirement pensions they had been promised will
never be paid, the relations between <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> and <ent type='person'>Henry Kravis</ent>
will surely  constitute an explosive political issue.  Similarly,
once <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s British and <ent type='person'>Kissinger</ent>ian pedigree is recognized,  the
methods  he  is  likely to pursue in regard to situations such as
the planned Romanian-style overthrow  of  the  <ent type='person'>Castro</ent>  regime  in
Cuba,  or  theprovocation  of  a  splendid  little  nuclear war
involving North Korea, or  of  a  new  Indo-Pakistani  war,  will
hardly be mysterious.</p>

<p> Theauthors  have  been  at  some  pains  to  makethis work
intelligible to readers around the world.  We offer this book  to
those  who  share our aversion to the imperialist-colonialist New
World Order, and our profound horror at the concept ofa  return
to  a single, worldwide Roman Empire as suggested by <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s ``pax
universalis'' slogan.  This work is tangible evidence that  there
is  anopposition to <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> inside the United States, and that the
new <ent type='person'>Caligula</ent> is very  vulnerable  indeed  on  the  level  of  the
exposure of his own misdeeds.</p>

<p> It  will  be  argued that this book should have been published
before the 1988 election, when a <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> presidency might have  been
avoided. That  is  certainly true, but it is an objection which
should also be directed to many institutions and  agencies  whose
resources far  surpassour  modest  capabilities.  We can only
remind our fellow citizens that when he asks for their votes  for
his  re-election,  <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  also enters that court of public
opinion in which he is obliged to answer their questions.  They
shouldnot waste this opportunity to grill him on all aspects of
his career and future intentions, since  it  is  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  who  comes
forward appealing  for their support.  To aid in this process, we
have provided a list of TwentyQuestions  forCandidate  <ent type='person'>George</ent>
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  on  the  campaign  trail,  and  this  will  be found in the
appendix.</p>

<p> We do not delude ourselves that we have  said  the  last  word
about <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>. But we have for the first time sketched out at
least  some of the most salient features and gathered them into a

<p>CHAPTER 2 THE HITLER PROJECT</p>

<p>1. <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> Property Seized--Trading with the Enemy</p>

<p>In October 1942, ten months after entering World War II,  America
was  preparingits  first  assault against Nazi military forces.
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> was managing partner of  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>  BrothersHarriman.
His  18-year-old  son <ent type='person'>George</ent>, the future U.S. President, had just
begun training to become a naval pilot.</p>

<p> On October 20, 1942, the U.S.  government ordered the  seizure
of  Nazi  German  banking  operations in New York City which were
being conducted by <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>.</p>

<p> Under the {Trading with the Enemy Act},  the  government  took
over  the  {Union  Banking  Corporation,}  in  which  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  was a
director.  The U.S. Alien Property Custodian seized Union Banking
Corp.'s stock shares, all of which were owned by  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>,
E.  <ent type='person'>Roland</ent>  ``Bunny''  Harriman,  three  Nazi executives, and two
other associates of <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>.s1</p>

<p> The order seizing the bank  ``vest[ed]  [seized]  all  of  the
capital stock of Union  Banking  Corporation,  aNew  York
corporation,'' and named the holders of its shares as:</p>

<p> sb|``E.  <ent type='person'>Roland Harriman</ent>--3991 shares.'' Harriman was chairman
and director of Union Banking  Corp.  (UBC);  this  is``Bunny''
Harriman, described by <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> as a place holder who didn't
get  much  into  banking  affairs;  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> managed his personal
investments.</p>

<p> sb|``<ent type='person'>Cornelis Lievense</ent>--4 shares.'' Lievense was president and
director of UBC, and a New York resident banking functionary  for
the Nazis.</p>

<p> sb|``Harold D. Pennington--1 share.'' Pennington was treasurer
and  director  of  UBC, and an office manager employed by <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> at
<ent type='person'>Brown</ent> Brothers Harriman.</p>

<p> sb|``Ray <ent type='person'>Morris</ent>--1 share.'' <ent type='person'>Morris</ent> was director of UBC, anda
partner of <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> and the Harrimans.</p>

<p> sb|``<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  S.  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>--1  share.'' <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> was director of UBC,
which was co-founded and sponsored by  his  father-in-law  <ent type='person'>George</ent>
<ent type='person'>Walker</ent>; he was senior managing partner for E. <ent type='person'>Roland Harriman</ent> and
<ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman.</p>

<p> sb|``H.J. <ent type='person'>Kouwenhoven</ent>--1 share'' <ent type='person'>Kouwenhoven</ent> was director of
UBC; he organized  UBCas  the  emissary  of  Fritz  Thyssen  in
negotiations with <ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Walker</ent> and <ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman; he was also
managing  director  ofUBC's  Netherlands  affiliate  under Nazi
occ<ent type='person'>upa</ent>tion;  industrial  executive  inNazi  Germany,and  also
director  and  chief  foreign  financial  executive of the German
Steel Trust.</p>

<p> sb|``Johann G. Groeninger--1 share.'' Groeninger was  director
of  UBC  and  of  its Netherlands affiliate; he was an industrial
executive in Nazi Germany.</p>

<p> The order also specified: ``all of which shares areheld  for
the  benefit  of  ...  membersof  the  Thyssen family, [and] is
property of nationals ... of a designated enemy country....''</p>

<p>  By October 26, 1942, U.S.  troops  were  underway  for  North
Africa.  On  October 28, the government issued orders seizing two
Nazi front organizations  run  by  the<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>-Harriman  bank:  the
{Holland-American  Trading  Corporation}  and the {Seamless Steel
Equipment Corporation.}s2</p>

<p> U.S. forces landed under fire  nearAlgiers  on  November  8,
1942;  heavy  combat raged throughout November. Nazi interests in
the {Silesian-American Corporation,}  long  managed  by  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  and  <ent type='person'>hisfather</ent>-in-law  <ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Herbert</ent> <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>, were seized
under the Trading with the Enemy Act on  November  171942.  In
this  action,  the  government announced that it was seizing only
the Nazi interests, leaving the Nazis' U.S. partners to carry  on
the business.s3</p>

<p> These  and  other  actions  taken  by  the  U.S. government in
wartime were, tragically, too little and  too  late.President
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'sfamily had already played a central role in financing and
arming <ent type='person'>Adolf Hitler</ent> for his takeover of Germany; in financing and
managing the buildup of Nazi war industries for the  conquest  of
Europe and war against the U.S.A.; and in the development of Nazi
genocide  theories  and  racial propaganda, with their well-known
results.</p>

<p> The facts presented here must be known, and their implications
reflected upon, for a proper understanding  ofPresident  <ent type='person'>George</ent>
<ent type='person'>Herbert</ent>  <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  and  ofthe  danger  to  mankind  that he
represents.  The President's family fortune was largely a  result
of the<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>project.  The  powerful  Anglo-American  family
associations,  which  later  boosted him into the Central
Intelligence  Agency and up to the White House, were his father's
partners in the <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> project.</p>

<p> President <ent type='person'>Franklin Roosevelt</ent>'s Alien Property  Custodian,  Leo
T.  <ent type='person'>Crowley</ent>, signed Vesting Order Number 248 seizing the property
of <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  under  the Trading with Enemy Act.  The order,
published in obscure government record books and kept out of  the
news,s4 explained nothing about the Nazis involved; only that the
Union  BankingCorporation was run for the ``Thyssen family'' of
``Germany and/or Hungary''--``nationals ... of a designated enemy
country.''</p>

<p> By deciding that <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> and the other directors of  the
Union  BankingCorp. were legally {front men for the Nazis}, the
government avoided the more important historical issue:  In  what
way  {were <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s Nazis themselves hired, armed, and instructed
by} the New York and London clique of which <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> was  an
executive manager?  Let  us  examinethe  Harriman-<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>
project from the 1920s until it was partially broken up, to  seek
an answer for that question.</p>

<p>2. Origin and Extent of the Project</p>

<p> Fritz  Thyssen  andhis  business  partners  are  universally
recognized as the  most  important  German  financiersof  Adolf
<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s  takeover  ofGermany. At the time of the order seizing
the Thyssen family's Union Banking Corp., Mr. Fritz  Thyssen  had
already  published  his famous book, {I Paid <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>},s5 admitting
that he had financed <ent type='person'>Adolf Hitler</ent> and  the  Nazi  movement  since
October  1923.Thyssen's  role  as  the  leading early backer of
<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s grab for  power  in  Germany  had  been  noted  by  U.S.
diplomats in Berlin in 1932.s6 The order seizing the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>-Thyssen
bank  was  curiously  quiet  and modest about the identity of the
perpetrators who had been nailed.</p>

<p> Buttwo  weeks  before the official order, government
investigators  had  reported  secretly that ``W. <ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman
was in Europe sometime prior to 1924  and  at  that  time  became
acquainted with  Fritz  Thyssen,  the  German  industrialist.''
Harriman and Thyssen agreed to set up a bank for Thyssen  in  New
York.  ``[C]ertain  of[Harriman's]  associates  would  serve as
directors....'' Thyssen agent ``H.J.  <ent type='person'>Kouwenhoven</ent> ... came to the
United States ... prior to 1924 for conferences with the Harriman
Company in this connection....''s7</p>

<p> When exactly  was  ``Harriman  in  Europe  sometimeprior  to
1924''? In  fact, he was in Berlin in 1922 to set up the Berlin
branch of W.A. Harriman &amp; Co. under <ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>'s presidency.</p>

<p> The Union Banking  Corporation  wasestablished  formally  in
1924, as a unit in the Manhattan offices of W.A.  Harriman &amp; Co.,
interlocking with the  Thyssen-owned  {Bank  voor  Handel  en
Scheepvaart} (BHS)  inthe  Netherlands.   The investigators
concluded  that  ``theUnion  BankingCorporation has since its
inception handled funds chiefly supplied to it through the  Dutch
bank by the Thyssen interests for American investment.''</p>

<p> Thus  by personal agreement between <ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman and Fritz
Thyssen in  1922,  W.A.  Harriman  &amp;  Co.  (alias  Union  Banking
Corporation)  would  be transferring funds back and forth between
New York and the ``Thyssen interests'' in Germany. By putting  up
about  $400000,  the  Harriman organization would be joint owner
and manager of Thyssen's banking operations outside of Germany.</p>

<p> {How important was the Nazienterprise  for  whichPresident
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s father was the New York banker?}</p>

<p> The 1942 U.S. government investigative report said that <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s
Nazi-front  bank  was an interlocking concern with the Vereinigte
Stahlwerke (United  Steel  Works  Corporation  or  {German  Steel
Trust}) led  by  FritzThyssen  and his two brothers.After the
war, congressional investigators probed  the  Thyssen  interests,
Union Banking  Corp.  and  related Nazi units.The investigation
showed that the <ent type='person'>Vereinigte Stahlwerke</ent> had produced thefollowing
approximate  proportions of total German national output: ``50.8%
of Nazi Germany's pig iron; 41.4%  of  Nazi  Germany'suniversal
plate;36.0%  of  Nazi  Germany's  heavy  plate;  38.5%  of Nazi
Germany's galvanized sheet; 45.5% of  Nazi  Germany's  pipes  and
tubes;22.1%  of  Nazi  Germany's  wire; 35.0% of Nazi Germany's
explosives.''s8</p>

<p> This accounts for many, many Nazi submarines,  bombs,  rifles,
gas chambers, etc.</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> became vice president of W.A. Harriman &amp; Co. in
1926. That same year, a friend of Harriman  and  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  set  <ent type='person'>upa</ent>
giant  new  organization  for  their  client <ent type='person'>Fritz Thyssen</ent>, prime
sponsor of politician <ent type='person'>Adolf Hitler</ent>. The new {German Steel Trust,}
Germany's largest industrial corporation, was organized  in  1926
by Wall Street banker <ent type='person'>Clarence Dillon</ent>. <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent> was the old comrade
of  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  father  Sam  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  from  the ``Merchants of
Death'' bureau in World War I.</p>

<p> In  return  for  putting  up  $70  millionto create his
organization, majority owner Thyssen gave the <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent> Read company
two  or  more  representativeson  the  boardof  the new Steel
Trust.s9</p>

<p> Thus there is a division of labor: Thyssen's own  confidential
accounts,  forpolitical  and related purposes, were run through
the <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>-<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> organization; the Steel Trust did  itscorporate
banking through <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent> Read.</p>

<p> The<ent type='person'>Walker</ent>-<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  firm's  banking  activities  werenot  just
politically  neutral  money-making  ventures  which  happened  to
coincide  withthe  aims  of  German  Nazis.  All  of the firm's
European  business in those days was organized around
anti-democratic political forces.</p>

<p> In  1927,  criticism of their support for totalitarianism drew
this retort from  Bert<ent type='person'>Walker</ent>,  written  fromKennebunkport  to
<ent type='person'>Averell</ent>  Harriman:  ``It  seems  to  me  that  the  suggestion in
connection with Lord  <ent type='person'>Bearsted</ent>'s  views  that  we  withdraw  from
Russia smacks  somewhat  of  the impertinent....  I think that we
have drawn our line and should hew to it.''s1s0</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman met with  Italy's  fascistdictator,  Benito
<ent type='person'>Mussolini</ent>.  A representative of the firm subsequently telegraphed
good news back to his chief executive <ent type='person'>Bert Walker</ent>:  ``...  During
these  last  days ... <ent type='person'>Mussolini</ent> ... has examined and approved our
c[o]ntract 15 June.''s1s1</p>

<p> Thegreat  financial  collapse  of1929-31  shook America,
Germany, and  Britain,weakening  all governments.  It also made
the hard-pressed <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> even more willing to  do  whatever
was necessary  to  retain  his new place in the world.It was in
this  crisis  that  certain  Anglo-Americans  determined  on  the
installation of a <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> regime in Germany.</p>

<p> W.A.  Harriman  &amp; Co., well-positioned for this enterprise and
rich in assets from their German  and  Russianbusiness,  merged
with  the  British-American  investment house, <ent type='person'>Brown</ent> Brothers, on
January 1, 1931.  <ent type='person'>Bert Walker</ent> retired to his own G.H.<ent type='person'>Walker</ent>&amp;
Co.  This left the Harriman brothers, <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>, and <ent type='person'>Thatcher</ent>
M.  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent> as the  senior  partners  ofthe  new  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>  Brothers
Harriman firm.  (The London, England branch of the <ent type='person'>Brown</ent> family
firm  continued  operating  under its historic name--<ent type='person'>Brown</ent>,
Shipley.)</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Robert</ent>  A.  <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent>  also  came  over  as  a partner from <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>
Brothers. His father, E.H. Harriman's lawyer and railroad  chief,
had  been  on  the  War  Industries Board with <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>'s father.
Though he remained a partner  in  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>  Brothers  Harriman,  the
junior<ent type='person'>Lovett</ent>soon  replacedhis father as chief exexcutive of
Union Pacific Railroad.</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Brown</ent> Brothers had a racial tradition that fitted it well  for
the <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>  project. American patriots had cursed its name back
in Civil War days.  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent> Brothers, with offices  in  the  U.S.A.
and  in  England,  had carried on their ships fully 75 percent of
the slave cotton from the American South  overto  British  mill
owners; through  their  usurious  credit  they  controlled  and
manipulated the slave-owners.</p>

<p> Now, in 1931, the virtual dictator of world finance,  Bank  of
England  Governor  Montagu  Collet  <ent type='person'>Norman</ent>,  was  a  former <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>
Brothers partner,  whose  grandfather  had  been  bossof  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>
Brothers during  the U.S. Civil War.  Montagu <ent type='person'>Norman</ent> was known as
the most  avidof  <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s  supporters  within  British  ruling
circles,  and  <ent type='person'>Norman</ent>'s  intimacy with this firm was essential to
his management of the <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> project.</p>

<p> In 1931, while <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> ran the New York office of  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>
Brothers Harriman,  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>'s  partner  wasMontagu  <ent type='person'>Norman</ent>'s
intimate friend <ent type='person'>Thatcher</ent> <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>. The Bank of England chief  always
stayedat  the home of <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>'s partner on his hush-hush trips
to New York. <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  concentrated  on  the  firm's  German
actitivites,  and  <ent type='person'>Thatcher</ent>  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>  saw  to their business in old
England, under the guidance of his mentor Montagu <ent type='person'>Norman</ent>.s1s2</p>

<p>3. <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s Ladder to Power</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Adolf Hitler</ent> became Chancellor of Germany  January  30,  1933,
and absolute dictator in March 1933, after two years of expensive
and violent  lobbying  and electioneering.  Two affiliates of the
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>-Harriman organization played great parts  in  this  criminal
undertaking:Thyssen's  German  Steel Trust;and the
Hamburg-Amerika Line and several of its executives.s1s3</p>

<p> Letus  look  moreclosely  at  the  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>family's German
partners.</p>

<p> {Fritz  Thyssen} told Allied interrogators after the war about
some of his financial support for the Nazi Party:  ``In  1930  or
1931 ...  I  told  [<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s  deputy  <ent type='person'>Rudolph</ent>]Hess ...  I would
arrange a credit for him with a Dutch bank in Rotterdam, the Bank
fuaur Handel und Schiff [i.e. Bank  voor  Handel  en  Scheepvaart
(BHS), the  Harriman-<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  affiliate].I arranged the credit ...
he would pay it back in three years....  I  chose  a  Dutch  bank
because  I  did  not  want to be mixed up with German banks in my
position, and because I thought it was better to do business with
a Dutch bank, and I thought I would have the Nazis a little  more
in my hands....</p>

<p> ``The credit was about 250-300000 [gold] marks--about the sum
I had  given  before. The  loan has been repaid in part to the
Dutch bank, but I think some money is still owing on it....''s1s4</p>

<p> The overall total of Thyssen's political donations  and  loans
to  the Nazis was well over a million dollars, including funds he
raised from others--in a period  of  terrible  money-shortage  in
Germany.</p>

<p> {Friedrich  <ent type='person'>Flick</ent>}  was the major co-owner of the German Steel
Trust with <ent type='person'>Fritz Thyssen</ent>,  Thyssen's  longtimecollaborator  and
sometime competitor. In preparation for the war crimes tribunal
at Nuremberg, the U.S.government said that <ent type='person'>Flick</ent> was``one  of
leading  financiers  and industrialists who from 1932 contributed
large sums to the Nazi Party ... member of `Circle of Friends' of
<ent type='person'>Himmler</ent> who contributed large sums to the SS.''s1s5</p>

<p>  <ent type='person'>Flick</ent>, like Thyssen, financed the Nazis to  maintain  their
private  armies  called  Schutzstaffel (S.S. or Black Shirts) and
Sturmabteilung (S.A., storm troops or <ent type='person'>Brown</ent> Shirts).</p>

<p> The <ent type='person'>Flick</ent>-Harriman  partnership  was  directly  supervised  by
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>,  President  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  father, and by <ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>,
President <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s grandfather.</p>

<p> The Harriman-<ent type='person'>Walker</ent> Union Banking Corp. arrangements  for  the
GermanSteel  Trust had made them bankers for <ent type='person'>Flick</ent> and his vast
operations in Germany by no later than 1926.</p>

<p> The {Harriman Fifteen Corporation} (<ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>,  president,
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>and  <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>  Harriman,  sole  directors)  held a
substantial stake in the Silesian Holding Co. at the time of  the
merger with  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>  Brothers,  January1,  1931.  This holding
correlated to <ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman's chairmanshipof  the
{Consolidated  Silesian  SteelCorporation,}  the American group
owning one-third of a complex  of  steelmaking,  coal-mining  and
zinc-mining  activities in Germany and Poland, in which Friedrich
<ent type='person'>Flick</ent> owned two-thirds.s1s6</p>

<p>  The Nuremberg prosecutor characterized <ent type='person'>Flick</ent> as follows:</p>

<p> ``Proprietor  and  head  ofa  large  group of industrial
enterprises (coal and iron mines, steel producing and fabricating
plants) ...  `<ent type='person'>Wehrwirtschaftsfuehrer</ent>,'  1938[title awarded to
prominent industrialists for merit in armaments  drive--`Military
Economy Leader']....''s1s7</p>

<p> Forthis  buildup of the <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> war machine with coal, steel,
and arms production, using slave laborers,  the  Nazi  <ent type='person'>Flick</ent>  was
condemned  to  seven  years in prison at the Nuremberg trials; he
served three years.  With  friends  in  New  York  and  London,
however, <ent type='person'>Flick</ent> lived into the 1970s and died a billionaire.</p>

<p> On  March 19, 1934, <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>--then director of the German
Steel Trust's Union Banking Corporation--initiated  analert  to
the  absent  <ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman about a problem which had developed
in the <ent type='person'>Flick</ent> partnership.s1s8 <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> sent Harriman a clipping  from
the  {New York Times} of that day, which reported that the Polish
government  was  fighting  back  against  American and German
stockholders  who  controlled ``Poland's largest industrial unit,
the Upper Silesian Coal and Steel Company....''</p>

<p> The {Times} article continued: ``The  company  has  long  been
accused of mismanagement,excessive  borrowing,  fictitious
bookkeeping and gambling in securities.  Warrants were issued  in
December for  several  directors  accused  of tax evasions.  They
were German citizens and they fled.  They were replaced by Poles.
Herr <ent type='person'>Flick</ent>, regarding this as an attempt to  make  thecompany's
board  entirely  Polish,  retaliated by restricting credits until
the  new  Polish  directors  were  unable  to  pay  the workmen
regularly.''</p>

<p> The{Times} noted that the company's mines and mills ``employ
25000 men and account for 45 percent  of  Poland's  total  steel
output and  12 percent of her coal production.Two-thirds of the
company's stock is owned by Friedrich  <ent type='person'>Flick</ent>,  a  leading  German
steel  industrialist,  and the remainder is owned by interests in
the United States.''</p>

<p> In view of the fact that a great deal  of  Polish  output  was
being  exported  to <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s Germany under depression conditions,
the Polish government thought that <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>, Harriman, and their Nazi
partners  should  at  least  pay  fulltaxes  on  their Polish
holdings. The  U.S.  and  Nazi owners responded with a lockout.
The letter to Harriman in Washington reported a cable from  their
European  representative:  ``Have  undertaken  new  steps  London
Berlin...  please  establishfriendly  relations  with  Polish
Ambassador [in Washington].''</p>

<p> A  1935  Harriman  Fifteen Corporation memo from <ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>
announced an agreement had been made ``in  Berlin''  to  sell  an
8000  block  of their shares in Consolidated Silesian Steel.s1s9
But the dispute with Poland did not deter the  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  family  from
continuing its partnership with <ent type='person'>Flick</ent>.</p>

<p> Nazi  tanksand  bombs ``settled'' this dispute in September,
1939 with the invasion of Poland, beginning  World  War  II.  The
Nazi army had been equipped by <ent type='person'>Flick</ent>, Harriman, <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>, and <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>,
with materials essentially stolen from Poland.</p>

<p> There were  probably  fewpeopleat  the  time  who  could
appreciate the irony, that when the  Soviets  also  attacked  and
invaded  Poland  from the East, their vehicles were fueled by oil
pumpedfrom  Baku  wells  revived  bythe  Harriman/<ent type='person'>Walker</ent>/<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
enterprise.</p>

<p> Three  years later, nearly a year after the Japanese attack on
Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government  ordered  the  seizure  of  the
Nazis'share  in  theSilesian-American  Corporationunder the
Trading with the Enemy Act. Enemy nationals were said to  own  49
percent  of  the  common stock and 41.67 percent of the preferred
stock of the company.</p>

<p> The order characterized the company as a ``business enterprise
within the United States, owned by [a front company  in]  Zurich,
Switzerland,  and  held  for the benefit of Bergwerksgesellschaft
<ent type='person'>George</ent> von Giesche's <ent type='person'>Erben</ent>, a German corporation....''s2s0</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Bert Walker</ent> was still the  senior  directorof  the  company,
which  he  hadfounded  back  in  1926  simultaneously  with the
creation of  the  German  Steel  Trust.  Ray  <ent type='person'>Morris</ent>,  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>'s
partner from Union Banking Corp. and <ent type='person'>Brown</ent> Brothers Harriman, was
also a director.</p>

<p> Theinvestigative  report  prior  to the government crackdown
explained the ``NATURE OF BUSINESS: The subject corporation is an
American holding company  for  German  and  Polish  subsidiaries,
which  own  large  andvaluable  coal and zinc mines in Silesia,
Poland and Germany. Since September 1939, these  properties  have
been  in  the  possession of and have been operated by the German
government and have undoubtedly been of  considerable  assistance
to that country in its war effort.''s2s1</p>

<p> Thereportnoted  that  the  American  stockholders hoped to
regain control of the European properties after the war.</p>

<p>4. Control of Nazi Commerce</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Bert Walker</ent> had arranged the credits Harriman needed  to  take
control  of  the  Hamburg-Amerika  Line  back in 1920. <ent type='person'>Walker</ent> had
organized the {American Ship and Commerce Corp.} as a unit of the
W.A.Harriman &amp; Co., with contractual  power  over
Hamburg-Amerika's affairs.</p>

<p> As  the  <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>  project  went  into  high gear, Harriman-<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
shares in American Ship and  Commerce  Corp.  were  held  by  the
Harriman Fifteen Corp., run by <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> and <ent type='person'>Bert Walker</ent>.s2s2</p>

<p> It  was  a  convenient  stroll  for the well-tanned, athletic,
handsome  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>.  From  the  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent> Brothers Harriman
skyscraper  at59  Wall  Street--where  he  was  senior managing
partner, confidential investments manager and advisor to  <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>
and  his  brother  ``Bunny''--he  walked  across  to the Harriman
Fifteen Corporation at One Wall Street, otherwise known  as  G.H.
<ent type='person'>Walker</ent>&amp; Co.--and around the corner to his subsidiary offices at
39 Broadway, former home of the old  W.A.  Harriman  &amp;Co.,  and
still  the  offices  for  American  Ship and Commerce, and of the
Union Banking Corporation.</p>

<p> In many ways, <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s Hamburg-Amerika Line was  the  pivot  for
the entire <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> project.</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>  Harriman  and <ent type='person'>Bert Walker</ent> had gained control over the
steamship company in 1920 in negotiations with its post-World War
I chief executive, {<ent type='person'>Wilhelm Cuno</ent>}, and with the  line's  bankers,
M.M.  Warburg.<ent type='person'>Cuno</ent>  was  thereafter completely dependent on the
Anglo-Americans,  and  became  a  member  of the Anglo-German
Friendship Society.In the 1930-32  drive  fora  <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>
dictatorship, <ent type='person'>Wilhelm Cuno</ent> contributed important sums to the Nazi
Party.s2s3</p>

<p> {<ent type='person'>Albert Voegler</ent>} was  chiefexecutive  of  the  Thyssen-<ent type='person'>Flick</ent>
GermanSteel  Trust for which <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s Union Banking Corp. was the
New York office.  He was a director  of  the  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>-affiliate  BHS
Bank in Rotterdam, and  a  director  of  the  Harriman-<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
Hamburg-Amerika Line. <ent type='person'>Voegler</ent> joined Thyssen and <ent type='person'>Flick</ent>in  their
heavy  1930-33Nazi contributions, and helped organize the final
Nazi leap into national power.s2s4</p>

<p> The {<ent type='person'>Schroeder</ent>} family of bankers was a linchpin for the  Nazi
activities  ofHarriman and <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>, closely tied to their
lawyers <ent type='person'>Allen</ent> and <ent type='person'>John Foster</ent> Dulles.</p>

<p> Baron Kurt  von  <ent type='person'>Schroeder</ent>  was  co-director  of  the  massive
Thyssen-Huettefoundry  alongwith  <ent type='person'>Johann Groeninger</ent>, <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s New York bank partner.  <ent type='person'>Kurt von Schroeder</ent>  wastreasurer
of  the support organization for the Nazi Party's private armies,
to which <ent type='person'>Friedrich Flick</ent> contributed.Kurt  von  <ent type='person'>Schroeder</ent>  and
Montagu  <ent type='person'>Norman</ent>'s  proteaageaa<ent type='person'>Hjalmar Schacht</ent> together made the
final arrangments for <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> to enter the government.s2s5</p>

<p> Baron <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Rudolph</ent> von <ent type='person'>Schroeder</ent></ent> was vice president and director of
the Hamburg-Amerika Line. Long an  intimate  contact  of  <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>
Harriman's  inGermany,  Baron  <ent type='person'>Rudolph</ent>  sent his grandson Baron
Johann <ent type='person'>Rudolph</ent> for a  tour  of<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>  Brothers
Harriman offices in New York City in December 1932--on the eve of
their <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>-triumph.s2s6</p>

<p> Certain  actions  taken directly by the Harriman-<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> shipping
line in 1932 must be ranked among the gravest acts of treason  in
this century.</p>

<p> TheU.S.  Embassy  in Berlin reported back to Washington that
the ``costly election campaigns'' and ``the cost of maintaining a
private army of 300000 to 400000 men'' had raised questions  as
to theNazis'financial backers.  The constitutional government
of the German  republic  movedto  defend  national  freedom  by
ordering the  Nazi  Party  private  armies  disbanded. The U.S.
Embassy reported that the {Hamburg-Amerika  Line  was  purchasing
and distributing propaganda attacks against the  German
government, for attempting this last-minute crackdown on <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s
forces.}s2s7</p>

<p> Thousands of  German  opponents  of<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>ism  were  shot  or
intimidated  by  privately  armed  Nazi  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>Shirts.  In  this
connection, we note that  the  original  ``Merchant  of  Death,''
Samuel<ent type='person'>Pryor</ent>,was a founding director of both the Union Banking
Corp. and the American Ship and Commerce Corp.Since  Mr.  <ent type='person'>Pryor</ent>
was  executive committee chairman of Remington Arms and a central
figure in the world's private arms traffic, his use to the <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>
project was enhanced as the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> family's partner in  Nazi  Party
banking and trans-Atlantic shipping.</p>

<p> TheU.S.  Senate  arms-traffic investigators probed Remington
after it was joined in a cartel agreement on  explosives  to  the
Nazi firm  I.G.  Farben.  Looking  at  the period leading up to
<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s seizure of  power,  the  senators  found  that  ``German
political  associations, like the Nazi and others, are nearly all
armed with American ...  guns....  Arms of all kinds coming  from
America  are  transshipped  in the Scheldt to river barges before
the vessels arrive in Antwerp. They then can be  carried  through
Holland without police inspectionor interference.  The
<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>ists and Communists  arepresumed  to  get  arms  in  this
manner. The  principal  armscomingfrom America are Thompson
submachine guns and revolvers.The number is great.''s2s8</p>

<p> The beginning  of  the  <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>  regime  brought  some  bizarre
changes to the Hamburg-Amerika Line--and more betrayals.</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s American Ship and Commerce Corp. notified <ent type='person'>Max</ent>
Warburg of Hamburg, Germany, on March 7, 1933, that  Warburg  was
to  bethe  corporation's official, designated representative on
the board of Hamburg-Amerika.s2s9</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Max Warburg</ent> replied on March 27, 1933, assuring  his  American
sponsors  thatthe <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> government was good for Germany: ``For
the last few years business was considerably better than  we  had
anticipated,  but  a  reactionis  making  itself  felt for some
months.  We are actually suffering also  underthe  very  active
propaganda against Germany, caused bysome unpleasant
circumstances.These occurrences were the natural consequence of
the very excited  election  campaign,  but  were  extraordinarily
exaggerated inthe  foreign  press.The  Government is firmly
resolved to maintain public peace and order  in  Germany,  andI
feel  perfectly  convinced in this respect that there is no cause
for any alarm whatsoever.''s3s0</p>

<p> This seal of approval for <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>, coming from  a  famous  Jew,
was  just  what  Harriman and <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> required, for they anticipated
rather serious ``alarm'' inside the  U.S.A.  against  their  Nazi
operations.</p>

<p> On  March  29,  1933, two days after <ent type='person'>Max</ent>'s letter to Harriman,
<ent type='person'>Max</ent>'s son <ent type='person'>Erich</ent> sent a cable to his cousin Frederick M.  Warburg,
a director  ofthe Harriman railroad system.  He asked Frederick
to ``use all your influence'' to stop all anti-Nazi  activity  in
America,  including  ``atrocity news and unfriendly propaganda in
foreign press, mass meetings, etc.''  Frederick  cabled  back  to
<ent type='person'>Erich</ent>: ``No responsible groups here [are] urging [a] boycott [of]
Germangoods[,]  merely  excited  individuals.''  Two days after
that,  On  March  31,  1933,  the  {American-Jewish Committee,}
controlled  bythe  <ent type='person'>Warburgs</ent>,and  the  {B'nai B'rith,} heavily
influenced by the  <ent type='person'>Sulzbergers</ent>'  ({NewYork  Times}),issueda
formal,  official  joint  statement  of  the  two  organizations,
counselling  ``that  no  American  boycott  against  Germany be
encouraged,  [and  advising] ... that no further mass meetings be
held or similar forms of agitation be employed.''s3s1</p>

<p> The American Jewish Committee and the B'nai B'rith (mother  of
the  ``Anti-DefamationLeague'')  continued  with this hardline,
no-attack-on-<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> stance all through the  1930s,  blunting  the
fight mounted by many Jews and other anti-fascists.</p>

<p> Thus  the  decisive interchange reproduced above, taking place
entirely within the orbit of the Harriman/<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> firm, may  explain
something  of  the relationship of <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> to American Jewish
and Zionist leaders.  Some of them, in close cooperation with his
family, played an ugly part in the drama of Naziism. Is this  why
``professionalNazi-hunters'' have never discovered how the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
family made its money?</p>

<p> The executive board of the {HamburgAmerika  Line}{(Hapag)}
met  jointly with the North German Lloyd company board in Hamburg
on September 5, 1933. Under official Nazi  supervision,  the  two
firms were  merged.  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s American Ship and Commerce
Corp.installed  Christian  J.  Beck, a longtime Harriman
executive,  as manager of freight and operations in North America
for  the  new  joint  Nazi  shipping  lines  {(Hapag-Lloyd)})  on
November 4, 1933.</p>

<p> According  to  testimony  of officials of the companies before
Congress in 1934, a supervisor from the {Nazi Labor  Front}  rode
with  every  ship of the Harriman-<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> line; employees of the New
York offices were directly organized into the  Nazi  Labor  Front
organization; Hamburg-Amerika provided free passage to
individuals going abroad for Nazi propaganda  purposes;  and  the
line subsidized pro-Nazi newspapers in the U.S.A., as it had done
in Germany against the constitutional German government.s3s2</p>

<p> In  mid-1936, <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s American Ship and Commerce Corp.
cabled M.M. Warburg, asking Warburg torepresent  thecompany's
heavyshareinterest atthe  forthcoming  Hamburg-Amerika
stockholders meeting. The  Warburg  office  repliedwith  the
information  that  ``we  represented  you''  at  the stockholders
meeting and ``exercised on your behalf your voting power  for  Rm
[gold marks] 3509600 Hapag stock deposited with us.''</p>

<p> The <ent type='person'>Warburgs</ent> transmitted a  letter  received  from  Emil
<ent type='person'>Helfferich</ent>, German chief executive of both Hapag-Lloyd and of the
Standard Oil subsidiary in Nazi Germany: ``It is the intention to
continue the relations with Mr.  Harriman on the  samebasis  as
heretofore....''  In  a  colorful  gesture, Hapag's Nazi chairman
<ent type='person'>Helfferich</ent> sent the line's president across  the  Atlantic  ona
Zeppelin to confer with their New York string-pullers.</p>

<p> After the meeting with theZeppelin  passenger,  the
Harriman-<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> office replied: ``I  am  glad  to  learnthat  Mr.
<ent type='person'>Hellferich</ent>  [sic]  hasstated that relations between the Hamburg
American Line and ourselves will be continued on the  same  basis
as heretofore.''s3s3</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Twomonthsbefore</ent> moving against <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s Union Banking Corp.,
the U.S.  government ordered the seizure of all property  of  the
Hamburg-Amerika  Line  and  North German Lloyd, under the Trading
with the Enemy Act. The investigators noted  in  the  pre-seizure
reportthat  Christian  J.  Beck was still acting as an attorney
representing the Nazi firm.s3s4</p>

<p> In May 1933, just after the <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> regime was consolidated, an
agreement was reached in Berlin for the coordination of all  Nazi
commerce with the U.S.A. The {Harriman International Co.,} led by
<ent type='person'>Averell</ent>  Harriman's  first cousin <ent type='person'>Oliver</ent>, was to head a syndicate
of 150 firms  and  individuals,  to  conduct  {all  exports  from
<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s Germany to the United States}.s3s5</p>

<p> This  pact  had  been  negotiated  in  Berlin between <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s
economics minister, Hjalmar  Schacht,  and  <ent type='person'>John</ent>  Foster  Dulles,
international  attorney  for dozens of Nazi enterprises, with the
counsel of <ent type='person'>Max Warburg</ent> and <ent type='person'>Kurt von Schroeder</ent>.</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>John Foster</ent> Dulles would later be U.S. Secretary of State, and
the great power in the Republican Party of  the  1950s.  Foster's
friendship  and  that  of  his brother <ent type='person'>Allen</ent> (head of the Central
Intelligence Agency), greatly aided <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> to  become  the
Republican  U.S.  senator  from  Connecticut. And it was to be of
inestimable value to <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>, in his ascent to the heights of
``covert action government,'' that both of these Dulles  brothers
were the lawyers for the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> family's far-flung enterprise.</p>

<p> Throughoutthe  1930s,  <ent type='person'>John</ent>  Foster  Dulles  arranged  debt
restructuring for German firms under a series of  decrees  issued
by  <ent type='person'>Adolf Hitler</ent>. In these deals, Dulles struck a balance between
the interest owed to selected, larger investors, and the needs of
the growing Nazi warmaking apparatus for producing tanks,  poison
gas, etc.</p>

<p> Dulles  wrote  to  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent><ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  in 1937 concerning one such
arrangement.  The  German-Atlantic  Cable  Company,  owning  Nazi
Germany's  only  telegraph channel to the United States, had made
debt and management  agreements  with  the  <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>-Harriman  bank
during the  1920s.  A new decree would now void those agreements,
which  had  originallybeen  reached  with  non-Nazicorporate
officials. Dulles  asked  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>,  whomanaged these affairs for
<ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman, to get <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>'s signature on a letter to  Nazi
officials, agreeing to the changes.  Dulles wrote:</p>

<p>``Sept.  22,  1937
``Mr.  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> S. <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
``59 Wall Street, New
  York, N.Y.</p>

<p> ``Dear Press,
 ``I have looked over the letter of the  German-American  [sic]
Cable  Companyto  <ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman.... It would appear that the
only rights in the matter are those which inure  in  the  bankers
and  that  no  legal  embarrassment  would  result, so far as the
bondholders  are  concerned,  by your acquiescence in the
modification of the bankers' agreement.
 ``Sincerely yours,
 ``<ent type='person'>John Foster</ent> Dulles''</p>

<p> Dulles  enclosed  aproposed draft reply, <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> got Harriman's
signature, and the changes went through.s3s6</p>

<p> In conjunction with these arrangements,  the  German  Atlantic
Cable  Companyattempted to stop payment on its debts to smaller
American bondholders.  The money  was  to  be  used  instead  for
arming the Nazi state, under a decree of the <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> government.</p>

<p> Despite  the busy efforts of <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> and Dulles, a New York court
decided that this particular <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> ``law'' was  invalid  in  the
UnitedStates;  smallbondholders, not parties to deals between
the bankers and the Nazis, were entitled to get paid.s3s7</p>

<p> In this anda  fewother  of  theattempted  swindles,  the
intended victims  <ent type='person'>cameout</ent>  with  their  money.  But  the Nazi
financial and political reorganization went ahead to  its  tragic
climax.</p>

<p> Forhis part in the <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> revolution, <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> was paid
a fortune.</p>

<p> This is the legacy he left to his son, President <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>.</p>

<p>Chapter  3  RACE  HYGIENE:  Three  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  Family  Alliances  ``The
[government] must put  the  most  modern  medical  means  in  the
service of  this  knowledge....  Those  who  are physically and
mentally  unhealthy  and  unworthy  must  not  perpetuate their
suffering in  the  body  of their children....The prevention of
the faculty and opportunity toprocreate  on  the  part  of  the
physically  degenerateand  mentally sick, over a period of only
600  years,  would  ...  free  humanity  froman immeasurable
misfortune.''s1</p>

<p> ``The  per  capita  income  gap  between the developed and the
developing countries is increasing, in large part the  result  of
higher birth  rates in the poorer countries....  Famine in India,
unwanted babies in the United States, poverty that seemed to form
an unbreakable chain for millions of people--how should we tackle
these problems?....  It is quite clearthat  one  of  the  major
challenges  ofthe  1970s  ...  will  be  to  curb  the  world's
fertility.''</p>

<p>These two quotations are alike in their mock show of concern  for
human  suffering, and in their cynical remedy for it: Big Brother
must  prevent  the  ``unworthy''  or  ``unwanted''  people from
living.
 Letus  now further inquire into the family background of our
President, so as to help illustrate how the second quoted author,
{<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>}s1 came to share the outlook of  the  first,  {Adolf
<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>}.s2
 We  shall  examine  here  the alliance of the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> family with
three other families: {<ent type='person'>Farish</ent>, Draper} and {Gray.}
 The private associations among these families have led to  the
President's relationship  tohis  closest,  most  confidential
advisers.  These alliances were  forged  in  the  earlier  <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>
project and  its  immediate  aftermath. Understanding them will
help us to explain <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  obsession  with  the  supposed
overpopulation of the world's non-Anglo-Saxons, and the dangerous
means he has adopted to deal with this ``problem.''</p>

<p><ent type='person'>Bush</ent> and <ent type='person'>Farish</ent></p>

<p> When  <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  was  elected vice president in 1980, Texas
mystery man <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>William</ent> Stamps <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> III</ent> took over management of all
of <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>'s personal wealth in a ``blind trust.''Known  as
one  of  the richest men in Texas, <ent type='person'>Will Farish</ent> keeps his business
affairs under the most intense secrecy.  Only the source  of  his
immense wealth is known, not its employment.s3
 <ent type='person'>Will Farish</ent> has long  been  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  closest  friend  and
confidante.  He is also the  unique  private  host  toBritain's
Queen <ent type='person'>Elizabeth</ent>: <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> owns and boards the studs which mate with
the Queen's  mares. That is her public rationale when she comes
to America and stays in <ent type='person'>Farish</ent>'s house.  It is a  vital  link  in
the mind of our Anglophile President.
 President  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  can count on <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> not to betray the violent
secrets surrounding the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> family  money.  For  <ent type='person'>Farish</ent>'s  own
familyfortune  was  made  inthe  same  <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>  project,  in a
nightmarish partnership with <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>'s father.</p>

<p> On March 25, 1942, U.S.  Assistant  Attorney  General  Thurman
<ent type='person'>Arnold</ent>announced  that <ent type='person'>William</ent> Stamps <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> (grandfather of the
President's money manager) had pleaded ``no contest'' to  charges
of  criminal  conspiracy with the Nazis. <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> was the principal
manager of a worldwide cartel between StandardOil  Co.  of  New
Jersey and  the  I.G.  Farben concern.The merged enterprise had
opened the Auschwitz slave  labor  camp  on  June  141940,  to
produce artificial  rubber  and  gasoline  from coal.  The <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>
government supplied political opponents and Jews as  the  slaves,
who were worked to near death and then murdered.
 <ent type='person'>Arnold</ent>  disclosed that Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known
as Exxon), of which <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> was president and chief executive, had
agreedto  stop  hiding  fromthe  United  States  patents  for
artificial rubber which the company had provided to the Nazis.s4
 A  Senate  investigating  committeeunder Senator (later U.S.
President) <ent type='person'>Harry Truman</ent> of Missouri had called <ent type='person'>Arnold</ent> to  testify
at  hearings  on  corporations' collaboration with the Nazis. The
Senators  expressed  outrage  at  the  cynicalway  <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> was
continuing an alliance with the <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> regime that had begun back
in  1933,  when <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> became chief of Jersey Standard. Didn't he
know there was a war on?
 The Justice Department laid before  the  committee  a  letter,
written  to  Standard  president  <ent type='person'>Farish</ent>  by  his vice president,
shortly after the beginning of World War II (September1,  1939)
in  Europe.  The  letter  concerned  arenewal  of their earlier
agreements with the Nazis:</p>

<p>Report on  European  Trip  Oct.  12,  1939  Mr.  W.S.  <ent type='person'>Farish</ent>  30
Rockefeller Plaza</p>

<p> Dear Mr. <ent type='person'>Farish</ent>:
  ...  I stayed in France until Sept. 17th.... In England I met
by appointment the Royal Dutch [Shell  Oil  Co.]  gentlemen  from
Holland, and ... a general agreement was reached on the necessary
changes  in  our relations with the I.G. [Farben], in view of the
state of war....  [T]he Royal Dutch Shell  group  is  essentially
British....  Ialso  had several meetings with ... the [British]
Air Ministry....
 I required help to obtain the necessary permission  to  go  to
Holland....  After  discussions  with  the  [American] Ambassador
[<ent type='person'>Joseph</ent> <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent>] the situation was cleared  completely....  The
gentlemen  in  the Air Ministry ... very kindly offered to assist
me [later] in reentering England....
 Pursuant  to  thesearrangements,  I  was  able  to  keep  my
appointments  in  Holland  [having flown there on a British Royal
Air Force bomber], where I had three days of discussion with  the
representatives  of I.G. They delivered to me assignments of some
2000 foreign patents and {we did our best to work  out  complete
plans for a modus vivendi which could operate through the term of
the war, whether or not the U.S. came in....} [emphasis added]
 Very truly yours, F[rank] A.  Howards5</p>

<p> Here  are  some cold realities behind the tragedy of World War
II, which help explain the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>-<ent type='person'>Farish</ent> family alliance--and their
peculiar closeness to the Queen of England:
 sb|Shell  Oil  is  principally  owned  by  the  British  Royal
family. Shell's  chairman,  Sir <ent type='person'>Henri Deterding</ent>, helped sponsor
<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s rise to power,s6 by arrangement with the Royal  Family's
Bank  of  England  Governor, Montagu <ent type='person'>Norman</ent>. Their ally, Standard
Oil, would take part in  the  <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>  project  right  up  to  the
bloody, gruesome end.
 sb|When  grandfather  <ent type='person'>Farish</ent>  signed  the Justice Department's
consent decree in March 1942, the government had already  started
picking its way through the tangled web of world-monopoly oil and
chemical  agreements  between  Standard  Oil  and the Nazis. Many
patents and other Nazi-owned aspects of the partnership had  been
seized by the U.S. Alien Property Custodian.
 Uncle  Sam  would  not  seize  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  Union Banking
Corporation for another seven months.
 The <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>-<ent type='person'>Farish</ent> axis had begun back in 1929. In that year, the
Harriman bank bought <ent type='person'>Dresser</ent> Industries, supplier of oil-pipeline
couplers to Standard and other companies.  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> became a
director and financialczar  of  <ent type='person'>Dresser</ent>,  installinghis  Yale
classmate <ent type='person'>Neil Mallon</ent> as chairman.s7 <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> would later name
one of his sons after the <ent type='person'>Dresser</ent> executive.
 <ent type='person'>William</ent> S. <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> was the main organizer of the Humble Oil Co.
of  Texas,  which  <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> merged into the Standard Oil Company of
New Jersey. <ent type='person'>Farish</ent>  built  up  the  Humble-Standard  empire  of
pipelines and refineries in Texas.s8
 Thestock  market crashed just after the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> family got into
the oil business.  The world financial crisis led to  the  merger
of  the  <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>-Harriman bank with <ent type='person'>Brown</ent> Brothers in 1931. Former
<ent type='person'>Brown</ent> partner Montagu <ent type='person'>Norman</ent> and his protege <ent type='person'>Hjalmar Schacht</ent>, who
was to become <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s economics minister, paid frantic visits to
New York that year and the next, preparing the new <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>  regime
for Germany.</p>

<p>The Congress on Eugenics</p>

<p> The mostimportant American  political  <ent type='person'>eventin</ent>  those
preparations for <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>  was  the  infamous  Third  International
Congress  on  Eugenics,  held  at  NewYork's American Museum of
Natural  History  August 21-23, 1932, supervised by the
International  Federation  of  Eugenics Societies.s9 This meeting
took up the stubborn persistence of African-Americans  and  other
allegedly  ``inferior''  and  ``socially  inadequate''groups in
reproducing, expanding their numbers, and  ``amalgamating''  with
others. It  was  recommendedthat  these  ``dangers''  to  the
``better'' ethnic groups and to the ``well-born,'' could be dealt
with by sterilization or ``cutting off the  bad  stock''  of  the
``unfit.''
 Italy's  fascist  government  sent an official representative.
<ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman's sister <ent type='person'>Mary</ent>, director of ``entertainment'' for
the Congress, lived down in  Virginia  fox-hunting  country;  her
state  supplied  the  speaker on ``racial purity,'' W.A. Plecker,
Virginia commissioner of vital statistics.  Plecker  reportedly
held the delegates spellbound with his account of the struggle to
stop race-mixing and interracial sex in Virginia.
 TheCongress proceedings were dedicated to <ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman's
mother; she  had  paidfor  the  founding  ofthe  race-science
movement  in  America  back in 1910, building the Eugenics Record
Office as a branch of the Galton National Laboratory  in  London.
She  and other Harrimans were usually escorted to the horse races
by old <ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Herbert</ent> <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>--they shared with the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>es and the
<ent type='person'>Farish</ent>es a  fascination  with  ``breeding  thoroughbreds''  among
horses and humans.s1s0
 <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>  Harriman  personally  arranged  with  the <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>/<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
Hamburg-Amerika Line to transport Nazi ideologues from Germany to
New York for  this  meeting.s1s1  The  most  famous  among  those
transported  was  Dr.  Ernst  <ent type='person'>Rudin</ent>,  psychiatrist  at the Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute for Genealogy and Demography in  Berlin,  where
the Rockefeller  family  paid  for Dr.<ent type='person'>Rudin</ent> to occupy an entire
floor with his eugenics ``research.'' Dr. <ent type='person'>Rudin</ent> had addressed the
International  Federation's  1928  Munich  meeting,  speaking  on
``Mental Aberration and Race Hygiene,'' while others (Germans and
Americans)  spoke  on race-mixing and sterilization of the unfit.
<ent type='person'>Rudin</ent> had led the German delegation to the  1930  Mental  Hygiene
Congress in Washington, D.C.
 At the Harrimans' 1932 New York Eugenics Congress, <ent type='person'>Ernst Rudin</ent>
was unanimously elected President of the International Federation
of  Eugenics  Societies. This was recognition of <ent type='person'>Rudin</ent> as founder
of the German Society for  Race  Hygiene,  with  his  co-founder,
Eugenics Federation vice president <ent type='person'>Alfred Ploetz</ent>.
 As  depression-maddened  financiersschemed in Berlin and New
York, <ent type='person'>Rudin</ent>  was  now  official  leader  of  the  world  eugenics
movement. <ent type='person'>Componentsof</ent>  his  movement  included  groups  with
overlapping leadership, dedicated to:
 sb|sterilization  of mental patients (``mental hygiene
societies'');
 sb|execution  of  the insane, criminals and the terminally ill
(``euthanasia societies''); and
 sb|eugenical race-purification  by  prevention  of  births  to
parents  from  inferior blood stocks (``birth control
societies'').</p>

<p> Before the Auschwitz death camp became a household word, these
British-American-European groups called openly for  the
elimination  of  the  ``unfit''  by  means  including  force  and
violence.s1s2
 Ten months later, in June  1933,  <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s  interior  minister
<ent type='person'>Wilhelm Frick</ent> spoke to a eugenics meeting in the new Third Reich.
<ent type='person'>Frick</ent>  called  the  Germans  a``degenerate''race,  denouncing
one-fifth of Germany's parentsfor  producing``feeble-minded''
and ``defective'' children.  The following month, on a commission
by  <ent type='person'>Frick</ent>,  Dr. <ent type='person'>Ernst Rudin</ent> wrote the ``Law for the Prevention of
Hereditary Diseases in Posterity,'' the sterilization law modeled
on previous U.S. statutes in Virginia and other states.
 Special courts were soon established for the sterilization  of
German mental  patients,  the blind, the deaf, and alcoholics.A
quarter million  people  in  these  categorieswere  sterilized.
<ent type='person'>Rudin</ent>, Ploetz, and their colleagues trained a whole generation of
physicians and psychiatrists--as sterilizers and as killers.
 When thewar started, the  eugenicists,  doctors,  and
psychiatrists staffed the new ``T4'' agency,  which  planned  and
supervised  the  mass  killings: first at ``euthanasia centers,''
where the  same  categories  which  had  firstbeen  subject  to
sterilization  were now to be murdered, their brains sent in lots
of 200 to experimental psychiatrists; then at slave camps such as
Auschwitz; and finally, for  Jews  andother  race  victims,  at
straight  extermination  campsin  Poland, such as <ent type='person'>Treblinka</ent> and
<ent type='person'>Belsen</ent>.s1s3
 In 1933, as what <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> called  his``New  Order''appeared,
<ent type='person'>John</ent> D. Rockefeller,Jr.  appointed<ent type='person'>William</ent>  S.  <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> the
chairman of Standard Oil Co.  of New Jersey (in 1937 he was  made
president and  chief  executive).  <ent type='person'>Farish</ent>  moved his offices to
Rockefeller Center, New York, where he spent a good deal of  time
with <ent type='person'>Hermann Schmitz</ent>, chairman of I.G. Farben; his company paid a
publicity man,Ivy  <ent type='person'>Lee</ent>,  to write pro-I.G.  Farben and pro-Nazi
propaganda and get it into the U.S. press.
 Now that he was outside of Texas, <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> found himself in  the
shipping business--like  the  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  family.  He hired Nazi German
crews for Standard Oil tankers.  And he hired {Emil  <ent type='person'>Helfferich</ent>,}
chairman  of  the  <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>/<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>/Harriman  Hamburg-Amerika Line, as
chairman also of the Standard Oil Company subsidiary in  Germany.
Karl  <ent type='person'>Lindemann</ent>,  board  member of Hamburg-Amerika, also became a
top <ent type='person'>Farish</ent>-Standard executive in Germany.s1s4
 This interlock between their Nazi German operations put <ent type='person'>Farish</ent>
together with <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> ina  small,  select  group  of  men
operating from  abroad  through  <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s  ``revolution,''  and
calculating that they would never be punished.
 In 1939, <ent type='person'>Farish</ent>'s daughter <ent type='person'>Martha</ent> married  <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>  Harriman's
nephew, <ent type='person'>Edward Harriman</ent> <ent type='person'>Gerry</ent>, and <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> in-laws became <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s partners at 59 Broadway.s1s5
 Both  Emil  <ent type='person'>Helfferich</ent>  and<ent type='person'>Karl Lindemann</ent> were authorized to
write checks to Heinrich <ent type='person'>Himmler</ent>, chief of  the  Nazi  SS,  ona
special Standard  Oil  account. This account was managed by the
German-British-American banker, <ent type='person'>Kurt von Schroeder</ent>. According  to
U.S. intelligence  documents reviewed by author <ent type='person'>Anthony Sutton</ent>,
<ent type='person'>Helfferich</ent> continued his payments to the SS into 1944,when  the
SS  was  supervising  the mass murder at the Standard-I.G. Farben
Auschwitz and  other  death  camps.  <ent type='person'>Helfferich</ent> told Allied
interrogators  after  the  warthat  these were not his personal
contributions--they were corporate Standard Oil funds.s1s6
 After  pleading  ``no  contest''  to charges of criminal
conspiracy  with  the  Nazis,  <ent type='person'>William</ent>Stamps<ent type='person'>Farish</ent>was fined
$5000. (Similar fines were levied against  Standard  Oil--$5000
each  for  the parent company and for several subsidiaries.) This
of course did not interfere with the  millionsof  dollars  that
<ent type='person'>Farish</ent>had acquired in conjunction with <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s New Order, as a
large stockholder, chairman, and president of StandardOil.  All
the  government  sought  was the use of patents which his company
had given to the Nazis--the Auschwitz patents--but  had  withheld
from the U.S. military and industry.
 <ent type='person'>Buta</ent>  warwas  on, and if young men were to be asked to die
fighting <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> something more was needed.  <ent type='person'>Farish</ent>  was  hauled
beforethe  Senate  committee investigating the national defense
program.  The committee  chairman,  Senator  Harry  <ent type='person'>Truman</ent>,  told
newsmen  before  <ent type='person'>Farish</ent>  testified:  ``I  think  this  approaches
treason.''s1s7
 <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> began breaking apart at these hearings.  He shouted his
``indignation''  at  the  senators,  and  claimed  <ent type='person'>hewas</ent> not
``disloyal.''
 After  the  March-April hearings ended, more dirt came gushing
out of the Justice Department and  theCongress  on  <ent type='person'>Farish</ent>  and
Standard  Oil.<ent type='person'>Farish</ent>had deceived the U.S. Navy to prevent the
Navy from acquiring certain patents, while supplying them to  the
Nazi  war  machine;  meanwhile,  he  was  supplying  gasoline and
tetraethyl  lead  to  Germany's submarines and air force.
Communications between Standard and I.G. Farben from the outbreak
of  World  WarII  were  released  tothe  Senate, showing that
<ent type='person'>Farish</ent>'s organization had arranged to deceive the U.S. government
into passing over Nazi-owned assets:  They  would  nominally  buy
I.G.'sshare  in  certain  patents because ``in the event of war
between ourselves and Germany ...  it  would  certainly  be  very
undesireable  to  havethis  20 percent Standard-I.G. pass to an
alien property custodian of the U.S. who  might  sell  it  to  an
unfriendly interest.''s1s8
 <ent type='person'>John</ent>  D.  Rockefeller,  Jr. (father of <ent type='person'>David</ent>, Nelson, and <ent type='person'>John</ent>
D.  Rockefeller III), the controlling owner of Standard Oil, told
the  <ent type='person'>Rooseveltadministrationthat</ent>  he  knewnothing  of the
day-to-day  affairs  of  his company, that all these matters were
handled by <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> and other executives.s1s9
 In August, <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> was brought back for more testimony.  He was
now frequently accused of lying.  <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> was  crushed  under  the
intense, public grilling;  he  became  morose,  ashen.  While
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> escaped publicity when the  government  seized  his
Nazi banking organization in October, <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> had been nailed.  He
collapsed and died of a heart attack on November 29, 1942.
 The <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> family was devastated by the exposure.  <ent type='person'>Son William</ent>
Stamps<ent type='person'>Farish</ent>,  Jr.,  a  lieutenant  in  the Army Air Force, was
humiliated by the public knowledge that his  father  was  fueling
the enemy's aircraft; he died in a training accident in Texas six
months later.s2s0
 With  this  double  death,  the  fortune  comprising  much  of
Standard Oil's profits from Texas and Nazi Germany was now to  be
settled upon the littlefour-year-old  grandson,  <ent type='person'>William</ent>
(``Will'') Stamps <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> III. <ent type='person'>Will Farish</ent> grew up a recluse,  the
most  secretive  multimillionaire  in  Texas, with investments of
``that money'' in a multitude of foreign countries, and a host of
exoticcontacts  overlapping  the  intelligence  andfinancial
worlds--particularly in Britain.
 The <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>-<ent type='person'>Farish</ent>  axis started <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>'s career.After his
1948 graduation  from  Yale  (and  theSkull  and  Bones  secret
society),  <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> flew down to Texas on a corporate jet and
was employed by his father's <ent type='person'>Dresser</ent> Industries. In a  couple  of
years  he  <ent type='person'>gothelp</ent>  from  his  uncle,  <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>, Jr., and
<ent type='person'>Farish</ent>'s British banker  friends,  to  set  him  up  in  the  oil
property speculation  business.  Soon  thereafter,  <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>
founded the <ent type='person'>Zapata</ent> Oil Company, which put oil drilling rigs  into
certain locations of great strategic interest to  the
Anglo-American intelligence community.
 Twenty-five-year-old <ent type='person'>Will Farish</ent> was personal aide  to  <ent type='person'>Zapata</ent>
chairman  <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>in  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s unsuccessful 1964 campaign for
Senate. <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> used ``that Auschwitz money'' to back <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
financially,  investing  in  <ent type='person'>Zapata</ent>.  When  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  was  elected to
Congress in 1966, <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> joined the <ent type='person'>Zapata</ent> board.s2s1
 When <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> became  U.S.  vicepresident  in  1980,  the
<ent type='person'>Farish</ent>and  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> family fortunes were again completely, secretly
commingled.  As we shall see, the old  projects  were  now  being
revived on a breathtaking scale.</p>

<p><ent type='person'>Bush</ent> and Draper</p>

<p> Twenty years  before  he  was  U.S.  President,  <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>
brought  two  ``race-science''professors  in front of the
Republican  Task  Force  on  Earth  Resources  and Population. As
chairman  of  the  Task  Force,  then-Congressman  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> invited
Professors  <ent type='person'>William</ent>  Shockley and <ent type='person'>Arthur Jensen</ent> to explain to the
committee how allegedly runaway birth-rates for African-Americans
were ``down-breeding'' the American population.
 Afterwards, <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> personally summed up  for  the  Congress  the
testimony  hisblack-inferiority advocates had given to the Task
Force.s2s2 <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> held his hearings on the threatposed  by
black  babies on August 5, 1969, while much of the world was in a
better frame of mind--celebrating  mankind's  progressfrom  the
first moon landing 16 days earlier.  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s obsessive thinking on
this  subject  was guided by his family's friend, Gen. <ent type='person'>William</ent> H.
Draper, Jr., the founder and chairman of  the  Population  Crisis
Committee, and vice chairman of  the  Planned  Parenthood
Federation. Draper had long been steering U.S. public  discussion
about the so-called ``population bomb'' in the non-white areas of
the world.
 If  Congressman  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> had explained to his colleagues {how his
family had come to know General Draper,} they would perhaps  have
felt  some  alarm, or even panic, and paid more healthy attention
to <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s presentation.  Unfortunately,the Draper-<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
population doctrine is now official U.S. foreign policy.
 <ent type='person'>William</ent>  H. Draper, Jr. had joined the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> team in 1927, when
he was hired by <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent> Read &amp; Co., New York  investment  bankers.
Draperwas  put  intoa  new job slot at the firm: handling the
Thyssen account.
 We recall that in 1924, <ent type='person'>Fritz Thyssen</ent> set up his Union Banking
Corporation in <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Herbert</ent><ent type='person'>Walker</ent>'s  bankat  39Broadway,
Manhattan.  <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent>  Read &amp; Co.'s boss, <ent type='person'>Clarence Dillon</ent>, had begun
working with <ent type='person'>Fritz Thyssen</ent> some time after <ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman first
met with Thyssen--at about the time Thyssen began financing Adolf
<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s political career.
 In January 1926, <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent> Read created the  {German  Credit  and
Investment Corporation}  in  Newark,New  Jersey  and  Berlin,
Germany, as Thyssen's short-term banker.  That same year,  <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent>
Read  created  the  {<ent type='person'>Vereinigte Stahlwerke</ent>} (German Steel Trust),
incorporating the Thyssen family interests under the direction of
New York and London finance.s2s3
 <ent type='person'>William</ent> H. Draper, Jr. was made director, vice president,  and
assistant treasurer of the German Credit and Investment Corp. His
business was short-term loans and financial management tricks for
Thyssen  and  the  German Steel Trust. Draper's clients sponsored
<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s terroristic takeover; his clients led the buildup of the
Nazi war industry;  his  clients  madewar  against  the  United
States. The Nazis were Draper's direct partners in Berlin and New
Jersey:  Alexander  Kreuter,  residingin Berlin, was president;
<ent type='person'>Frederic Brandi</ent>, whose father was a top  coal  executive  in  the
German Steel Trust, moved to the United States in 1926 and served
as Draper's co-director in Newark.
 Draper's  role  wascrucial  for  <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent> Read &amp; Co., for whom
Draper was a partner and eventually vice president. The  German
Creditand  Investment  Corp.(GCI)  was a ``front'' for <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent>
Read: It had the same New Jersey address as U.S. &amp;  International
Securities  Corp. (USIS), and the same man served as treasurer of
both firms.s2s4
 <ent type='person'>Clarence Dillon</ent> and his son C.  Douglas <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent> weredirectors
of  USIS,  which  was spotlighted when <ent type='person'>Clarence Dillon</ent> was hauled
before the Senate Banking Committee's famous ``Pecora''  hearings
in  1933.  USIS  was  shown  to  be  one of the great speculative
pyramid schemes which had swindled stockholders  of  hundreds  of
millions of  dollars. These investment policies had rotted the
U.S. economy to the core, and led to the Great Depression of  the
1930s.
 But <ent type='person'>William</ent> H.Draper, Jr.'s  GCI  ``front''  was  not
{apparently} affiliated with the USIS ``front'' or  with  <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent>,
and the  GCI  escaped  the  congressmen's limited scrutiny.  This
oversight was to prove most unfortunate, particularly to  the  50
million people who subsequently died in World War II.
 <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent>  Read  hiredpublicrelations  man Ivy <ent type='person'>Lee</ent> to prepare
their executives for their testimony and to confuse  and  further
bafflethe  congressmen.s2s5 <ent type='person'>Lee</ent> apparently took enough time out
from his duties as image-maker for <ent type='person'>William</ent> S. <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> and the Nazi
I.G.  Farben Co.; he managed the congressional thinking  so  that
the congressmen did  not  disturb  the  Draper  operation  in
Germany--and did not  meddle  with  Thyssen,  or  interfere  with
<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s U.S. moneymen.
 Thus,  in  1932, Willam H. Draper, Jr. was free to finance the
International Eugenics Congress as a  ``Supporting  Member.''s2s6
Was heusing  his  own income as a Thyssen trust banker?  Or did
the funds come from <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent> Read corporate accounts, perhaps to be
written off income tax as ``expenses  for  German  project:  race
purification''?  Draper helped select <ent type='person'>Ernst Rudin</ent> as chief of the
world  eugenics  movement, who used his office to promote what he
called <ent type='person'>Adolf Hitler</ent>'s ``holy, national and  international  racial
hygienic mission.''s2s7
 W.S.  <ent type='person'>Farish</ent>  was  publiclyexposed  in  1942, humiliated and
destroyed.  Just before <ent type='person'>Farish</ent> died, <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s Nazi banking
office was quietly seized and shut down. But<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>'s  close
friendand  partner  in  the Thyssen-<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent> business, <ent type='person'>William</ent> H.
Draper, Jr., {neither died normoved  out  ofGermanaffairs.}
Draperlistedhimself  as  adirector of the German Credit and
Investment Corp. through 1942, and the firm  was  not  liquidated
until November1943.s2s8  <ent type='person'>Buta</ent>  war was on.Draper, a colonel
from previous military service, went off to the  Pacific  theater
and became a general.
 General  Draper  apparentlyhad  ahobby:magic--illusions,
sleight of hand, etc.--and he was a  member  of  the  Society  of
American  Magicians.  This  isnot  irrelevant to his subsequent
career.
 The Nazi regime surrendered in May 1945. In July 1945, General
Draper was called to Europe by the American  military  government
authorities in  Germany.  Draper  was  appointed  head  of  the
Economics Division of  the  U.S.  Control  Commission.  He  was
assigned to  take  apart the Nazi corporate cartels.  There is an
astonishing but perfectly logical rationale to this--Draper  knew
a lot  about the subject!  General Draper, who had spent about 15
years  financing  and  managing  the dirtiest of the Nazi
enterprises,  was  now authorized to decide {who was exposed, who
lost and who kept his business, and in practical effect, who  was
prosecuted for war crimes.}s2s9
 (Draper was not unique  within  the  postwar  occ<ent type='person'>upa</ent>tion
government.  Consider the case of <ent type='person'>John</ent> J. McCloy, U.S. Military
Governor  and  High  Commissioner  of  Germany,  1949-1952. Under
instructions from his Wall Street law firm, McCloy had lived  for
a  year in Italy, serving as an adviser to the fascist government
of Benito  <ent type='person'>Mussolini</ent>.  An intimate collaborator of the
Harriman/<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  bank,  McCloy had sat in <ent type='person'>Adolf Hitler</ent>'s box at the
1936  Olympic  games  in  Berlin,  at  the  invitationof Nazi
chieftains <ent type='person'>Rudolf Hess</ent> and <ent type='person'>Hermann Goering</ent>.)s3s0</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>William</ent> H. Draper, Jr., as a ``conservative,'' was paired with
the  ``liberal''  U.S.Treasury  Secretary <ent type='person'>Henry Morgenthau</ent> in a
vicious game. <ent type='person'>Morgenthau</ent>  demanded  that  Germany  be  utterly
destroyed  as a nation, that its industry be dismantled and it be
reduced to a purely rural country.  As the economic boss in  1945
and  1946,  Draper ``protected'' Germany from the <ent type='person'>Morgenthau</ent> Plan
... but at a price.
 Draper and his colleagues demanded that Germany and the  world
acceptthe  {collective  guilt  of  the  German  people} as {the
}explanation for the rise of <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>'s New Order, and the Nazi war
crimes.  This, of  course,  was  rather  convenient  for  General
Draper himself,  as  it  was  for  the<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> family.  It is still
convenient decades  later,  allowing  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>'s  son,President
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>,  to lecture Germany on the danger of <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>ism. Germans are
too slow, it seems, to accept his New World Order.
 After several  years  of  government  service  (often  working
directly  for  <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>Harriman in the North Atlantic Alliance),
Draper was appointed in 1958 chairman of a committee which was to
advise President <ent type='person'>Dwight Eisenhower</ent> on the proper course for  U.S.
military aid to other countries.  At that time, <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> was
a  U.S.  senator from Connecticut, a confidential friend and golf
partner with National  Security  Director  <ent type='person'>Gordon</ent>  Gray,  and  an
important golf partner with Dwight  <ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent>as  well.
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>'s old lawyer from the Nazi days, <ent type='person'>John Foster</ent> Dulles, was
Secretary of State, and his brother <ent type='person'>Allen</ent> Dulles, formerly of the
Schroder bank, was head of the CIA.
 This friendly environment emboldened  our  General  Draper  to
pull off  a  stunt  with his military aid advisery committee.  He
changed the subject under study.  The following year, the  Draper
committee recommended  that  the  U.S.  government react to the
supposed threat of the ``population  explosion''  by  formulating
plans to  depopulate  the  poorer  countries.The growth of the
world's non-white population, he proposed, should be regarded  as
dangerous to the national security of the United States!s3s1
 President <ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent>  rejected the recommendation.  But in the
next decade,  General  Draper  foundedthe  ``Population  Crisis
Committee'' and the ``Draper Fund,'' joining with the Rockefeller
and DuPont families to  promote  eugenics  as  ``population
control.''  The  administration  of  PresidentLyndon <ent type='person'>John</ent>son,
advised  by  Draper on the subject, began financing birth control
in the tropical countries through the  Agency  for  International
Development.
 General <ent type='person'>William</ent> Draper  was  <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  guru  on  the
population question.s3s2 But there was also Draper's  money--from
that  uniquelyhorrible source--and Draper's connections on Wall
Street and abroad.  Draper's son and heir, <ent type='person'>William</ent> H. Draper III,
was  co-chairman  for  finance(chiefof  fundraising)  of  the
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>-for-President  national  campaign organization in 1980. With
<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> in the White House, the younger Draper heads  up  the
depopulation  activities  of  the  United  Nations throughout the
world.
 Draper was vice president of <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent> Read  until  1953.  During
the  1950s  and  1960s,  the  chief  executive there was Frederic
Brandi, the German who was  Draper's  co-director  forthe  Nazi
investments  and  his  personal  contact  man with the Nazi Steel
Trust.Nicholas  Brady  was  Brandi'spartner  from  1954,  and
replaced him  as  the  firm's  chief executive in 1971.  Nicholas
Brady, who knows where all the bodies are buried, was chairman of
his friend <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>'s 1980 election campaign  in  New  Jersey,
and  has  been United States Treasury Secretary throughout <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s
presidency.s3s3</p>

<p><ent type='person'>Bush</ent> and Grey</p>

<p> The U.S. Agency forInternational  Development  (USAID)  says
that  surgical sterilization is the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> administration's ``first
choice'' method of population reduction in the Third World.s3s4
 The United Nations Population Fund claims that 37  percent  of
contraception  users  in  Ibero-America  and  the  Caribbean have
already been surgically sterilized.  In a 1991 report, <ent type='person'>William</ent> H.
Draper III's U.N. agency asserts that 254 million couples will be
surgically sterilized over the course of the 1990s; and  that  if
present  trends  continue, 80 percent of the women in Puerto Rico
and Panama will be surgically sterilized.s3s5
 The U.S. government pays directly for these sterilizations.
 Mexico is first among targeted nations, on a  list  which  was
drawn up  in  July  1991, at a USAID strategy session.India and
Brazil are second and third priorities, respectively.
 On contract with the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> administration, U.S.  personnel  are
working  from  bases  in Mexico to perform surgery on millions of
Mexican men and women.The acknowledged strategy in this program
is to sterilize those young adults who have not already completed
their families.
 <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> has a rather deep-seated  personal  feeling  about
this project, in particular as it pits him against Pope <ent type='person'>John</ent> <ent type='person'>Paul</ent>
II in Catholic countries such as Mexico. (See Chapter 4 below, on
the origin of a <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>-family grudge in this regard.)
 <ent type='person'>Thespending</ent>  for birth control in the non-white countries is
one ofthe  few  items  that  is  headed  upwards  inthe  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
administration budget.  As its 1992 budget was being set, USAID
said its Population Account would  receive  $300  million,  a  20
percent increase  over the previous year.  Within this project, a
significant  sum  is  spent  on political and psychological
manipulations of target nations, and rather blatant subversion of
their religions and governments.s3s6
 These activities might be expected to cause serious objections
from the  victimized  nationalities,  or  fromU.S. taxpayers,
especially if the program is somehow given widespread publicity.
 Quite aside from moral considerations, {legal} questions would
naturally arise, which could be summed up: {How does <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
think he can get away with this?}
 In this matter the  President  has  expert  advice.  Mr.
(Clayland) Boyden Gray has been counsel to <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> since  the
1980 election.As chief legal officer in the White House, Boyden
Gray  can walk the President through the dangers and complexities
of waging such unusual warfare against Third  World  populations.
Gray knows how these things are done.
 When  Boyden  Gray  was  four  and  five years old, his father
organized  thepilotproject forthe presentworldwide
sterilization  program,  from  the Gray family household in North
Carolina.
 It started in 1946. The eugenics movement was  looking  fora
way to begin again in America.
 Nazi  deathcamps  such as Auschwitz had just then seared the
conscience of the world.  The Sterilization  League  of  America,
which  had  changed  its  nameduringthe  war to ``Birthright,
Inc.,'' wanted to start up again.  First  theyhad  to  overcome
public nervousness about  crackpots  proposing  toeliminate
``inferior'' and ``defective''people.  TheLeaguetried  to
surface  in  Iowa,  but  had  to  backoff  because  of negative
publicity: a little boy had recently been  sterilized  there  and
had died from the operation.
 They  decided  on  North Carolina, where the Gray family could
play the perfect host.s3s7  Through  British  imperialcontacts,
BoydenGray's grandfather <ent type='person'>Bowman Gray</ent> had become principal owner
of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Boyden's  father,  <ent type='person'>Gordon</ent>  Gray,
had recently founded the <ent type='person'>Bowman Gray</ent> (memorial) Medical School in
Winston-Salem, using  his  inherited cigarette stock shares.  The
medical school was already a eugenics center.
 As the experiment  began,  <ent type='person'>Gordon</ent>  Gray's  great  aunt,  Alice
Shelton  Gray,who  had raised him from childhood, was living in
his household.Aunt Alice hadfounded  the  ``Human  Betterment
League,''  theNorth  Carolina  branch of the national eugenical
sterilization movement.
 Aunt  Alicewas  the  official  supervisorof  the 1946-47
experiment.  Working under Miss Gray was Dr. <ent type='person'>Claude Nash Herndon</ent>,
whom  <ent type='person'>Gordon</ent>  Gray  had  made  assistant  professor  of ``medical
genetics'' at <ent type='person'>Bowman Gray</ent> medical school.
 Dr. <ent type='person'>Clarence Gamble</ent>, heir  to  the  Proctorand  Gamble  soap
fortune, was the sterilizers' national field operations chief.
 The experiment  worked  as follows.{All children enrolled in
the school district of Winston-Salem, N.C., were given a  special
``intelligencetest.'' Those children who scored below a certain
arbitrary low mark were then cut open and surgically sterilized.}
 We quote now from the official  story  of  the  project:  ``In
Winston-Salem  and in [nearby] Orange County, North Carolina, the
[Sterilization League's]  field  committee  had  participated  in
testing  projects  to  identify school age children who should be
considered for sterilization.  The project in Orange  County  was
conducted by the University of North Carolina and was financed by
a  `Mr.  <ent type='person'>Hanes</ent>,' a friend of <ent type='person'>Clarence Gamble</ent> and supporter of the
field work project in North Carolina. The  Winston-Salem  project
was  also financed by <ent type='person'>Hanes</ent>. [``<ent type='person'>Hanes</ent>'' was underwear mogul James
<ent type='person'>Gordon</ent> <ent type='person'>Hanes</ent>,  a  trustee  of  Bowman  Gray  Medical  School  and
treasurer of <ent type='person'>Alice Gray</ent>'s group]....
 ``The  medical  school  hada  long  history  of  interest in
eugenics  and  had  compiled  extensive  histories  of families
carrying inheritable  disease. In 1946, Dr. C. Nash <ent type='person'>Herndon</ent> ...
made a statement to the press on  the  use  ofsterilization  to
prevent the spread of inheritable diseases....
 ``The first step after giving the mental tests to grade school
children was to interpret and make public the results.In Orange
County the results indicated that three percent of the school age
children were either insane or feebleminded....  [Then] the field
committee  hired  a  social worker to review each case ... and to
present any cases in which sterilization  was  indicated  to  the
State  Eugenics  Board,  whichunder  North Carolina law had the
authority to order sterilization....''
 Race science experimenter Dr.  Claude  Nash<ent type='person'>Herndon</ent>  provided
more details in an interview in 1990:s3s8
 ``<ent type='person'>Alice Gray</ent>  was  the general supervisor of the project.  She
and  <ent type='person'>Hanes</ent>  sent  out  letterspromoting  theprogram  to the
commissioners  of all 100 counties in North Carolina.... What did
I do?  Nothing besides riding herd  onthe  whole  thing!  The
social workers operated out of my office.  I was at the time also
director of  outpatient  services  at  NorthCarolina  Baptist
Hospital. We  would  see  the  [targeted]  parents  and  children
there....  I.Q.  tests  wererun  on  all  the children in the
Winston-Salem public school system.  Only  theones  who  scored
reallylow [were targeted for sterilization], the real bottom of
the barrel, like below 70.
 ``Did we do sterilizations on young children?  Yes. This was a
relatively minor operation....It  was  usually  not  until  the
child was eight or ten years old.  For the boys, you just make an
incision and  tie  thetube....  <ent type='person'>Wemore</ent>  often performed the
operation on girls than with boys.  Of course, you  have  to  cut
open the abdomen, but again, it is relatively minor.''
 Dr.<ent type='person'>Herndon</ent>  remarked  coolly  that  ``we  had  a  very  good
relationship with the press'' for  <ent type='person'>theproject</ent>.  This  is  not
surprising,  since <ent type='person'>Gordon Gray</ent> owned the {Winston-Salem Journal,}
the {Twin City Sentinel,} and radio station WSJS.
 In 1950 and 1951, <ent type='person'>John Foster</ent> Dulles,  <ent type='person'>thenchairman</ent>  of  the
Rockefeller Foundation,  led <ent type='person'>John</ent> D.  Rockefeller III on a series
of world tours, focusing on the need to stop the expansion of the
non-white populations.In November 1952, Dulles and  Rockefeller
set  up  the Population Council, with tens of millions of dollars
from the Rockefeller family.
 At that point, the American Eugenics Society,  still  cautious
from  the  recent  badpublicity  vis-a-vis <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>, left its old
headquarters  at  YaleUniversity. The Society moved its
headquarters  into  the office of the Population Council, and the
two groups melded together.  The  long-time  secretary  of  the
Eugenics  Society,  <ent type='person'>Frederick Osborne</ent>, became the first president
of the Population Council.  The Gray  family'schild-sterilizer,
Dr. C.  Nash <ent type='person'>Herndon</ent>, became president of the American Eugenics
Society  in  1953,  asits  work  expanded under Rockefeller
patronage.
 Meanwhile, the International Planned Parenthood Federation was
founded  in  London,  in  the  officesof  the  British Eugenics
Society.
 The undead enemy  from  World  War  II,  renamed  ``Population
Control,'' had now been revived.
 <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 1972,
when  with  prodding from <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> and his friends, the United States
Agency for  International  Developmentfirst  made  an  official
contract with the old Sterilization League of America. The league
had  changed  its  name  twiceagain,and  was  now  called the
``Association for Voluntary Surgical  Contraception.''The  U.S.
government  began  paying  theold  fascist  group  to sterilize
non-whites in foreign countries.
 The Gray family experiment had succeeded.
 In 1988, the U.S. Agency for International Development  signed
its  latest  contract  with  the old Sterilization League (a.k.a.
``Association  for  Voluntary  Sterilization''),  committing  the
U.S.  government to spend $80 million over five years.
 Having  gotten  away  with  sterilizing  several hundred North
Carolina school children, ``not usually less than  eight  to  ten
years  old,''  the identical group is now authorized by President
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> to do it to 58 countries in Asia, Africa, and Ibero-America.
The group modestly claims  it  has  directly  sterilized  only2
million  people,  with87  percent  of  the  bill  paid  by U.S.
taxpayers.
 Meanwhile, Dr. <ent type='person'>Clarence Gamble</ent>, Boyden  Gray's  favorite  soap
manufacturer,  formed  his own ``Pathfinder Fund'' as a split-off
from the Sterlization  League.Gamble's  Pathfinder  Fund,  with
additional  millions  from  USAID, concentrates on penetration of
local social groups in the non-white  countries,  to  break  down
psychological resistance to the surgical sterilization teams.</p>

<p> January 21, 1932
 Dear Dr. <ent type='person'>Davenport</ent>:
 I will be  only  too  glad  to  putyou  in  touchwith  the
Hamburg-American  Linethey  may be able to co-operate in making
suggestions which will keep the expenses to a minimum.  I  have
referred  your letter to Mr. <ent type='person'>Emil Lederer</ent> [of the Hamburg-Amerika
executive board in New York] with the request that he communicate
with you.</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Davenport</ent> to Mr. W.A.  Harriman, 59Wall  Street,  New  York,
N.Y.</p>

<p> January 23, 1932
 Dear Mr. Harriman:
 Thank  you  very much for your kind letter of January 21st and
the action you took which has resulted at once in a  letter  from
Mr.  <ent type='person'>Emil Lederer</ent>. This letter will serve as a starting point for
correspondence, which I hope  will  enable  more  of  our  German
colleagues  tocome to America on the occasion of the congresses
of eugenics and genetics, than otherwise.</p>

<p> Congressional  hearingsin  1934  established  that
Hamburg-Amerika routinely provided free transatlantic passage for
those carrying out Nazi propaganda chores.  See {Investigation of
Nazi  Propaganda  Activities  and  Investigation of Certain Other
Propaganda Activities,} {op. cit.,} chapter 2.</p>

 The battle cry of the New Order was sounded in 1935with  the
publication  of  {Man  the  Unknown,} by Dr. <ent type='person'>Alexis Carrel</ent> of the
Rockefeller Institute in New York. This Nobel  Prize-winner  said
``enormous  sums  are now required to maintain prisons and insane
asylums.... Why  do  we  preserve  these  useless  and  harmful
beings?  This  fact  must  be squarely faced.  Why should society
not dispose of the criminals and the insane in a more  economical
manner? ... The community must be protected against troublesome
and dangerouselements....  Perhaps prisons should be
abolished....The  conditioning  of the petty criminal with the
whip, or some more scientific procedure, followed by a short stay
in hospital, would probably suffice to insure order.  [Criminals,
including those] who have ...  misled  the  public  onimportant
matters, should be humanely and economically disposed of in small
euthanasic institutions  supplied  with  proper gases.A similar
treatment could be advantageously applied to the  insane,  guilty
of criminal acts.''
 Carrel  claimed  tohave  transplanted  the  head of a dog to
another dog and kept it alive for quite some time.</p>

Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. 59 Wall Street, New  York  Cable  Address
``Shipley-New York'' Business Established 1818
 Private Bankers</p>

<p>September 5, 1944</p>

<p>The  Honorable W. A. Harriman American Ambassador to the U.S.S.R.
American Embassy, Moscow, Russia</p>

<p>Dear <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>:</p>

<p> Thinking that possibly Bullitt's article in the  recent  issue
of  ``LIFE''  may not have come to your attention, I have clipped
it and am sending it to you, feeling that it will interest you.
At present writing all is well here.</p>

<p>With warm regards, I am, Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>  Pres</p>

<p> `At present writing all is well here.'' Thus the ambassador to
Russia was  reassured  by  themanaging  partner  of  his  firm,
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>.  Only  22  anda  half  months  before, the U.S.
government  had  seized  and  shut down the Union Banking
Corporation, which had been operated on behalf of Nazi Germany by
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  and  theHarrimans. But that was behind them now, and they
were safe.  There would be  nopublicity  on  the  Harriman-<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
sponsorship of <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>ism.
 <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>'s  son  <ent type='person'>George</ent>,  the  future U.S. President, was also
safe.  Three days before this note to Moscow was written,  <ent type='person'>George</ent>
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  had parachuted from a Navy bomber airplane over the Pacific
Ocean, killing his two crew  members  when  the  unpiloted  plane
crashed.
 Five  months  later, in February 1945, <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>'s boss <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>
Harriman escorted President Franklin  <ent type='person'>Roosevelt</ent>  to  the  fateful
summit meetingwith  Soviet  leader  <ent type='person'>Joseph</ent> <ent type='person'>Stalin</ent> at Yalta.  In
April <ent type='person'>Roosevelt</ent> died.  The agreement reached  at  Yalta,  calling
for  free  elections  in  Poland  oncethe  war ended, was never
enforced.
 Over the next eight years (1945 through 1952),  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
was Harriman'sanchorin  the  New  York  financial world.  The
increasingly powerful Mr. Harriman and his  allies  gave  Eastern
Europe over  to  Soviet  dictatorship.  A  Cold  Warwas  then
undertaken, to ``counterbalance'' the Soviets.
 This  British-inspired  strategy  paid several nightmarish
dividends.  Eastern  Europe  was to remain enslaved.  Germany was
``permanently'' divided.  Anglo-American  power was jointly
exercised  over  the  non-Soviet ``Free World.'' The confidential
functions of the British and American  governments  were  merged.
The Harriman clique took possession of the U.S. national security
apparatus, and in doing so, they opened the gate and let the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
family in.

<p> Following  his  services  to  Germany's  Nazi  Party,  <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>
Harriman spentseveral  yearsmediating  between  the  British,
American, and Soviet governments in the war to stop the Nazis. He
was ambassador to Moscow from 1943 to 1946.</p>

<p> President  <ent type='person'>Harry Truman</ent>, whom Harriman and his friends held in
amused contempt, appointed Harriman U.S.  ambassador  to  Britain
in 1946.
 Harriman  was  at  lunch  with  former  British Prime Minister
<ent type='person'>Winston Churchill</ent>  oneday  in  1946,when  <ent type='person'>Truman</ent>  telephoned.
Harriman  asked  Churchill  if he should accept <ent type='person'>Truman</ent>'s offer to
come back to the U.S. as  Secretary  of  Commerce.  According  to
Harriman's  account, Churchill told him: ``Absolutely. The center
of power is in Washington.''s1</p>

<p> Jupiter Island</p>

<p> The reorganization of the American government after World  War
II--the  creation  of  the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency along
British lines, for example--had devastating consequences.  We are
concerned  here  with  only  certain  aspects  of  that overall
transformation,  thosematters  of  policy and family which gave
shape to the life and mind of <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>, and gave him access to
power.
 It was in these postwar years that <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>  attended  Yale
University,  and  was  inducted into the Skull and Bones society.
The  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  family's  home  at  that  time was in Greenwich,
Connecticut. But it was just then that <ent type='person'>George</ent>'s parents, <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>
and  <ent type='person'>Dorothy</ent>  <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>,  were wintering in a peculiar spot in
Florida, a place that is  excluded  from  mention  in  literature
originating from <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> circles.
 Certain  national  news  accounts  early  in 1991 featured the
observations on President <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s childhood by his elderly  mother
<ent type='person'>Dorothy</ent>.  She  was  said to be a resident of Hobe Sound, Florida.
More precisely, the President's mother lived in a  hyper-security
arrangement  created  a half-century earlier by <ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman,
adjacent to Hobe Sound. Its correct name is Jupiter Island.
 During his political career,  <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  has  claimed  many
different ``home'' states, including Texas, Maine, Massachusetts,
and Connecticut.  <ent type='person'>Ithas</ent>  not  been expedient for him to claim
Florida, though that state has a vital link to his  role  in  the
world, as  we shall see.  And <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>'s home base in Florida,
throughout his adult life, has been Jupiter Island.
 The unique, bizarre setup on Jupiter  Island  beganin  1931,
following themergerof  W.A.  Harriman  and  Co.with  the
British-American firm <ent type='person'>Brown</ent> Brothers.
 The reader will recall Mr. Samuel  <ent type='person'>Pryor</ent>,  the  ``Merchant  of
Death.''  A  partner  with  the  Harrimans, <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>, <ent type='person'>George</ent>
<ent type='person'>Walker</ent>, and Nazi boss  Fritz  Thyssen  in  banking  and  shipping
enterprises,  Sam  <ent type='person'>Pryor</ent> remained executive committee chairman of
Remington Arms. In this period, the Nazi private armies  (SA  and
SS)  were  supplied  with American arms--most likely by <ent type='person'>Pryor</ent> and
his company--as they moved  tooverthrow  theGermanrepublic.
Such  gun-running as an instrument of national policy would later
become notorious in the ``Iran-Contra'' affair.
 Sam <ent type='person'>Pryor</ent>'s daughter <ent type='person'>Permelia</ent> married Yale graduate <ent type='person'>Joseph</ent>  V.
<ent type='person'>Reed</ent>  on  the last day of 1927. <ent type='person'>Reed</ent> immediately went to work for
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  and  <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>,  as  an  apprentice  at  W.A.
Harriman and Co.
 During World  War  II,  <ent type='person'>Joseph</ent>  V. <ent type='person'>Reed</ent>  had  served in the
``special services'' section of the U.S.  ArmySignalCorps.A
specialist  insecurity, codes and espionage, <ent type='person'>Reed</ent> later wrote a
book entitled {Fun with Cryptograms}.s2</p>

<p> Sam <ent type='person'>Pryor</ent> had had property around  Hobe  Sound,  Florida,  for
some time.  In  1931, <ent type='person'>Joseph</ent> and <ent type='person'>Permelia</ent> <ent type='person'>Pryor</ent> <ent type='person'>Reed</ent> bought the
entirety of Jupiter Island.
 This  is  atypically  beautiful  Atlanticcoast``barrier
island,'' a  half-milewide  and nine miles long.  The middle of
Jupiter Islandlies  just  off  Hobe  Sound.  The  south  bridge
connects  the  island  with  the town of Jupiter, to the north of
Palm Beach. It is about 90 minutes by auto from  Miami--today,a
few minutes by helicopter.
 Early in 1991, a newspaper reporter asked a friend of the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
family about security  arrangements  on  Jupiter  Island.  He
responded, ``If you called up the White House,would  they  tell
you how  many  security  people  they had?  It's not that Jupiter
Island is the White House, although he [<ent type='person'>George</ent><ent type='person'>Bush</ent>]  does  come
down frequently.''
 Butfor  several  decades  before <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> was President, Jupiter
Islandhad  an  ordinance requiring the registration and
fingerprinting of all housekeepers,  gardeners,  and  other
non-residents working on the island.  The Jupiter  Island  police
department says that there are sensors in the two main roads that
can track  every automobile on the island.  If a car stops in the
street, the police will be  there  within  oneor  two  minutes.
Surveillance  is  a  duty of all employees of the Town of Jupiter
Island. News reporters are to  be  prevented  from  visiting  the
island.s3
 To  create  this astonishing private club, <ent type='person'>Joseph</ent> and <ent type='person'>Permelia</ent>
<ent type='person'>Pryor</ent> <ent type='person'>Reed</ent> sold land only to those who would fit  in. <ent type='person'>Permelia</ent>
<ent type='person'>Reed</ent> was still the grande dame of the island when <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> was
inaugurated  Presidentin  1989. In recognition of the fact that
the <ent type='person'>Reed</ent>s know where {all} the bodies are buried, President  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
appointed  <ent type='person'>Permelia</ent>'s son, <ent type='person'>Joseph</ent> V. <ent type='person'>Reed</ent>, Jr., chief of protocol
for the U.S. State Dept., in charge of private arrangements  with
foreign dignitaries.
 <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>  Harriman made Jupiter Island a staging ground for his
1940s takeover of the U.S. national security apparatus. It  was
in  that  connection  that  the  island  became possibly the most
secretive private place in America.
 Let us briefly survey the neighborhood, back then in  1946-48,
to  see  some  of  theuses various of the residents had for the
Harriman clique.</p>

<p> Residence on Jupiter Island</p>

<p> sb|Jupiter Islander {<ent type='person'>Robert</ent>A.  <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent>,}s4,  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s
partner  at <ent type='person'>Brown</ent> Brothers Harriman, had been Assistant Secretary
of War for Air from 1941 to 1945. <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent> was the leading American
advocate of the  policy  of  terror-bombing  of  civilians.  He
organized  theStrategic  Bombing  Survey,  carried  out for the
American and British governments by the staff of  the  Prudential
Insurance  Company,  guided  by  London's  Tavistock  Psychiatric
Clinic.
 In the postwar  period,  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  was  associated  with
Prudential  Insurance,one  of <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent>'s intelligence channels to
the British secret services.  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> was listed  by  Prudential
as  a  director  of  the company for about two years in the early
1950s.
 Their Strategic Bombing Survey failed to demonstrate any  real
military advantage accruing from suchoutrages  as  the
fire-bombing  of Dresden, Germany. But the Harrimanites
nevertheless  persisted  in  the advocacy of terror from the air.
They glorified this as ``psychological warfare,'' a part  of  the
utopian  military  doctrine  opposed  to  the  views  of military
traditionalists such as Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
 <ent type='person'>Robert</ent>  <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent>  later  advised  President  Lyndon  <ent type='person'>John</ent>son  to
terror-bomb  Vietnam.  President <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> revived the doctrine
with the bombing of civilian areas in Panama, and the destruction
of Baghdad.
 On October 22, 1945, Secretary of <ent type='person'>War Robert Patterson</ent> created
the <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent> Committee, chaired by <ent type='person'>Robert</ent> A. <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent>, to advise  the
government on  the  post-World  War  II  organization  of  U.S.
intelligence activities.  The existence  of  this  committee  was
unknown  to the public until an official CIA history was released
from secrecy in 1989. But the CIA's  author  (who  wasPresident
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'sprep school history teacher; see chapter 5) gives no real
details of the <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent> Committee's  functioning,  claiming:  ``The
recordof  the testimony of the <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent> Committee, unfortunately,
was not in the archives of  the  agency  when  this  account  was
written.''s5
 TheCIA's  self-history  does  inform  us  of the advice that
<ent type='person'>Lovett</ent> provided to  the  <ent type='person'>Truman</ent>  cabinet,  as  the  official  War
Department intelligence proposal.
 <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent>  decided  that  there  should  be  aseparate  Central
Intelligence Agency. The new agency would  ``consult''with  the
armed  forces,but  it must be the sole collecting agency in the
field of foreign espionage and counterespionage.  The new  agency
shouldhave an independent budget, and its appropriations should
be granted by Congress without public hearings.
 <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent> appeared before the Secretaries of State, War, and Navy
on November 14, 1945. He spoke highly of the FBI's  work  because
it  had  ``thebest personality file in the world.'' <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent> said
the FBI was expert at producing false documents, an  art  ``which
we  developed  so  successfully  during  the  war and at which we
be<ent type='person'>cameout</ent>standingly  adept.''  <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent>  pressed  for  a  virtual
resumption of the wartime Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in a
new CIA.
 U.S.  military  traditionalists  centered  around Gen. Douglas
MacArthur opposed <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent>'s proposal.  The continuation of the OSS
had been attacked at the end of the war on the groundsthat  the
OSS  was  entirely  under  British  control,  and  that  it would
constitute an American Gestapo.s6 But the CIA was established  in
1947  according  to the prescription of <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Robert</ent> <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent></ent>, of Jupiter
Island.
 sb|{<ent type='person'>Charles Payson</ent>} and his wife, {<ent type='person'>Joan Whitney Payson</ent>,}  were
extended  family members of Harriman's and business associates of
the <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> family.
 <ent type='person'>Joan</ent>'s aunt, <ent type='person'>Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney</ent>, was  a  relative  of
the  Harrimans.  Gertrude's son, <ent type='person'>Cornelius Vanderbilt</ent> (``<ent type='person'>Sonny</ent>'')
Whitney, long-time chairman of Pan American Airways (<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> was
a Pan Am director), became assistant secretary of  theU.S.  Air
Force  in  1947.  <ent type='person'>Sonny</ent>'s wife <ent type='person'>Marie</ent> had divorced him and married
<ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman in 1930. <ent type='person'>Joan</ent> and <ent type='person'>Sonny</ent>'s uncle, Air Marshal Sir
<ent type='person'>Thomas Elmhirst</ent>, was director of intelligence for the British Air
Force from 1945 to 1947.
 <ent type='person'>Joan</ent>'s  brother,  <ent type='person'>John</ent>  Hay(``Jock'')  Whitney,  was  to  be
ambassador  toGreat Britain from 1955 to 1961 ... when it would
be vital for <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> and <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>  to  have  such  a  friend.
<ent type='person'>Joan</ent>'sfather,  grandfather, and uncle were members of the Skull
and Bones secret society.
 <ent type='person'>Charles Payson</ent> organized a uranium refinery in 1948. Later, he
was  chairman  of  Vitro  Corporation,makers of parts for
submarine-launched  ballistic  missiles,  equipment for frequency
surveillance  and  torpedo guidance, and other subsurface
weaponry.
 Naval  warfare  haslong  been a preocc<ent type='person'>upa</ent>tion of the British
Empire.  British  penetration  of  theU.S.  Naval  Intelligence
service  has  been  particularly heavy since the tenure of <ent type='person'>Joan</ent>'s
Anglophile grandfather, <ent type='person'>William</ent> C. Whitney, as secretary  of  the
Navy  for  President  Grover  Cleveland.  This traditional covert
British orientation in the U.S. Navy, Naval Intelligence and  the
Navy'sincluded  service,  the Marine Corps, forms a backdrop to
the career of <ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>--and  to  the  whole  neighborhood  on
Jupiter  Island.  Naval  Intelligence maintained direct relations
with gangster boss  Meyer  <ent type='person'>Lansky</ent>  forAnglo-<ent type='person'>Americanpolitical</ent>
operations in  Cuba  during  World  War  II,well  before  the
establishment of the CIA. <ent type='person'>Lansky</ent> officially moved to  Florida  in
1953.s7
 sb|{<ent type='person'>George</ent>  <ent type='person'>Herbert</ent><ent type='person'>Walker</ent>, Jr.} (Skull and Bones, 1927), was
extremely close to his nephew <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>, helping to sponsor his
entry into the oil business in the 1950s.  ``Uncle  <ent type='person'>Herbie</ent>''  was
also  a  partner  of <ent type='person'>Joan Whitney Payson</ent> when they co-founded the
New York Mets baseball team in 1960.  His son, G.H.  <ent type='person'>Walker</ent>  III,
was  aYale  classmate  of  {<ent type='person'>Nicholas Brady</ent>} and <ent type='person'>Moreau</ent> D. <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>
(<ent type='person'>Thatcher</ent> <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>'s grandson), forming what was called  the  ``Yale
Mafia'' on Wall Street.
 sb|{Walter S. <ent type='person'>Carpenter</ent>, Jr.} had been chairman of the finance
committee ofthe  Du  Pont  Corporation  (1930-40).In  1933,
<ent type='person'>Carpenter</ent> oversaw Du Pont's purchase of Remington Armsfrom  Sam
<ent type='person'>Pryor</ent> and the Rockefellers, and led Du Pont into partnership with
the  Nazi  I.G. Farben company for the manufacture of explosives.
<ent type='person'>Carpenter</ent> became Du Pont's president in 1940. His cartel with the
Nazis was broken up bythe  U.S.  government.  Nevertheless,
<ent type='person'>Carpenter</ent> remained Du  Pont's  president,  as  thecompany's
technicians participated massively in the  Manhattan  Project  to
produce the  first  atomic bomb.  He was chairman of Du Pont from
1948 to 1962, retaining high-level  access  toU.S.strategic
activities.
 Walter  <ent type='person'>Carpenter</ent>  and  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> were fellow activists in
the Mental Hygiene Society. Originating  at  Yale  University  in
1908,  the  movement had been organized into the World Federation
of Mental Health by Montague <ent type='person'>Norman</ent>, himself  a  frequent  mental
patient,  former  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>  Brothers  partner  and  Bank  of England
Governor. <ent type='person'>Norman</ent> had  appointed  as  the  federation'schairman,
Brigadier  <ent type='person'>John</ent>  Rawlings Rees, director of the Tavistock Clinic,
chief psychiatrist  and  psychologicalwarfare  expert  for  the
British intelligence  services.  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> was a director of the
society in Connecticut; <ent type='person'>Carpenter</ent> was a director in Delaware.
 sb|{<ent type='person'>Paul Mellon</ent>} was the leading heir to the  Mellon  fortune,
and  along-time  neighbor  of <ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman's in Middleburg,
Virginia, as well as  Jupiter  Island,Florida.  <ent type='person'>Paul</ent>'s  father,
AndrewMellon, U.S. treasury secretary 1921-32, had approved the
transactions of Harriman, <ent type='person'>Pryor</ent>, and <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> with the  <ent type='person'>Warburgs</ent>  and
the Nazis.  <ent type='person'>Paul Mellon</ent>'s son-in-law, {<ent type='person'>David</ent> K.E.  Bruce,} worked
in <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  W.A. Harriman &amp; Co. during the late 1920s;
was head of the London branch of U.S.  intelligence during  World
War  II;  and  was  <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>  Harriman's  Assistant  Secretary  of
Commerce in 1947-48.  Mellon family money and participation would
be instrumental in many domestic U.S. projects of the new Central
Intelligence Agency.
 sb|{<ent type='person'>Carll Tucker</ent>} manufactured electronic  guidanceequipment
for  the  Navy.  With  the  Mellons, <ent type='person'>Tucker</ent> was an owner of South

U.S. treasury secretary.  Their son <ent type='person'>Carll Tucker</ent>, Jr. (Skull  and

 From the late 1940s, Jupiter Island has served as a center for
the direction  of  covert  action  by  the  U.S.  government and,
indeed, for the covert management of  the  government.  Jupiter
Islandwill  reappear later on, in our account of <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> in
the Iran-Contra affair.</p>

<p> Target: Washington</p>

<p> <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> graduated from Yale in 1948. He soon  entered  the
family's  <ent type='person'>Dresser</ent>  oilsupplyconcern  in  Texas.  We shall now
briefly describe the forces that descended  onWashington,  D.C.
duringthose  years when <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>, with the assistance of family and
powerful friends, was becoming ``established in business  on  his
own.''
 From  1948  to 1950, <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s boss <ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman was
U.S.  ``ambassador-at-large'' to Europe. He  was  a  non-military
``Theater   Commander,''   the   administratorof  the
multi-billion-dollar  <ent type='person'>Marshall Plan</ent>, participating in all
military/strategic  decision-makingby the Anglo-American
alliance.
 The U.S. secretary of defense, <ent type='person'>James Forrestal</ent>, hadbecomea
problem to the Harrimanites. <ent type='person'>Forrestal</ent> had long been an executive
at  <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent>  Read  on Wall Street. But in recent years he had gone
astray.  As secretary of the navy in 1944, <ent type='person'>Forrestal</ent> proposed the
racial integration of the Navy. As defense secretary, he  pressed
for  integration  in  the armed forces and this eventually became
the U.S. policy.
 <ent type='person'>Forrestal</ent>  opposed  the  utopians'  strategy  of appeasement
coupled with  brinkmanship. He was simply opposed to communism.
On March 28, 1949, <ent type='person'>Forrestal</ent> was forced out of office  and  flown
on  an Air Force plane to Florida. He was taken to ``Hobe Sound''
(Jupiter Island), where <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Robert</ent> <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent></ent> and  an  army  psychiatrist
dealt with him.s8
 He  was  flown  back to Washington, locked in Walter <ent type='person'>Reed</ent> Army
Hospital and given insulin shock treatments for alleged  ``mental
exhaustion.''  He  wasdeniedall visitors except his estranged
wife and children--his son had been <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>  Harriman's  aide  in
Moscow.  On May 22, <ent type='person'>Forrestal</ent>'s body was found, his bathrobe cord
tied tightly around  his  neck,  afterhe  had  plunged  froma
sixteenth-story hospital  window. The chief psychiatrist called
the death a suicide even before any  investigation  was  started.
The results  of the Army's inquest were kept secret.  <ent type='person'>Forrestal</ent>'s
diaries were published, 80  percent  deleted,  after  a  year  of
direct government censorship and rewriting.
  - * * * -
 North  Korean  troops  invaded South Korea in June 1950, after
U.S.  Secretary of State  Dean<ent type='person'>Acheson</ent>  (Harriman's  very  close
friend)  publicly  specified  that  Korea  would not be defended.
With a new war on, Harriman  came  back  to  serve  asPresident
<ent type='person'>Truman</ent>'s adviser, to ``oversee national security affairs.''
 Harriman replaced <ent type='person'>Clark Clifford</ent>, who had been special counsel
to <ent type='person'>Truman</ent>.  <ent type='person'>Clifford</ent>, however, remained close to Harriman and his
partners as  they  gained  more  and  more power.  <ent type='person'>Clifford</ent> later
wrote about his cordial relations with <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>:
 ``<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> ... had become  oneof  myfrequent  golfing
partners  in  the  fifties,  and  I  had both liked and respected
him....  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> had a  splendid  singingvoice,and  particularly
loved quartet  singing.  In the fifties, he organized a quartet
that  includedmy  daughter  <ent type='person'>Joyce</ent>....  Theywouldsing in
Washington,  and, on occasion, he invited the group to Hobe Sound
in Florida to perform. His  son  [<ent type='person'>George</ent>],  though,  had  never
struck me  as a strong or forceful person.  In 1988, he presented
himself successfully to the voters as an outsider--no small trick
for a man whose roots wound through Connecticut, Yale, Texas oil,
the  CIA,  a  patrician  background, wealth, and the Vice
Presidency.''s9</p>

<p> With  <ent type='person'>Forrestal</ent>  out  of  the  way,<ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman and Dean
<ent type='person'>Acheson</ent> drove to <ent type='person'>Lee</ent>sburg, Virginia, on July 1, 1950, to hire the
British-backed U.S. Gen.  <ent type='person'>George</ent>  C.  Marshallas  secretary  of
defense. At  the  same time, <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>'s partner, <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Robert</ent> <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent></ent>,
himself became assistant secretary of defense.
 <ent type='person'>Lovett</ent>, Marshall,  Harriman,  and  <ent type='person'>Acheson</ent>  went  to  work  to

<p>The Honorable W.A. Harriman, The White House, Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Dear <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>:
 I was sorry to miss you  inWashington  but  appreciate  your
cordial note.  I shall hope for better luck another time.
 I hope you had a good rest at Hobe Sound.
 With affectionate regard, I am,
 Sincerely yours,</p>

<p> A  central focus of the Harriman security regime in Washington
(1950-53)  wasthe  organization  of  covertoperations, and
``psychological  warfare.''  Harriman,together with his lawyers
and business partners, <ent type='person'>Allen</ent> and <ent type='person'>John Foster</ent> Dulles,  wanted  the
government's  secret  <ent type='person'>servicesto</ent>  conduct  extensive propaganda
campaigns and mass-psychology experiments within the U.S.A.,  and
paramilitary campaignsabroad.  This would supposedly ensure a
stableworld-wide  environment favorable to Anglo-American
financial and political interests.
 The Harriman security  regime  created  the  Psychological
Strategy Board (PSB) in 1951. The man appointed director  of  the
PSB, <ent type='person'>Gordon Gray</ent>, is familiar to the reader as the sponsor of the
child  sterilization  experiments, carried out by the Harrimanite
eugenics movement in North Carolina following World War II.
 <ent type='person'>Gordon Gray</ent> was an avid Anglophile, whose  father  had  gotten
controlling ownership  of  theR.J.Reynolds  Tobacco Company
through alliance with the British Imperial tobacco cartel's  U.S.
representatives, the  <ent type='person'>Duke</ent>  family  ofNorth Carolina.  <ent type='person'>Gordon</ent>'s
brother, R.J. Reynolds chairman <ent type='person'>Bowman Gray</ent> Jr., was also a naval
intelligence officer, known around Washington as the ``founder of
operational intelligence.'' <ent type='person'>Gordon Gray</ent> became a close friend and
political ally of  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>;  and  Gray's  son  became  for
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>'s  son,  <ent type='person'>George</ent>, his lawyer and the shield of his covert
policy.
 ButPresident  Harry  <ent type='person'>Truman</ent>,  as  malleable ashe was,
constituted anobstacle  to  the  covert  warriors. An insular
Missouri politician vaguely favorable to the  U.S.  Constitution,
he  remained  skeptical  aboutsecretservice  activities  that
reminded him of the Nazi Gestapo.
 So, ``covert operations'' could not fully take off  withouta
change of  the Washington regime.  And it was with the Republican
Party that <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> was to get his turn.</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> Runs for Senate</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> had made his first attempt to enter national politics
in  1950,  as  his  partners  took  control  of  the  levers of
governmental power.  Remaining  in  charge  of  <ent type='person'>Brown</ent>  Brothers
Harriman, he ran against Connecticut's<ent type='person'>William</ent>  <ent type='person'>Benton</ent>  for  his
seat in  the  U.S.  Senate. (The race was actually for a two-year
unexpired  term,  leftempty  by  <ent type='person'>thedeath</ent>  of  the previous
senator).
 In  those days, Wisconsin's drunken Senator <ent type='person'>Joseph</ent> R. McCarthy
was making a circus-like crusade against communist  influence  in
Washington. McCarthyattacked  liberals  and  leftists,  State
Department personnel, politicians, andHollywood  figures.  He
generally  left  unscathed the Wall Street and London strategists
who donatedEastern Europe and China  tocommunist
dictatorship--like <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>, their geopolitics was beyond left
and right.
 <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  hadno  public  ties  to  the  notorious  Joe
McCarthy, and appeared to be neutral about his crusade.  But  the
Wisconsin senator had his  uses.Joe  McCarthy  came  into
Connecticut three times  that  year  to  campaign  for<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  and
against  the  Democrats.  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>himself  made charges of ``Korea,
Communism and Corruption'' into a slick campaign  phrase  against
<ent type='person'>Benton</ent>, which then turned up as a national Republican slogan.
 The response  was disappointing.  Only small crowds turned out
to hear Joe McCarthy,  and  <ent type='person'>Benton</ent>  was  not  hurt.  McCarthy's
pro-<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  rally  in  New Haven, in a hall that seated 6000, drew
only 376 people.  <ent type='person'>Benton</ent> joked on the radio that  ``200  of  them
were my spies.''
 <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> resigned from the Yale Board of Fellows for his
campaign, and the board published a statement to the effect  that
the  ``Yale  vote''  should  support  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>--despite the fact that
<ent type='person'>Benton</ent> was a Yale man, and in many ways identical in  outlook  to
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent>. Yale's Whiffenpoofsingers  appeared  regularly  for
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>'s campaign.  None of this  was  particularly  effective,
however, with the voting population.s1s0
 Then Papa  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  ran into a completely unexpected problem.  At
that time, the old Harriman eugenics  movementwas  centered  at
Yale University. <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> was a Yale trustee, and his former
<ent type='person'>Brown</ent>  Brothers  Harriman  partner,  Lawrence  <ent type='person'>Tighe</ent>,  was Yale's
treasurer.  In that connection, a slight  glimmer  of  the  truth
about  the  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>-Harriman firm's Nazi activities now made its way
into the campaign.
 Notonly was the American Eugenics Society itself
headquartered  at  Yale,  but  all  parts  of this undead fascist
movement had a busy home at Yale.  Thecoercive  psychiatry  and
sterilization  advocates had made the Yale/New Haven Hospital and
Yale Medical School their laboratories for hands-on  practice  in
brain surgery  and  psychological experimentation.  And the Birth
Control League was there, which had long trumpeted theneed  for
eugenical  births--fewer  births  for  parentswith ``inferior''
bloodlines.  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>'s partner <ent type='person'>Tighe</ent> was a Connecticut  director
of  the  league, and the Connecticut league's medical advisor was
the eugenics advocate, Dr.  Winternitz of Yale Medical School.
 Now in 1950, people who knew  something  about  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
knew  that  <ent type='person'>hehad</ent> very unsavory roots in the eugenics movement.
There were  then,  just  afterthe  anti-<ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>  war,few  open
advocates ofsterilization  of  ``unfit''  or  ``unnecessary''
people.  (That would be revived later, with the help  of  General
<ent type='person'>Draperand</ent> his friend <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent>.) But the Birth Control League
was public--just about then itwas  changing  its  name  to  the
euphemistic ``Planned Parenthood.''
 Then, very late in the 1950 senatorial campaign, <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>
was publicly exposed for being an activist in that section of the
old fascist  eugenics  movement.  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> lost the election
by about 1000 out of 862000 votes.  He and  his  family  blamed
the defeat  onthe  exposeaa.  The  defeat was burned into the
family's memory, leaving a bitterness and perhaps  a  desire  for
revenge.
 In  his  foreword  to  a  population  control propaganda book,
<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>George</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent></ent> wrote  about  that1950  election:  ``My  own  first
awareness  of  birth control as a public policy issue came with a
jolt in 1950 when my father was running for United States  Senate
in Connecticut.  <ent type='person'>Drew Pearson</ent>, on the Sunday before Election day,
`revealed' that my father wasinvolved with Planned
Parenthod....  Many political observers felt a sufficient  number
of  voters  were  swayed  by  his alleged contacts with the birth
controllers to cost him the election....''s1s1
 <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> gave a graphic description ofthese  events  in
his  ``oral  history'' interview at Columbia University: ``In the
1950 campaign, when I ran against <ent type='person'>Benton</ent>,  thevery  last  week,
Drew  Pearson,famouscolumnist, was running a radio program at
that time....  In this particular broadcast, just at the  end  of
our  campaign [Pearson said]: ``I predict that <ent type='person'>Benton</ent> will retain
his seat in the United States Senate, because it  has  just  been
made  known that <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>, his opponent, is president of the
Birth Control Society'' or  chairman,  member  of  theboard  of
directors,  or something, ``of the Birth Control Society. In this
country,  and  of  course  with  Connecticut's heavy Catholic
population,  and its laws against birth control ... this is going
to be too much for <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> to rise above.<ent type='person'>Benton</ent> will  be  elected.
I predict.''
 <ent type='person'>Thenext</ent>  Sunday, they handed out, at these Catholic Churches
in Waterbury and Torrington and  Bridgeport,  handbills,  quoting
Drew  Pearson's  statement  on the radio about <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>, you
see--I predict.  Well, my telephone started ringing  that  Sunday
at home, and when I'd answer, or <ent type='person'>Dotty</ent> [<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>'s wife, <ent type='person'>George</ent>'s
mother]  wouldanswer--``Is  this  true,  what  they  say  about
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>?This can't be true.  Is it true?''
 She'd say, ``No, it isn't true.'' Of course, it  wasn't  true.
But  you  never  catchup with a thing like this--the election's
just day after tomorrow, you see?  So there's no  doubt,  in  the
estimate  of  our  political leaders, that this one thing cost me
many thousand votes--whether it was 1, 3, 5  or  10  thousand  we
don't know,  we  can't possibly tell, but it was enough.  To have
overcome that thousand vote, it would only have  had  to  be  600
switch [sic].
 [Mrs.  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>then  corrected  the  timing  in  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s
recollections.]
 ``I'd forgotten the exact sequence, but that was it....  The
state  then--and  I  think  still  is--probably  about 55 percent
Catholic population,  with  all  the  Italian  derivation  people
[sic],and Polish is very heavy, and the Catholic church is very
dominant here, and the archbishop was death on this birth control
thing. They  fought  repeal  every  time  itcame  up  in  the
legislature,  and {we never did get rid of that prohibition until
just a year or two ago,} as I recall it [emphasis added].s1s2</p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  wasdefeated,  while  the  other Republican
candidates  fared  well in Connecticut. He attributed his loss to
the Catholic Church. After all, he had dependable friends in  the
news media.  The  {New  YorkTimes}loved  him  for his bland
pleasantness.  He just about owned CBS. Twenty  years  earlier,
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>had  personally  organized  the  credit  to allow
<ent type='person'>William</ent> S. Paley to buy the CBS (radio, later television) network
outright.  In return,  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  was  made  a  director  and  the
financial  leader of CBS; Paley himself became a devoted follower
and servitor of <ent type='person'>Averell</ent> Harriman.
 Well, when he tried again, <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> would not  leave  the
outcome to the blind whims of the public.
 <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  moved into action in 1952 as a national leader
of the push to give the  Republican  presidential  nomination  to
Gen. Dwight D. (``<ent type='person'>Ike</ent>'') <ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent>. Among the other team members
were  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s  <ent type='person'>Hitler</ent>-era  lawyer  <ent type='person'>John Foster</ent> Dulles, and Jupiter
Islander C. Douglas <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent>.
 <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent> and his father were the pivots as  the  Harriman-Dulles
combination readied  <ent type='person'>Ike</ent> for the presidency.  As a friend put it:
``When the <ent type='person'>Dillon</ent>s ... invited [<ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent>] to dinner it  was  to
introduce him to Wall Street bankers and lawyers.''s1s3
 <ent type='person'>Ike</ent>'s higher level backers believed, correctly, that <ent type='person'>Ike</ent> would
not  interferewith  even  the  dirtiest  of their covert action
programs.  The bland, pleasant <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  was  <ent type='person'>infrom</ent>  the
beginning:  a  friend  to  <ent type='person'>Ike</ent>,  and  an  original  backer of his
presidency.
 On July 28, 1952, as the  election  approached,  Connecticut's
senior U.S.  senator, James O'Brien McMahon, died at the age of
48. (McMahon had been Assistant U.S. Attorney General, in  charge
of  the  Criminal Division, from 1935 to 1939. Was there a chance
he might someday speak out about the unpunished  Nazi-era  crimes
of the wealthy and powerful?)
 This  was  {extremely}  convenient  for  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>.  He got the
Republican nomination for U.S. senatorat  a  specialdelegated
meeting, with backing bythe  Yale-dominated  state  party
leadership.  Now he would run  in  a  special  election  for  the
suddenly vacant  Senate  seat. He could expect to be swept into
office, since he would be on the same  electoral  ticket  as  the
popular  war  hero,  General  <ent type='person'>Ike</ent>.  Bya  technicality, he would
instantly become Connecticut's senior senator, with  extra  power
in  Congress.  And  the  next regularly scheduled senatorial race
would be in 1956 (whenMcMahon's  term  wouldhave  ended),  so
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  could  run again in that presidential election year ...
once again on <ent type='person'>Ike</ent>'s coattails!</p>

<p> With this arrangement, things worked out very  smoothly.  In
<ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent>'s  1952  election  victory,<ent type='person'>Ike</ent>  won Connecticut by a
margin of 129507 votes out of 1092471. <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>  came  in
last  among  the  statewide  Republicans,  butmanaged to win by
30373out  of  1088799,  his  margin  nearly  100000  behind
<ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent>. He took the traditionally Republican towns.
 In  <ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent>'s  1956  re-election,  <ent type='person'>Ike</ent>  won  Connecticut by
303036 out of 1114954 votes, the largest  presidential  margin
in Connecticut's history.  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> managed to win again, by
129544  votesout  of  1085206--his  margin this time 290082
smaller than <ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent>'s.s1s4
 In January 1963, when this electoral strategy had been  played
out  and  his  second  term  expired,  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> retired from
government and returned to <ent type='person'>Brown</ent> Brothers Harriman.
 The 1952 <ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent> victory made <ent type='person'>John Foster</ent> DullesSecretary
of  State,  and  his  brother  <ent type='person'>Allen</ent>  Dulles head of the CIA. The
reigning Dulles brothers were the ``Republican'' replacements for
their  client  and businesspartner, ``Democrat'' <ent type='person'>Averell</ent>
Harriman. Occasionalpublicposturings aside, their strategic
commitments were identical to his.
 Undoubtedly the most important work accomplished  by  <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>
<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> in the new regime was on the golf links.
 Those  who  remember  the  <ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent> presidency know that <ent type='person'>Ike</ent>
played ...  quite a bit of golf!  Democrats sneered  at  him  for
mindlessness,  Republicans  defended  him for taking this healthy
recreation.  Golf was <ent type='person'>Ike</ent>'s ruling passion. And  there  at  his
side was the loyal, bland, pleasant Senator <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>, former
president  of  the  U.S. Golf Association, son-in-law of the very
man who had reformulated the rules of the game.
 <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent> was <ent type='person'>Dwight Eisenhower</ent>'s favorite  golf  partner.
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  could  reassure  <ent type='person'>Ike</ent>about  his  counselors, allay his
concerns, and monitor his  moods.  <ent type='person'>Ike</ent>  was  very  grateful  to
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>, who never revealed the President's scores.
 Thepublicimage of his relationship to the President may be
gleaned from a 1956 newspaper profile of <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>'s role  in
the party.  The  {New  York  Times,}which 11 years before had
consciously protected him from public exposure as a Nazi  banker,
fawned overhim  in  an  article  entitled,  ``HisPlatform:
<ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent>'':``A tall, lean, well-dressed man who  looks  exactly
like what he is--a wealthy product of the Ivy League--is chairman
of theRepublican  Convention's  platform  committee. As such,
<ent type='person'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>, Connecticut's senior United States Senator, hasa
difficult  task:  he  has to take one word and expand it to about
5000.
 ``The one word, of course, is  `<ent type='person'>Ike</ent>'--but  no  party  platform
could ever be so simple and direct....
 ``Thus  it  is  that  Senator  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>and  his fellow committee
members ... find themselves confronted with the job  of  wrapping
aroundthe  name  <ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent> sufficient verbiage to persuade the
public that it is the principles of the party, and notthe  grin
of  the  man  at  the  head  of  it,  which  makes  itworthy of
endorsement in [the] November [election].
 ``For this task <ent type='person'>Prescott</ent>  <ent type='person'>Bush</ent>,  a  singularly  practical  and
direct conservative,  may  notbe entirely fitted.  It is likely
that left to his own devices he would simply  offer  the  country
the one word and let it go at that.
 ``He  is  ...  convinced  that  this would be enough to do the
trick ... if only the game were played that way.</p>

<p> ``Since it is not, he can be expected to preside with dignity,
fairness and dispatch over the sessions  that  will  prepare  the
party credo for the 1956 campaign.
 ``If  by  chance  there  should  beany  conflicts within the
committee ...  the  Senator's  past  can  offer  a  clue  to  his
conduct.
 ``AformerYale  Glee  Club  and second bass in the All-Time
Whiffenpoofs  Quartet,he is ...[called] `the hottest
close-harmony man at Yale in a span of twenty-five years.'
 ``Close  harmony  being a Republican specialty under President
<ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent>, the hottest close-harmony man at Yale in  twenty-five
years  would seem to be an ideal choice for the convention job he
holds at San Francisco....
 ``[In addition to his business  background,he]  also  played
golf, competing  in  a number of tournaments.  For eight years he
was a member of the executive committee of the United States Golf
Association....
 ``As a Senator, Connecticut's senior  spokeman  in  the  upper
house  has  followed  conservative  policies  consistent with his
business background.
 He resigned all his corporate directorships, took a leave from
<ent type='person'>Brown</ent> Brothers, Harriman, and proceeded to go down theline  for
the <ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent> program....
 ``Around  the  Senate,  he  is  known  as  a  man who does his
committee work faithfully, defends  the  Administration  stoutly,
and fits well into theclublike  atmosphere  of  Capitol
Hill....''s1s5
