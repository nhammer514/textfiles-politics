<xml><p>I notice the now-ancient <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> "Mars Effect" affair continues to 
crop up, perennially, with considerable time-honoured but still-fuzzy 
rhetoric about an alleged CSICOP "cover up", including copious 
laudatory mentions of <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Dennis</ent> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent></ent>'s ALSO-ancient jeremiad 
"sTARBABY", which appeared in "Fate" magazine. Essentially all 
treatments of the affair since then have been loose (and even MORE 
careless) descendants of the <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> article, often committing gross 
distortions, such as confusing the test of <ent type='person'>Eur</ent>opean athletes with the 
later one based on U.S. data. </p>

<p>The ONLY proper rejoinder I've ever seen to <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> was a reply piece 
by CSICOP Fellow P. J. Klass, which "Fate" refused to publish, and 
which far too few have seen, over the years since. <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Robert</ent> Sheaffer</ent>

it more widely. The full text may be downloaded or File REQuested, 
but not FTP'd from my BBS as CRYBABY.ZIP (as <ent type='person'>Robert</ent> mentions in his

<p>    "CRYBABY" </p>

<p>    by Philip J. Klass </p>

<p>Philip J. Klass is a member of the Executive Council, Committee 
for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal 
(CSICOP). </p>

<p> [Note: This article, written in 1981, was submitted for 
 publication to FATE Magazine, in reply to <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Dennis</ent> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent></ent>' 
 accusations against CSICOP in his Oct., 1981 FATE article 
 "sTARBABY". FATE adamantly refused to publish this article. 
 Meanwhile, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> was given the opportunity to make a 
 rambling, six-page statement in the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER 
 (Winter, 1981-82, p.58), which was published exactly as 
 received, presenting his accusations of a "coverup." This 
 was in addition to the 5 1/2 page article he earlier had on 
 the "Mars Effect" in the Winter, 1979-80 issue (p.26). To 
 this day, supporters of the paranormal still charge CSICOP 
 with perpetrating a "coverup" on this matter. Only a 
 relatively few people ever saw Klass's "CRYBABY", the long 
 and detailed answer to <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' "sTARBABY" charges. Now that 
 you have the opportunity to read Klass's rebuttal, you can 
 make up your own mind. </p>

<p> "They call themselves the Committee for the Scientific 
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. In fact, they are a 
group of would-be-debunkers who bungled their major 
investigation, falsified the results , covered up their errors 
and gave the boot to a colleague who threatened to tell the 
truth." Thus began a 32-Page article in the October 1981 issue of 
FATE magazine, which a a press release headlined: "SCIENTIST 
BLOWS THE WHISTLE ON PARANORMAL COVERUP." </p>

<p> Since CSICOP was formed in the spring of 1976, it has been a 
thorn in the side of those who promote belief in "psychic 
phenomena," in astrology, UFOs, and similar subjects and it has 
been criticized sharply by FATE whose articles generally cater to 
those who are eager to believe. However, this FATE article was 
written by skeptic <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Dennis</ent> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent></ent>, who was one of the original 
Fellows in CSICOP and for nearly four years had been a member of 
its Executive Council. This would seem to give credence to 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' charges -- except to those of us with first-hand 
experience in trying to work with him and who are familiar with 
his modus-operandi. </p>

<p> Because <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> proposed my election to CSICOP's Executive 
Council I cannot be charged with animosity toward him, except 
what he later engendered by his actions. And in a recent letter 
to me, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> volunteered that I "was less involved than any 
other active Councillor" in the alleged misdeeds. </p>

<p> The FATE article, entitled "sTARBABY" prompted my own 
investigation into <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' charges. But unlike <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>, who 
relies heavily on his recollection of conversations several years 
earlier, I chose to use hard evidence - published articles, 
memoranda and letters, some of which <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> cites in his 
article. When I requested copies of these letters and memoranda 
from the several principals involved, all of them responded 
promptly and fully except for one -- <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Dennis</ent> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent></ent>, who had 
accused the others of "cover-up" and "censorship." RAWLINS 
REFUSED MY REPEATED REQUESTS TO SUPPLY HARD DATA THAT MIGHT 
CONFIRM HIS CHARGES, AND WHICH ALSO COULD DENY THEM! </p>

<p> The results of my investigation, based on hard data, 
prompted me to conclude that the <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> article should have been 
entitled "CRYBABY," and that an appropriate subtitle would have 
been: "A wounded ego is the root of much evil." </p>

<p> If the editors of FATE had spent only a few hours reading 
published articles cited in the <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> article they could not in 
good conscience have accused CSICOP of "cover-up" or of having 
"falsified the results." Instead, FATE chose to ignore the 
traditional journalistic practice of investigating both sides of 
a controversial issue and publishing both sides, as those accused 
by <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> had done. </p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' charges result from two tests intended to assess 
whether the position of the planet Mars at the time of a person's 
birth has a significant influence on whether he/she becomes a 
"sports champion." This "Mars effect" hypothesis was first 
proposed by France's <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Michel</ent> <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent></ent>, who directs the laboratory 
for the Study of Relations between Cosmic and Psychophysiological 
Rhythms, based on a study of <ent type='person'>Eur</ent>opean champions. </p>

<p> The first of the two tests was performed by <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> 
himself, with results that generally were supportive of the Mars 
effect hypothesis by eliminating a possible objection that first 
had been raised by others, i,e, not CSICOP. The only way in which 
CSICOP, or persons affiliated with it, could be guilty of 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' charges would be if they had refused to publish 
<ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>'s results or had intentionally altered the data in his 
report. NEITHER OCCURRED. Nor did <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> accuse CSICOP or its 
members of trying to "cover-up" his results or altering the data 
of this first test whose calculations he himself performed, 
although there were some differences of interpretation of the 
implication of these results. </p>

<p> HOWEVER, GAUQUELIN DID PUBLICLY ACCUSE RAWLINS OF DISTORTION 
AND MISREPRESENTATION, with implied criticism of CSICOP because 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> then was a member of its Executive Council. There would 
be other occasions when CSICOP would be criticized because of 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' intemperate statements and actions. </p>

<p> This criticism was published by CSICOP in the Winter l978 
issue of its publication, THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER (p. 80). In it 
<ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> wrote: "How, in spite of all this data could one 
distort and misrepresent the effect in question and sow doubts on 
the subject? <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Dennis</ent> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent></ent>, a member of CSICP ... has done just 
this in a polemic which appeared in the Fall-Winter 1977 issue of 
that (CSICOP's) journal." In "sTARBABY," <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> tries to shift 
the blame for his transgressions to CSICOP. </p>

<p> According to "sTARBABY," CSICOP Chairman Prof. <ent type='person'>Paul <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent></ent> 
was the principal architect of the alleged cover-up. Yet in 
reality it was <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent>, then editor of THE HUMANIST magazine 
(published by the American Humanist Assn.) who printed the 
lengthy paper by <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> describing the seemingly favorable- 
for-him results of the first test in the Nov/Dec,l977 issue (p. 
30). What kind of doubletalk is this when <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> and FATE charge 
that <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent>'s decision to publish test results favorable to an 
"adversary" represents a "cover-up"? <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> might better have 
waited until "l984" to resort to such "double-speak" accusations. </p>

<p> Because the issues are complex and because two different 
publications and organizations were involved, it is useful to 
recount briefly the events that led to the first Mars effect 
test, which is at the root of the <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>/FATE charges, and the 
second tests performed using data for outstanding U.S. athletes. 
Based on calculations performed by <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> himself, the U.S. 
champions test showed a very UNFAVORABLE result for the claimed 
Mars effect, which <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> confirms in "sTARBABY." And these 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>-computed results were published, without change, by 
CSICOP. </p>

<p> The Sept/Oct. l975 issue of THE HUMANIST carried an article 
by L.E. <ent type='person'>Jerome</ent> that was critical of astrology in general and of 
the Mars effect in particular. When <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> sought an 
opportunity for rebuttal, <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> provided it in the Jan./Feb. 1976 
issue of THE HUMANIST, which also carried several other articles 
on astrology. Because <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>'s article claimed that the 
Mars effect had been confirmed by Belgian Committee for the 
Scientific Investigation of Alleged Paranormal Phenomena (created 
some 25 years earlier), that group also was invited by <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> to 
submit an article for publication. Belgian Comite Para, as it is 
called, confirmed <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>'s calculations. But it questioned his 
statistical assumption "that the frequency distribution of the 
hours of birth during the day (the nych-themeral curve) is a 
constant distribution...", i.e. that there is an equal 
probability of a person being born during any hour of the day. </p>

<p> This seemed important because the Mars effect hypothesis 
holds that persons born during an approximately two-hour period 
just after Mars has "risen" or during a comparable period after 
Mars is at upper culmination (zenith), are more likely to become 
sports champions than persons born during other hours of the day. 
If there is an equal probability of a person being born in any 
one of the 24 hours, then 4/24, or l6.7%,of the general 
population should be born when Mars is in one of these two "key 
sectors." (Because of combined orbital motions of Earth and Mars, 
the percentage of the day in which Mars is in two key sectors is 
approximately l7%. But <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> reported that 22% <ent type='person'>Eur</ent>opean 
champions in his data base had been born when Mars was in the two 
key sectors, significantly higher than the l7% "benchmark." </p>

<p> Because of the issue raised by Comite' Para, <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> 
consulted statistics professor <ent type='person'>Marvin <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent></ent> who in turn proposed a 
control test that could resolve the statistical issue raised by 
Comite' Para. This <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent> proposed test, also published in the 
same (Jan./Feb. 1976) issue of THE HUMANIST, suggested that 
<ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> should gather birth data for "non-champions" who had 
been born in the same local areas and within three days of a 
RANDOMLY SELECTED sub-sample of <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>'s "champions" who 
seemed to show the Mars effect. </p>

<p> If only 17% of these NON-champions were born when Mars was 
in the two key sectors, this would void the issue raised by 
Comite Para. But if roughly 22% of the NON-champions also were 
born when Mars was in the two key sectors, this would undercut 
the Mars effect hypothesis. <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent>'s article concluded that the 
proposed test offered "an objective way for unambiguous 
corroboration or dis-confirmation." In retrospect it would have 
been more precise had he added: "...of the issue raised by 
Belgian Comite Para." If <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>'s sample of "champions" data 
was "biased," as <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> first suspected, this could not possibly 
be detected by the <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent>-proposed test. </p>

<p> The same issue of The Humanist carried another article, by 
astronomy professor <ent type='person'>George</ent> O. <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent>, which was very skeptical of 
astrology in general. But unlike <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> who dismissed the Mars 
effect out-of-hand and "didn't believe that it merited serious 
investigation yet" (FATE: p. 74), <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> wrote that if <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>'s 
findings were correct, they were "extremely interesting." </p>

<p> However, <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> included the following note of caution: "If 
all of <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>'s work is re-checked, and his results hold up, 
then it is necessary to repeat the experiment with a new sample, 
say in the United States. If that sample should give the same 
result, then further verification is in order, until it is 
absolutely certain that the effects are real and reproducible. 
That is the way science works; reproducibility of results is 
necessary before fundamental new laws can be inferred." This sage 
advice clearly indicated the limits of what conclusions could be 
drawn, and could not be drawn, from the results of the upcoming 
<ent type='person'>Zelen</ent> test, and even from a complete re-check of <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>'s 
original data on <ent type='person'>Eur</ent>opean champions, which was not attempted. It 
should be stressed that at the time this first (<ent type='person'>Zelen</ent>) test was 
proposed, CSICOP did not yet exist. Several months later, when it 
was formed (initially under the auspices of the American Humanist 
Assn.), <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> became its co-chairman and later its chairman. 
<ent type='person'>Zelen</ent> and <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> were named Fellows, but not to CSICOP's Executive 
Council. In l980, <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> was elected to replace <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> on the 
Council. </p>

<p> The results of this first (<ent type='person'>Zelen</ent>) test were published in the 
Nov./Dec., l977 issue of THE HUMANIST, where the issue first was 
raised, although by this time CSICOP had its own publication. 
<ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> and his wife <ent type='person'>Francoise</ent> were given nearly six large-size 
magazine pages to present their findings without censorship. 
<ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> reported having difficulties in obtaining data for non- 
champions born within several days of champions in small towns, 
so he said that non-champions birth data had been obtained only 
from the large cities in France and Belgium, The <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>s 
reported that these data showed that only l7% of the non- 
champions had been born when Mars was in the two sectors which 
seemed to resolve the issue earlier raised by Belgium's Comite 
Para in favor of the Mars effect. </p>

<p> The same issue of THE HUMANIST carried an article jointly 
authored by <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent>, <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent>, and <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent>, that began: "Is there a 
'Mars Effect'? The preceding article by <ent type='person'>Michel</ent> and <ent type='person'>Francoise</ent> 
<ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> discusses the experiment proposed by <ent type='person'>Marvin <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent></ent> and 
its subsequent outcome. Their conclusions come out in favor of 
the existence of a 'Mars effect' related to sports champions. It 
is the purpose of this article to discuss the analysis of the 
data and to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the 
evidence in favor of the 'Mars effect.'" </p>

<p> The <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent>/<ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent>/<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> article raised some questions about 
the results. For example, that "the 'Mars effect' only appears in 
Paris, not in Belgium or in the rest of France." The article 
concluded: "lf one had a high prior 'belief' that there is a Mars 
effect, then the <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> data would serve confirm this prior 
belief. In the other hand, if the prior belief in the existence 
of a Mars effect was low, then this data may raise the posterior 
belief, but not enough to accept the existence of the Mars 
effect." </p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> charges that publication of this article, following 
the uncensored <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> paper,"commited CSICOP to a cover-up." 
(FATE: p.76) Yet is characteristic of scientific controversy for 
one party to question or challenge another's interpretation of 
the data. And <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> would do so following the second test 
without being accused of a "cover-up" in "sTARBABY." </p>

<p> In the same issue of THE HUMANIST, in a brief introduction 
written by <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent>, the first "linkage" with CSICOP occurred. <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> 
wrote: "Thus, members of CSICOP involved in this inquiry believe 
that the claim that there is a statistical relationship between 
the position of Mars at the time of birth of individuals and the 
incidence of sports champions among them has not been established 
.. to further the cause of scientific inquiry, the committee has 
agreed (with <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>) to make an independent test of the 
alleged Mars effect by a study of sports champions in the United 
States." </p>

<p> In "sTARBABY," <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> charges that the U. S, champions test 
was a "diversion." Clearly the <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>s themselves did not view 
it in this light, judging from the concluding statement in their 
article which said: "Let us hope that these positive results may 
induce other scientists to study whether this effect, discovered 
with the <ent type='person'>Eur</ent>opean data, appears also with the U.S. data." </p>

<p> On March 28, 1978, SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER THE RESULTS OF THE 
FIRST TEST WERE PUBLISHED, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> sent <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> a copy of a three- 
page memorandum he had prepared a year earlier (March 29, 1977). 
It contained a very technical analysis of the issue raised by 
Comite Para, which prompted <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> to conclude that the 22% 
figure reported for <ent type='person'>Eur</ent>opean champions was not the result of a 
disproportionate share of births of the general population during 
the early morning hours when Mars often was in one of the two key 
sectors. In this analysis, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> concluded that <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> had 
"made fair allowance for the effect." </p>

<p> But <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> had not written this three-page memo until 
several month AFTER the <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent> test had been proposed in THE 
HUMANIST. Shortly after preparing the analysis, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> had sent 
a copy to Prof. <ent type='person'>Marcello <ent type='person'>Truzzi</ent></ent>, then editor of CSICOP's 
publication. <ent type='person'>Truzzi</ent> had decided not to publish it but sent a copy 
to <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>. IF the <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> analysis of 1977 took account of all 
possible demographic factors -- and there is some disagreement on 
this question -- it was much too technical to be understood by 
persons without expertise in statistics and celestial mechanics. </p>

<p> When <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> finally got around to sending this analysis to 
<ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> on March 28, 1978, his letter of that date did NOT 
criticize <ent type='person'>Truzzi</ent> or CSICOP for not having published it earlier. 
Rather, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> admitted, "I should not have kept my (Mar. 19, 
1977) memo..private after all." He did suggest that perhaps it 
might now be published in THE HUMANIST. But by this time <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> no 
longer was its editor. More important, the results of the first 
(<ent type='person'>Zelen</ent>) test already had been published several months earlier. </p>

<p>If, as <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> would later charge in "sTARBABY," the 
<ent type='person'>Zelen</ent>/<ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent>/<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> article published several months earlier in THE 
HUMANIST amounted to a "cover- up," <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> did not make such an 
accusation to <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> when he wrote him April 6, 1978. Instead, 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> wrote; "I think our best bets now are 1. The main 
<ent type='person'>Eur</ent>opean investigation might seek to discover how the <ent type='person'>Eur</ent>. samp 
(of <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>) was (hypothetically) fudged -- check orig. records 
microscopically for some sort of Soal trick. 2. Proceed with the 
U.S, test, where we know we have a clean (unbiased) sample." </p>

<p> This April 6, 1978, letter clearly shows that while <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> 
suspected that <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> had manipulated his <ent type='person'>Eur</ent>opean champions 
data ("Soal trick") he found no evidence of wrong-doing by 
<ent type='person'>Zelen</ent>/<ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent>/<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent>. On April 26, 1978, in another letter to <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent>, 
following his visit with <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> in San Diego, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> wrote that 
he "was certain" that <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>'s original data "was biased, but 
not sure how." <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> concluded this letter on a cordial note: 
"Now, wasn't it great visiting sunny, funny, California -- and 
getting to see a real live nut religion launch itself in San 
Diego? ... hope you'll get back this way soon again." </p>

<p> It was at about this time that CSICOP came under fire for 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' actions in another matter. In the summer of 1977, 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> and <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> had been invited to be panelists in a symposium 
on astrology to be held March 18, 1978 at the University of 
Toronto at which <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>, among others, would participate. The 
invitation came from Dr. <ent type='person'>Howard <ent type='person'>Eisenberg</ent></ent> on the stationary of 
the University's School of Continuing Studies. Both <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> and 
<ent type='person'>Abel</ent> had accepted. Then, in late September, 1977, <ent type='person'>Eisenberg</ent> 
withdrew the invitations on the grounds that "the response from 
potential speakers...has yielded an incredible acceptance rate of 
100%. This places us in the embarassing position of not being 
able to sponsor all of you," i.e. pay travel expenses and allow 
formal presentations. </p>

<p> On Feb. 6, 1978, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> wrote to the president of the 
University of Toronto, protesting what he said were "a number of 
oddities" associated with the symposium, including an imbalance 
between the number of astrology supporters and skeptics. The 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> letter charged that "this conference looks to be a pretty 
phoney confrontation, which will therefore give the irrational 
pseudo-science of astrology an evidentially-unmerited 'academic' 
boost in public credibility..." <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> sent a copy of his letter 
to another university official. </p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' suspicion of a loaded panel may have been 
justified. But the letter of protest was written on CSICOP 
stationery and signed "<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Dennis</ent> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent></ent>, Executive Council, 
CSICOP." Another regretable action was a <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> telephone call 
late at night to a university astronomy professor, <ent type='person'>Robert</ent> 
<ent type='person'>Garrison</ent>, which gave the impression that <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> was speaking in 
behalf of CSICOP. In fact, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> had taken these actions 
without consulting other Council members and without official 
approval to use CSICOP's name. In early April 1978, a copy of the 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> letter had reached <ent type='person'>Truzzi</ent>, who also had been invited and 
dis-invited to participate in the conference. The <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> letter 
claimed that <ent type='person'>Truzzi</ent> had co-authored "an astrology-supporting 
paper...and so rates as a strange sort of skeptic." <ent type='person'>Truzzi</ent> sent 
<ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> a copy of this <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> letter with a note that said: "Since 
<ent type='person'>Dennis</ent>' letter is on Committee stationery, would appear he is 
writing on behalf of the Committee, I trust that will not happen 
again." </p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' actions were reported in the Canadian magazine 
SCIENCE FORUM July/August 1978, in an article written by Lydia 
Dotto. The article, entitled "Science Confronts 'Pseudo- 
Science'", began; "It was after midnight on a Saturday night when 
University of Toronto astronomer <ent type='person'>Bob <ent type='person'>Garrison</ent></ent> was awakened by a 
phone call. The caller identified himself as a member of the 
Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the 
Paranormal, and according to <ent type='person'>Garrison</ent>, he spent the best part of 
the next hour urging the U of T scientist not to participate in 
the conference on astrology...<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Dennis</ent> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent></ent>, a California 
astronomer and science writer and a member of the Committee, 
acknowledged in an interview that he made the call, but denied he 
was trying to talk <ent type='person'>Garrison</ent> out of attending the 
conference...this and other incidents surrounding the conference 
have become something of a cause celebre, particularly since the 
event was cancelled shortly before it was to have taken place in 
mid-March. Predictably, ACCUSATIONS BEGAN TO FLY THAT SCIENTIFIC 
OPPONENTS OF ASTROLOGY WERE ENGAGED IN A CAMPAIGN TO SUPPRESS 
FREEDOM OF SPEECH." (Emphasis added.) </p>

<p> Indeed they did, much to CSICOP's embarassment. Britain's 
New Scientist magazine, in its June 29, 1978, issue, quoted the 
Canadian magazine in an article that began: "Earlier this year an 
astronomer at the University of Toronto, Dr. <ent type='person'>Bob <ent type='person'>Garrison</ent></ent>, was 
awakened by a phone call from a member of Committee for the 
Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. The caller 
allegedly spent most of the next hour trying to dissuade <ent type='person'>Garrison</ent> 
from taking part in a conference on astrology." </p>

<p> This New Scientist account was picked up by FATE magazine, 
which in turn attributed the action to CSICOP rather than to one 
Council member. FATE commented: "If you have difficulty 
understanding their (CSICOP) motives, remember that here is a 
dedicated group of witch-hunters seeking to burn nonbelievers at 
the stake." (How ironic that FATE now is promoting the views of 
the same person whose intemperate earlier actions had provoked 
FATE's harsh criticism.) The same criticism of CSICOP, because of 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' actions surfaced again in a feature article in THE 
WASHINGTON POST (Aug. 26, 1979). The article, syndicated and 
published elsewhere, was written by <ent type='person'>Ted Rockwell</ent> who was 
identified as a member of the Parapsychological Association. </p>

<p> When I learned of the <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> incident, I was shocked as 
were others on the Council. But all of us hoped that Council 
members had learned an important lesson from the incident and 
that it would have a maturing effect on <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>. Yet before 
another year had passed <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> would once again demonstrate his 
inability to distinguish between official CSICOP actions and 
those of its individual members. </p>

<p> Originally it was expected that the required calculations of 
Mars' position at the time of birth of U.S. champions (for the 
second test) would be performed by Prof. <ent type='person'>Owen Gingerich</ent> of 
Harvard University. But during the summer of 1978 the Harvard 
astronomer was on an extended leave so <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> asked <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> to 
perform the celestial mechanics computations. <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> did so and 
found in sharp contrast to <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>'s findings that 22% of the 
<ent type='person'>Eur</ent>opean champions were born when Mars was in the two key 
sectors, and compared to the "chance" benchmark figure of 17%, 
only 13.5% of the U.S. champions were born when Mars was in the 
two key sectors. Thus, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' calculations showed that if Mars 
had any effect on champions, it was a pronounced NEGATIVE effect 
for U.S. athletes. </p>

<p> On Sept, 18, 1978, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> prepared a four-page report 
describing the procedures he had used in his calculations and a 
summary of the results. But <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> could not resist including 
some denigrating charges against <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>. For example: 
"<ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> was well known in his teens for his casting of 
horoscopes (a practice he has since disowned)..." The comments 
were both gratuitous and inappropriate. </p>

<p> Relations between <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> and <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> had been strained 
since CSICOP published a long, rambling <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> attack 
(Fall/Winter 1977) in which he accused <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> of "misgraphing 
the results of the Belgian Comite Para check on his Mars-athletes 
link..." <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> had responded with the charge that <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> had 
distorted and misrepresented the facts in a letter which then was 
scheduled to be published shortly in the Winter 1978 issue of THE 
SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. The same issue also would carry a sharp 
rejoinder from <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>. </p>

<p> Thus it is hardly surprising that <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> decided that it 
would be best if the upcoming summary report on the results of 
the U.S. champions test should be written by <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent>, <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> and 
himself -- especially since the three of them had jointly 
authored the earlier article and <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> had proposed the U.S. 
test. If <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> instead had suggested that the U.S. champions test 
report be jointly authored with <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> instead of <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent>, 
"sTARBABY" might never have been published. This is evident from 
numerous <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> complaints in "sTARBABY." For example, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> 
complains that the day after <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> received his Sept. 18, 1978, 
report (with the ad hominem attack on <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>) "<ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> wrote 
<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> to suggest KZA (<ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent>, <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent> and <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent>) confer and prepare 
the test report for publication (EXCLUDING ME)." (Emphasis 
added.) (P.79.) </p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> also complains that <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> asked <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent> and <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> "to 
verify the work," i.e. <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' calculations. (P.80.) Because of 
the importance of test, it was good scientific protocol to ask 
other specialists to at least spot-check <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' computations. 
Then <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> reveals he was angered because "<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> asked 
countless questions about my academic training." (P. 8O.) 
Inasmuch as <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> lists his academic training as being in 
physics rather than astronomy, <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent>'s questions seem justified. </p>

<p> Further evidence of <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' wounded ego is his complaint 
that "not only was <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> being invited to the press conference 
(at the upcoming Council in Washington, D.C.), he was to be the 
CSICOP spokesman on astrology in Washington." (P.81) <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> said 
he "strongly protested the high-handedness of the choice of <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> 
as the speaker at the annual meeting...I emphasized that CSICOP 
had plenty of astronomers associated with it (Carl <ent type='person'>Sagan</ent>, Bart 
Bok, Edwin Krupp and others), all of them nearer Washington than 
<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> who lived all the way across the country, in the Los 
Angeles area." (In fact, Krupp also lived in Southern California, 
Bok lived Arizona, and <ent type='person'>Sagan</ent> then was working in California on 
his "Cosmos" television series.) </p>

<p> In "sTARBABY," <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> claims that <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> had been invited to 
speak because "<ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> was trying to suppress my dissenting report 
(of Sept. 18, 1978) and (by not paying my travel fare) to keep me 
from the December Council meeting while inviting to Washington as 
a prominent CSICOP authority the very person whose appointed task 
I HAD MYSELF PERFORMED" (his italics, p. 81). In reality, there 
was no question that <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' Sept, 18, 1978, report, describing 
his analytical procedures, needed to be published. The only 
question was whether it should include the ad hominem attack on 
<ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>. </p>

<p> It was not until approximately one year AFTER the results of 
the <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent> test were published in THE HUMANIST that <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> first 
charged the use of "bait-and-switch" tactics--what he calls 
"BS"--had been employed. This allegation was contained in his 
letter of Nov. 2, 1978, to <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent>, with a copy to <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent>. BUT 
RAWLINS STILL DID NOT CHARGE THAT THIS AMOUNTED TO A "COVER-UP," 
OR THAT CSICOP WAS INVOLVED. Quite the opposite. A few weeks 
later when the Winter 1978 issue of THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER was 
published, there was a <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> response which said: "It SHOULD BE 
CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THAT CSICOP AS A BODY NEVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO 
WITH THE HUMANIST ZELEN TEST 'CHALLENGE'...PUBLISHED BEFORE THE 
COMMITTEE WAS FOUNDED"(Emphasis added.) </p>

<p> Like most members of CSICOP's Executive Council who had not 
been involved either in the first (<ent type='person'>Zelen</ent>) test or the subsequent 
U.S. champions test, and who were not sufficiently expert in 
celestial mechanics, statistics or astrology to take a prior 
interest, my first exposure to the controversy came during the 
Council meeting in Washington in early December, 1978, when 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> unleashed a rambling harrangue. Understandably I was 
confused by <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' charge that CSICOP somehow was involved in a 
<ent type='person'>Zelen</ent> test-results cover-up that had occurred more than a year 
before which contradicted his just-published statement in THE 
SKEPTICAL INQUIRER stating that the original <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent> test was NOT a 
CSICOP-sponsored effort. </p>

<p> Despite my efforts to understand <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' allegations, it 
was not clear to me (and to many other Council members) just what 
it was that he now was claiming had been"covered-up." After three 
years of working with <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> I was well aware of his proclivity 
for making harsh, exaggerated charges. Most often these were 
directed against supporters of the para-normal, but sometimes 
also against Council members who disagreed with his proposals for 
intemperate actions against "the believers." For example, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> 
had charged that <ent type='person'>Truzzi</ent> was involved with the "Church of Satan." </p>

<p>Beyond having difficulty in understanding the specifics of 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' charges, I failed to grasp what he thought should be 
done to correct the alleged problem. Because the hour was getting 
late and Council members had to leave to catch flights back home, 
I suggested to <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> that he write a memorandum that clearly 
and concisely set forth the basic issues and that he recommend 
appropriate corrective action. In this way Council members could 
better comprehend the matter and consider corrective action if 
such were justified. <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> cites this in "sTARBABY" and claims 
he was the only party who had put the issues in writing. BUT HE 
DID NOT SEND COPIES OF SUCH MEMORANDA TO COUNCIL MEMBERS. ONE 
LOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR THIS IS THAT PREVIOUSLY HE DID NOT 
BELIEVE THE MATTER INVOLVED CSICOP OR REQUIRED COUNCIL MEMBERS' 
ATTENTION. </p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> was the last one to leave my apartment (where we had 
been meeting that night) and he continued his earlier harrangue 
but without clarifying the issues. Later, he called me from the 
airport to continue the discussion. Again I asked that he clarify 
the issues for me and other Council members by preparing a 
memorandum. I assured <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> that since I had not been involved 
in either of the two tests and since he had recommended my 
election to Council, he could expect me to be at least neutral if 
not sympathetic. </p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> never responded to my request. About six weeks later 
(Jan. 17, 1979), he did circulate a five-page memo to CSICOP 
Fellows and Council members. It was a "baby sTARBABY" which cited 
a number of ALLEGED mistakes that had been made by OTHERS 
involved in the tests and in CSICOP's operations. I replied on 
Jan. 31 saying that his memo was "for me an unintelligible 
jumble." I added: "without meaning to give offense to a friend, I 
once again urge you -- as I did at our meeting here -- to outline 
the problem...then outline your recommendations. And please do 
not assume, as you have done, that all of us follow the G-affair 
as closely as you have done." My letter concluded: "Skip the 
invective...outline the problem clearly, concisely, and offer 
your recommendations." </p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> never responded to this request. Today, following my 
recent investigation, I know why. There was no cover-up, except 
in <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' troubled mind, fed by the fires of a wounded ego and, 
perhaps, by embarassment over his unauthorized intervention in 
the University of Toronto symposium. <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> was unable to 
recommend specific corrective action because nothing could have 
saved his wounded ego unless it were possible to turn back the 
clock and to have invited <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> to be the CSICOP speaker on 
astrology in Washington and to replace <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> in writing the 
report on the results of the U.S. champions test. </p>

<p> Readers of "sTARBABY" might easily conclude that <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> 
believes that <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent>/<ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent>/<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent>, in the Nov/Dec. 1977 issue of 
THE HUMANIST, should have conceded "<ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> has won" and 
cancelled plans for the U.S. champions test. Yet had they done 
so, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> would have been outraged because such a concession 
would imply that the <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent> test had proved the Mars effect beyond 
all doubt and this was not true. Had <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent>/<ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent>/<ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> even 
contemplated such a concession, I am certain that <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> would 
have urged that they be ousted from CSICOP. </p>

<p> "sTARBABY" reveals that <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> imagines many things that 
simply are not true, such as his charge that I was involved in a 
plot to suppress his discussions of the <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent> test at the 
1978 Council meeting. His article implies that Council meetings 
are characterized by attempts to suppress dissenting views. In 
reality one usually hears almost as many different viewpoints as 
there are Council members present. And <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> is the most 
unconstraining group chairman I have ever known in the many 
organizations of which I have been a member. </p>

<p> Even on easily ascertainable matters, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> chooses to 
rely on his vivid imagination or recollections rather than take 
time to check the facts. For example, in "sTARBABY," <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> 
claims that he was an "associate editor" of THE SKEPTICAL 
INQUIRER, as well as being a member of its editorial board -- 
which he was [not]. <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> makes that claim in seven different 
places in his article. One would expect that a person who 
imagines himself to be an associate editor of a publication over 
a period of several years would at least once look at that 
publication's <ent type='person'>masthead</ent>, where its editorial staff is listed. Had 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> done so he would not have made this spurious claim. </p>

<p> This is not an error of great consequence. But when I 
pointed it out to him, his response was revealing, especially 
because he accuses others of being unwilling to admit to error 
and of resorting to "cover-up." <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' letter of Sept. 21, 
1981, explained that at a Council meeting HELD FOUR YEARS EARLIER 
he remembers that "<ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> called all Ed. Board members 'Associate 
Editors'...I adopted to save syllables." <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> tries to justify 
his misstatement of fact on the grounds that he was able to save 
approximately 42 characters in his 75000-character-long article! </p>

<p> In "sTARBABY," <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> claims that the full-day meeting of 
the Council in Washington was held at the National Press Club 
because this was "the temple of CSICOP's faith." (P. 86.) Had 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> asked me, I would have informed him that I had selected 
the National Press Club because it was the lowest-cost facility 
in downtown Washington that I could find. But <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> decided he 
knew the answer without bothering to investigate. This is neither 
good science nor good journalism. </p>

<p> In the previously cited <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> memorandum of Jan. 17, 1979, 
following the Washington meeting, he wrote that he planned to 
reduce his involvement with CSICOP. He added that there was no 
reason to "hide" CSICOP's problems "from the public. So I may 
inform a neutral, responsible, unsensational member of the press 
re the foregoing." In reality <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> already had taken such 
steps at the December Council meeting whose press seminar was 
attended by an experienced journalist with a known empathy for 
some paranormal claims. During the early afternoon <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> and 
this journalist left the meeting together and returned together 
several hours later. But this journalist never published anything 
on the matter, possibly because he has as much difficulty in 
understanding <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' charges as did Council members. </p>

<p> According to "sTARBABY," in mid-1979, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> received a 
letter from <ent type='person'>Jerome</ent> Clark of FATE magazine, expressing an interest 
in learning more about <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' complaints against CSICOP. 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> claims that shortly afterward "I told the Council I'd be 
open with FATE." I question the truthfulness of his statement 
because <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> did not bother to attend the next Council meeting 
in December, 1979, nor have I been able to locate any <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> 
letter or memorandum to substantiate this claim. </p>

<p> "sTARBABY" claims that "as the FATE-story realization set 
in, Council reacted like the White House when it learned that 
<ent type='person'>John Dean</ent> had sat down with the prosecution (during the Watergate 
scandal). (P.91) This claim I know to be false. The prospect of a 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> article in FATE was never discussed at the 1979 or 1980 
Council meetings, nor by memorandum during the two intervening 
years. Otherwise CSICOP would have prepared a response which it 
could have released immediately following publication of 
"sTARBABY," preventing <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> from boasting that failure of 
CSICOP to respond quickly to his many charges indicated an 
inability to do so. </p>

<p> Returning, chronologically, to the fall of 1979, CSICOP was 
preparing to publish the results of the U.S. champions test in 
the Winter 1979-80 issue of THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> 
demanded the right to revise and expand his original Sept, 18, 
1978, paper, and was given that opportunity. Furthermore, 
according to "sTARBABY," <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> informed <ent type='person'>Ken <ent type='person'>Frazier</ent></ent>, editor of 
THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, "that if there were any alterations not 
cleared with me, I wanted a note printed with the paper stating 
that deletions had occurred over the author's protest and that 
the missing portions could be obtained directly from me." (P. 
92.) </p>

<p> <ent type='person'>Frazier</ent> (who had been recommended for the position by 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> himself), acting on the recommendation of Prof. Ray 
Hyman, a Council member who reviewed the <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> paper and the 
others, and on <ent type='person'>Frazier</ent>'s own long editorial experience, decided 
to delete the sentence referring to <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>'s earlier interest 
in traditional astrology. <ent type='person'>Frazier</ent> also opted to delete another 
sentence that read: "In this connection I must also say that, 
given the self piekill upshot (sic) of their <ent type='person'>Eur</ent>opean 
(nonchampions) adventure plus their failure to perform 
independently the U.S. study's technical foundations (sector 
position, expectation curve), I find it amusing that ZKA (<ent type='person'>Zelen</ent>, 
<ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent>, <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent>) are the main commentators on this test in THE 
SKEPTICAL INQUIRER." Once again <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' wounded-ego had 
manifested itself. </p>

<p> On Nov, 6, 1979, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> sent a memo to other members of the 
Editorial Board complaining that his article "has been neatly 
censored here and there, so I have asked to add a statement 
saying so and suggesting that readers who wish to consult the 
original version may do so by contacting me. This sentence has 
itself been bowdlerized (so that it reads as if no tampering 
occurred)." <ent type='person'>Frazier</ent> had proposed an alternative sentence, which 
was published at the end of the <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> paper, that read: 
"Further commentary on the issues raised in this paper and in 
these notes is available from the author." <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' address also 
was published. </p>

<p> This is the basis for <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' harsh charges of "censorship" 
against <ent type='person'>Frazier</ent>, the man whom he had so highly recommended for the 
position. If <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' complaint were justified, every working 
journalist could make the same accusations regularly against 
those who edit his/her copy to assure clarity and good taste and 
to avoid libel. In response to <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' charges, <ent type='person'>Frazier</ent> wrote to 
members of the Editorial Board explaining what had transpired. 
<ent type='person'>Frazier</ent> noted, "<ent type='person'>Dennis</ent> seems to believe his position as a member 
of the Editorial Board gives his writings special status exempt 
from normal editorial judgment. None of the rest of you has ever 
suggested this," i.e. demanded privileged treatment. So because 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> was not given privileged treatment, he charges 
"censorship." </p>

<p> In the same Nov. 6, 1979, letter charging censorship, 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> complained that he alone among Council members had not 
been reimbursed for his travel expenses of $230 to the previous 
Council meeting in Washington. <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> said that he would need 
$400.00 for travel to attend the upcoming Council meeting in New 
York and added "I won't do that unless all 63O dollars are here 
beforehand." <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent> promptly sent <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> a check for $350 as a 
travel advance and assured him he would be reimbursed for 
previous travel expense as soon as he submitted an expense 
account--which <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> had never done (In "sTARBABY," <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> 
characterizes this as a "ridiculous excuse" for failure to 
reimburse him earlier.) <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> cashed the $350 check but did not 
attend the New York Council meeting, nor did he inform the 
Council that he would not attend. <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> never refunded the $120 
difference between $230 he claimed was due him and the $350 he 
received. Yet <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> professes to have been shocked and 
surprised when the Council voted unanimously not to reelect 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> at its New York meeting. (Since <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> seems so easily 
shocked and surprised, I suspect he was equally surprised at the 
resignation of <ent type='person'>Richard</ent> M. <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>.) </p>

<p> Two months later, <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> wrote to <ent type='person'>Frazier</ent> saying he wished 
to resign from the Editorial Board. But he insisted that the 
resignation should not take effect until his statement 
complaining about not being reelected "in absentia" was 
published. This <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> statement claimed that he had not been 
reelected solely because he had criticized "CSICOP's conduct 
during ITS FOUR YEAR INVOLVEMENT in testing <ent type='person'>Gauquelin</ent>'s neo- 
astrology..." (Emphasis added.) </p>

<p> Had <ent type='person'>Frazier</ent> opted to publish this grossly inaccurate 
statement, which he did not, readers might well have wondered if 
there were really two different <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Dennis</ent> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent></ent>, recalling barely 
a year earlier when a <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> letter had been published which 
said: "It should be clearly understood that CSICOP as a body 
never had anything to do with the Humanist <ent type='person'>Zelen</ent> test 
'challenge'..." When <ent type='person'>Frazier</ent> accepted <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' resignation, this 
prompted <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> to complain that he had been removed from the 
Editorial Board without "cause or written notice." Later, 
following a mail ballot of Council members, CSICOP dropped 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> from its list of Fellows. (The vote against <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> was 
6:1.) </p>

<p> The foregoing highlights the key issues and actions that 
prompted FATE and <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> to charge that CSICOP "bungled their 
major investigation, falsified the results, covered up their 
errors and gave the boot to a colleague who threatened to tell 
the truth." (After my investigation, a re-reading of "sTARBABY" 
gives me the feeling that I am reading a Pravda account 
explaining that the Soviets moved into Afghanistan to help the 
Afghans prevent an invasion by the U.S. Central Intelligence 
Agency.) </p>

<p> Were it possible to turn back the clock, undoubtedly <ent type='person'>Kurtz</ent>, 
<ent type='person'>Zelen</ent> and <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Abel</ent>l</ent> would try to be more precise in defining test 
objectives and protocol and would do so in writing. And more time 
would be spent in more carefully phrasing articles dealing with 
such tests. But all CSICOP Council members and Fellows have other 
full-time professions that seriously constrain time available for 
CSICOP efforts. </p>

<p>Were it possible to turn back the clock, the Council should have 
insisted in the spring of 1978 that <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> issue a public 
statement that he had erred in using CSICOP's name in support of 
his personal actions connected with the University of Toronto's 
planned astrology symposium. Failure to do this has resulted in 
an unjustified blot on CSICOP's modus-operandi. Also at that time 
the Council should have developed a policy statement, as it 
recently did, that more clearly delineates activities that 
members perform officially in behalf of CSICOP and those carried 
out as private individuals. </p>

<p> When a small group of persons met in Buffalo in May, 1976, 
to create CSICOP, their motivation was a concern over the growing 
public acceptance of claims of the paranormal. CSICOP was created 
to provide a counter-balance to those who espouse a variety of 
claims, ranging from UFOs to astrology, from the "Bermuda 
Triangle" to psychic phenomena. With the benefit of experience, 
it was apparent that there was an extreme spectrum of viewpoints 
on the Council. <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> was at the "hit-'em-hard" extreme, while 
<ent type='person'>Truzzi</ent> was at the opposite pole and resigned after a couple 
years, partially as a result of behind-the scenes plotting by 
<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> which he admits in "sTARBABY." Now <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> has departed 
and, in my view, CSICOP is much the better for it. </p>

<p> CSICOP never has tried to destroy those organizations that 
promote belief in paranormal causes. But individuals in these 
organization have tried to discredit CSICOP, even going so far in 
one instance as to circulate a forged letter. </p>

<p> FATE magazine made wide distribution of the <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> 
"sTARBABY" article in reprint form, together with its press 
release. Prof. R.A. <ent type='person'>McConnell</ent>, University of Pittsburgh, founding 
President of the Parapsychological Association, also distributed 
copies to CSICOP Fellows and Council members, among others. In 
his accompanying letter, <ent type='person'>McConnell</ent> said he believed the "<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> 
report is certainly true in broad outline and probably true in 
every detail...He has created a document of importance for the 
history and philosophy of science." <ent type='person'>McConnell</ent> quoted an "unnamed 
scientist" as claiming that "<ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> has uncovered the biggest 
scandal in the history of rationalism." <ent type='person'>McConnell</ent> characterized 
CSICOP as "an intellectually dishonest enterprise." </p>

<p> FATE and <ent type='person'>McConnell</ent> have demonstrated the intrinsic flaw in 
the basic approach of those who promote claims of the paranormal 
-- THEIR EAGERNESS TO ACCEPT CLAIMS OF EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS 
WITHOUT RIGOROUS INVESTIGATION. Neither FATE nor <ent type='person'>McConnell</ent> 
contacted CSICOP officials to check out <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' charges. This 
demonstrates why CSICOP is so sorely needed. </p>

<p> The late President <ent type='person'>Harry Truman</ent> phrased it well: "If you 
can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen." CSICOP is "in the 
kitchen" by choice and intends to remain there despite the heat. 
The response of CSICOP's Council and its Fellows to recent events 
shows that the Committee is not an easy victim of heat- 
prostration. </p>

<p> If the Mars effect, or any other paranormal hypothesis, 
should ever be demonstrated using rigorous scientific procedures, 
there simply is no way in which the small group of individuals 
involved in CSICOP could ever hope to suppress such evidence. Nor 
have I found any CSICOP Council member or Fellow who is so 
foolish as to try. </p>

<p> [In the years following "sTARBABY", <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> has continued to 
 receive publicity by making sensational charges of 
 scientific coverup and fraud. In 1988 he made national 
 headlines by renewing an earlier charge he had made before 
 CSICOP's founding, this time supposedly supported by a new- 
 found document: that Admiral <ent type='person'>Peary</ent> never actually reached 
 the North Pole during his famous expedition in 1909, but 
 instead fabricated his navigational records to make it 
 appear as if he had. A New York Times article of October 13, 
 1988 carries the headline: "<ent type='person'>Peary</ent>'s Notes <ent type='person'>Said</ent> to Imply He 
 Fell Short of Pole." It begins: "New evidence based on 
 navigational notes by <ent type='person'>Robert</ent> E. <ent type='person'>Peary</ent> indicates that the 
 Arctic explorer fell short of his goal and deliberately 
 faked his claim in 1909 that he was the first person to 
 reach the North Pole, according to an analysis by a 
 Baltimore astronomer and historian ... <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Dennis</ent> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent></ent>, an 
 independent scholar who trained as an astronomer and who has 
 a long-standing interest in <ent type='person'>Peary</ent>'s expedition, said 
 yesterday that his analysis of the navigational notes, 
 mainly sextant readings of the sun to establish geographic 
 position, indicated that <ent type='person'>Peary</ent> knew that he had come no 
 closer than 121 miles from the Pole." Officials of the 
 National Geographic Society promised to examine <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' 
 data, but added "We believe Mr. <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> has been too quick 
 to cry fake." </p>

<p> After a three-month investigation of <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' charges, a 
 press conference was sponsored by The Navigation Foundation 
 at which they dismissed his "sensational claims". As 
 reported in a Baltimore Sun story syndicated Feb. 2, 1989, 
 "Since October [Natl. Geographic] Society President <ent type='person'>Gilbert</ent> 
 M. Grosvenor and others had quietly endured <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent>' public 
 calls for debate and unconditional surrender on the <ent type='person'>Peary</ent> 
 issue." The Society was willing to take seriously an 
 analysis by the British explorer <ent type='person'>Wally Herbert</ent>, based on 
 other evidence, that a navigation error may have caused 
 <ent type='person'>Peary</ent> to miss the pole by about 45 miles. "Suggesting that 
 <ent type='person'>Peary</ent> might not have reached the Pole is one thing," said 
 Grosvenor. "Declaring <ent type='person'>Peary</ent> a fraud is quite another." 
 <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> held his own "informal press conference" afterwards, 
 reports The Sun, in which <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> "admitted he had confused 
 time readings for chronometer checks with altitudes of the 
 sun and had mistaken serial numbers on the chronometers for 
 navigational observations." <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent> conceded, "My 
 interpretation has some problems, and I acknowledge that. 
 It's fair to say that, if I'm saying <ent type='person'>Peary</ent> was a fraud, I 
 think I have not yet met the burden of proof." </p>

<p> Finally, in December, 1989, a 230-page report commissioned 
 by the National Geographic Society was released, concluding 
 that <ent type='person'>Peary</ent> actually did reach the Pole. As reported in a 
 story on p.1 of the New York Times, Dec. 12, 1989, a new 
 analysis of <ent type='person'>Peary</ent>'s records by professional navigators 
 concluded that <ent type='person'>Peary</ent>'s final camp was not more than five 
 miles from the Pole. "The report said, there was no evidence 
 of fraud and deception in the explorer's records. But one 
 critic, <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Dennis</ent> <ent type='person'>Rawlins</ent></ent>, a Baltimore astronomer and 
 historian, said he remained convinced, despite the new 
 study, that Admiral <ent type='person'>Peary</ent> did not reach his goal and had 
 faked his claim." </p>
