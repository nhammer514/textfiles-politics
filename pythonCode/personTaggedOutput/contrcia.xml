<xml><p>SECRET TEAM OF WEAPONS DEALERS
by <ent type='person'>Vince</ent> Bielski</p>

<p>   A "secret team" of former CIA and military officials and
arms dealers are responsible for the covert weapons shipments to
Iran and the contras under the direction of fired White House
aide Lt. Col. <ent type='person'>Oliver North</ent>.</p>

<p>   Members of the "secret team" came together in the secret war
against Cuba in 1961, and have since been involved in "political
assassination" programs in Laos, Vietnam, Chile and now
Nicaragua.</p>

<p>   The "secret team," through an association with known Mafia
leaders, has resorted to opium and cocaine trafficking to
finance their operations.</p>

<p>   <ent type='person'>Edwin Wilson</ent>, the ex-CIA operative convicted for selling
explosives to Libya's <ent type='person'>Moammar Gadhafi</ent>, was an active member.</p>

<p>   These allegations are part of a lengthy affidavit filed this
week in a Miami federal court  in support of a law suit brought
by <ent type='person'>Dan Sheehan</ent>, an attorney with the Christic Institute in
Washington. The suit names 29 alledged operatives in the contras
arms network as defendants.</p>

<p>   The suit alleges that the defendants supplied the C-4
explosives which were used in the May 1984 assassination attempt
against contra leader <ent type='person'>Eden Pastora</ent> in Nicaragua in which eight
people were killed and <ent type='person'>Pastora</ent> injured. The plaintiffs, Martha
Honey and <ent type='person'>Tony Avirgan</ent>, are American journalists who are sueing
for personal injuries they suffered from the bombing.</p>

<p>   The Christic Institute, a church funded public interest law
firm, has taken on controversial cases in the past, such as the
suit against Kerr McGree Nuclear Corporation on behalf of Karen
Silkwood. And it was while <ent type='person'>Sheehan</ent> was defending a sanctuary
worker that he received information which led him
into the investigation of the contra arms supply opertation.</p>

<p>   In March 1984, he learned from a member of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency that FEMA had a highly secret plan to
"deputize" government and State National Guard personnel for the
purpose of interning 400000 undocumented Central
Americans in detention centers in the event that President <ent type='person'>Reagan</ent>
launched "Operation Night-train"--a military invasion into
Central America.</p>

<p>   The plan also called for the distribution from U.S. military
bases of hundreds of tons of weapons to be used by newly created
State Defense Forces, composed of civilians, who would help
enforce the "State of Domestic National Emergency" during the
invasion.  <ent type='person'>Sheehan</ent> learned from a Louisiana State National Guard
Colonel that a State Defense Force in Louisiana planned to give
half of the weapons it received to the contras.</p>

<p>   In Miami, former U.S. military personnel and active National
Guard units had organized a para-military organization, called
Civilian Military Assistance, to arm, train and fight with the
contras. The group, headed by <ent type='person'>Tom Posey</ent>, obtained "surplus"
military equipment from the 20th Special Forces Unit of the U.S.
Army in Alabama, <ent type='person'>Sheehan</ent> learned from a member of the group.</p>

<p>   In June 1984, <ent type='person'>Sheehan</ent> was informed a man who
working with the para-military organization in helping arm the
contras also claimed to be a "personal representative to the
Contras of...Lt. Col. <ent type='person'>Oliver North</ent>." His name is <ent type='person'>Robert Owen</ent>.</p>

<p>   One year later, <ent type='person'>Sheehan</ent> began putting this information into
a law suit when he learned that <ent type='person'>Posey</ent>, Owen and others
were allegedly involved in the bombing of the <ent type='person'>Pastora</ent> press
conference which caused physical and personal injury to the two
American reporters.</p>

<p>   <ent type='person'>Sheehan</ent>s investigation also led him to the discovery of a
"secret team" of former high ranking U.S. officials and officers
who oversaw the procurement and shipment of weapons to the
contras to to Iran. Through <ent type='person'>Posey</ent>, Owen and other they allegedly
supplied the explosives for the press conference bombing.  The
"secret team" includes former high-ranking CIA officials Theodore
Shackley and <ent type='person'>Thomas Clines</ent>, ret. Air Force Gen. <ent type='person'>Richard Secord</ent>,
ex-CIA operative <ent type='person'>Edwin Wilson</ent>, and two arms dealers, <ent type='person'>Albert Hakim</ent>
(of Los Gatos) and <ent type='person'>Rafael Quintero</ent>, both of whom are U.S.
citizens.</p>

<p>   In the affidavit, which cites 79 seperate sources, <ent type='person'>Sheehan</ent>
said he learned of the "secret team" from a former U.S.
intelligence officer who worked in Iran, a retired CIA officer,
and a former Air Force officer.</p>

<p>   The intelligence officer discussed "the existence of a
'secret team' of former high-ranking American CIA officials,
former high-ranking U.S. military officials and Middle Eastern
arms merchants--who also specialized in the performance of covert
political assassinations of communists...(and) which carried on
its own, independent, American foreign policy--regardless of the
will of Congress,...the President,...or the (CIA)," the affidavit
reads.</p>

<p>   The source said the "secret team" was set up in
1977 under the supervision of Shackley and <ent type='person'>Cline</ent>, who were then
with the CIA.  <ent type='person'>Wilson</ent> worked with <ent type='person'>Gadhafi</ent> "to secretly train
Libyan anti-Shah of Iran terrorists in the use of deadly C-4
explosives," the affidavit reads. <ent type='person'>Wilson</ent>'s real purpose was to
gather intelligence on the anti-Shah terrorist missions, and then
pass the information to <ent type='person'>Quintero</ent>, "who was responsible for the
assassination of these Libyan terrorists,"</p>

<p>   <ent type='person'>Wilson</ent> was convicted for his dealings with <ent type='person'>Gadhafi</ent>, and
Shackley and <ent type='person'>Cline</ent>s resigned under pressure from then-CIA
director <ent type='person'>Stansfield Turner</ent>.  Shackley and <ent type='person'>Cline</ent>s then join with
<ent type='person'>Secord</ent> and <ent type='person'>Hakim</ent> and "went private" continuing to run their
"secret team," the affidavit reads.</p>

<p>   This group--initially through the Egyptian-American
Transport and Service Company--was "responsible for the entire
supply of weapons...to the Contras," when the CIA wasn't directly
providing them. They began arming the contras in August 1979,
after entering "into a formal contractual agreement with
Nicaraguan dictator <ent type='person'>Anastasio Somoza</ent>" despite President <ent type='person'>Carter</ent>'s
order banning the sending of weapons to <ent type='person'>Somoza</ent>, the affidavit
reads.</p>

<p>   The CIA took over in 1981, but when the 1984 ban on U.S.
support went into effect, North reactivated the private
merchants. <ent type='person'>Quintero</ent>, operating through a Florida based
corporation named Orca Supply Company--a company earlier set up
by <ent type='person'>Edwin Wilson</ent>--saw to it that the supplies were delivered to
the contras through <ent type='person'>John Hull</ent>, a U.S. citizen, who reportedly
operates a contra base in northern Costa Rica on land he owns.
Among the delivered weapons were the explosives used in the
Pastor bombing, the CIA source said.</p>

<p>   To fund the contras, the "secret team" resorted to the
foreign military sales scheme used in Iran in which military
equipment is bought from the U.S. government at the
manufacturer's cost and sold to Iran at replacement cost. The
profits are then laundered through front companies.</p>

<p>  The Examiner reported in July that <ent type='person'>Secord</ent>, partners with
<ent type='person'>Hakim</ent> in Standford Technology Trading Group International, was
involved in the 1981 sale of AWACS to Saudi Arabia, in which
money from that sale financed the contra operation.</p>

<p>   In another report, the Examiner said the weapons were also
financed by an elaborate cocaine ring involing Columbia's largest
cocaine dealers in which the drug moves from Columbia,
through Hull's land, into the U.S at a level of one ton each
week.</p>

<p>   When the <ent type='person'>Reagan</ent> Administration decided to undertake the
secret sales of arms to Iran in 1985, it was Shackley, <ent type='person'>Cline</ent>s,
<ent type='person'>Hakim</ent> and <ent type='person'>Secord</ent> whom they used to carry out the mission, the
affidavit reads.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND</p>

<p>   In 1961, Shackley, a CIA station chief in Miami, and his
deputy <ent type='person'>Cline</ent>s, directed the covert war against Cuba.  A special
unit formed to assassinate <ent type='person'>Castro</ent>, supervised by the "Mafia
Lieutenant Santo Trafficante," included <ent type='person'>Quintero</ent>--and Felix
Rodreguez and <ent type='person'>Luis Pasada Carillo</ent>--two ex-CIA agent who
reportedly operate the contras arms network at an El Salvador air
base. Pasada was involved in the 1976 mid-air bombing
of a Cuban passenger airliner.</p>

<p>   After the covert war activists were caught smuggling narcotics
into the U.S. from Cuba, the operation was shut down, and Shackley
and <ent type='person'>Cline</ent>s were transfered to Laos, where Shackley was made CIA
Deputy Chief of Station and <ent type='person'>Cline</ent>s continued as his deputy.</p>

<p>   According to the affidavit, Shackley and <ent type='person'>Cline</ent>s directed a
secret program which trained and used <ent type='person'>Meo</ent> tribesmen "to
secretly assassinated over 100000 non-combatant village mayors,
book-keepers, clerks and other civilian bureaucrats in Laos,
Cambodia and Thailand." The operation was funded by profits from
an illegal opium trade.</p>

<p>   A commander the political assassination program was ret.
Army General <ent type='person'>John Singlaub</ent>, who has said publicly that he is
helping arm the contras. North, a Marine Corps Major at the time,
was one of <ent type='person'>Singlaub</ent>'s deputies. Also involved with Shackley in
Laos was <ent type='person'>Secord</ent>, then an Air Force General, the affidavit
reads.</p>

<p>   In 1971,  Shackley and <ent type='person'>Cline</ent>s, from their post the CIA's
Western Hemisphere operations, directed the "Track II" operation
in Chile which played a role in the assassination of Chilean
President <ent type='person'>Salvador Allende</ent>, the affidavit reads.</p>

<p>   In 1974, the two directed the Phoenix project in Vietnam,
which carried out the political assassination of some 60000 non-
Viet Cong civilians in an attempt to cripple Vietnam's political
institutions.</p>
