<p>  the reason for the assassination was to control the power of the presidency.</p>

<div>   ----------------------------</div>

<p> The following appeared in the October, 1975 issue of "Gallery," a porno
 magazine which billed <ent type='person'>Fletcher Prouty</ent> as the "National Affairs Editor."
 Some people feel there is no credible way to justify associating oneself
 with such exploitative and demeaning media.  <ent type='person'>Fletcher Prouty</ent> has told me
 that since the <ent type='person'>Ballentine</ent> paperback edition of "The Secret Team" was
 "disappeared" soon after it came out in February of 1974, it was very
 difficult for him to find publishers who would print his writings (from
 9/74 to 7/75 he was able to get 7 articles published in "Genesis" (another
 porno magazine), and from 9/75 to 6/78 he got 14 articles printed in
 "Gallery)".  Up until the <ent type='person'>Ballentine</ent> paperback was squelched, he had been
 published in the likes of "The Nation," "The New Republic," (including
 cover-story features), and "Air Force Magazine."  It is a telling
 indictment of the reality of the lack of public access to the mainstream
 corporate press, that a man like <ent type='person'>Fletcher Prouty</ent>--who served in the Air
 Force for 23 years, rose to the rank of Colonel, was a briefing officer in
 the Pentagon from 1955 thru 12/31/63, serving also as Focal Point Officer
 (<ent type='person'>liason</ent>) between the DOD and the CIA, first in the Headquarters of the Air
 Force (1955 to 1960), where he set up and then ran the structures that
 supplied Air Force logistical (military hardware) support for CIA
 clandestine operations world-wide, then in the Office of the Secretary of
 Defense (1960 into 1961), and then in the Office of the Joint Chiefs of
 Staff (1961 thru 12/31/63) where he ran the same support for all branches
 of the military--that a man possessing such critical first-hand experience
 and knowledge of the mechanisms, methodogy and factual history of CIA
 covert operations in this seminal period, would find his writings and
 analysis of these important issues essentially barred from the most
 generally accessible publications.  As long as the conglomerate press in
 this country continues to increasingly restrict the range and variety of
 points of view being published, writers will resort to certain types of
 publishers they would not choose to go to if they had a better alternative.</p>

  Reprinted here this one time only with permission by of the author</p>

<p>  The shocking nature of what you are about to read in this article
  makes it imperative that you be aware of some of the credentials
  and experience of the author.
  From 1955 to December 31, 1963, Col. L. <ent type='person'>Fletcher Prouty</ent> was the
  Focal Point (<ent type='person'>liason</ent>) officer between the Pentagon and the CIA.
  During 1962 and 1963 he was Director of Special Plans (clandestine
  operations) in the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
  In 1971 he was the president of the Financial Marketing Council,
  Washington, D.C.
  He is the author of numerous articles and of "The Secret Team,"
  published by Prentice Hall (1973) and Ballantine Books (1974).

<p> This article included a great deal of photograhic evidence of the events 
 in Dealey Plaza.  The photographic research was by <ent type='person'>Richard</ent> E. Sprague.
 Unfortunately, I will only be able to include the text in this post.

<p>   ________________________________________________</p>

<p>   How was the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission kept 
   from investigating and seeing evidence?  
   This is the real issue.  
    This is a crime to top the crime.
   ________________________________________________</p>

<p>  As we prepare now to celebrate the beginning of the third century
  of the founding of this country, we wonder if we live in the land
  of the free.  We wonder if at least we still have a government of
  the people and by the people.  Certainly, it is no longer a
  government for the people.  The sound throughout the land is ugly:
  there is frustration, hate, and fear.  We must act while there may
  still be time.
   There is a grave conspiracy over the land.  The people have come
  alive because of Vietnam and Watergate;  but they have scarcely
  scratched the surface.  A President and a Vice-President have been
  forced to resign.  A President has been shot to death.  Two
  Presidential candidates have been shot, one of them killed.  Many
  of the President's men have been forced to leave, some have gone to
  jail;  others are still under indictment.
   Yes, history has been made by a series of murders, but not
  enough has been done to solve them.  The trial of Watergate was the
  trial of the cover-up.  There has been no trial about the real
  crime of Watergate.  There has been no trial of the big power 
  behind Watergate.  The Hunts, Liddys, McCords, and the Cubans were 
  not drawn into that drama solely for their own interests.  They 
  were working for someone much higher up.  They were all pawns, just 
  like <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent> was.  This is a game for the biggest stake of all--
  absolute control of the government of the United States of America;  
  and, with control of this government, control of the world.  And 
  yet the real crime underlying all of this has not even been 
  identified, stated, and charged.  The real criminals still walk the 
  streets, run their corporations, control their banks, and pull 
  strings throughout their political and financial machines.</p>

<p>   This control mechanism did not start in 1972 with Watergate.  It
  began, in a tentative way, in the Korean War era, when the military
  and the executive branch found out how easy it was to fool the
  Congress and the American public.  And with that recognition,
  power-hungry and money-mad industrialists began to usurp more and
  more power.  And when those rifles crackled over Dealey Plaza, in
  Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963 and John F. <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent>'s brain was
  splattered across the road, they had made their move into the big
  time.  They took over control of the President and of the
  Presidency.  The man they had killed was no longer a problem and
  they had made certain that his successor, <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Lyndon</ent> <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent></ent>, heard and
  remembered the sound of those guns.  It is the sound of those guns
  in Dallas, and their ever-present threat, which is the real
  mechanism of control over the American government.
   It is possible now to reconstruct the scenario of that day, and,
  with new information, to show why the murder of <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> may properly be
  called the "Crime of the Century."  If we the people of the United
  States do not demand its resolution this year, it will stand in the
  way of a free election in 1976.  It will doom a third century of
  democratic government in this country.
   Almost everyone who has taken the time to do any reading and
  thinking about that crime knows by now that John <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> was killed
  not by a lone assassin, but by a group of hired "mechanics."  Let's
  look at some of the hard facts of this murder and put to rest once
  and for all the "cover-up" report of the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission.
   The <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission categorically stated that <ent type='person'>Lee Harvey</ent>
  <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> was the killer of <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> and that he acted alone.  The <ent type='person'>Warren</ent>
  Commission says that <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> fired three shots, only three shots,
  from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building
  and that his lair was at a window, number one from the right
  (eastern-most on the south side) on that sixth floor.  (See photo
  1. [NUMBER 1.  The Texas School Book Depository Building.  Arrow
  points to window from which <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> supposedly shot <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent>. (photo
  by <ent type='person'>Willis</ent>.)])</p>

<p>   If one breaks this contrived <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission story, then the
  fundament of the "lone assassin" theory is undermined.  Break this
  weak theory and you are confronted immediately with an awareness of
  the existence of a massive conspiracy.  And we are equally
  convinced that this group hired at least four expert "mechanics"
  (assassins).  This group wielded control over elements of the
  Dallas police, the <ent type='person'>Sheriff</ent>'s office, the FBI, the Secret Service,
  and the CIA.  This great cabal had control high enough in
  government, or at least in the councils of government, to be able
  to influence the travel plans of the President, the Vice-President
  and a Presidential candidate (<ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>), and all members of the
  <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> cabinet.  They were powerful enough to have orders issued
  to the Army, and they were able to mount a massive campaign to
  control the media during and after the assassination.  They were
  able to have <ent type='person'>Jack Ruby</ent> kill <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> and to transfer jurisdiction of
  the murder from Texas and then to effectively control the outcome
  of the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission review.
   Then as soon as <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> was dead, they began an even larger campaign
  to cover up that crime forever.  <ent type='person'>Penn Jones</ent>, the tenacious editor
  of the Midlothian, Texas, "Mirror," has devoted his life to
  "researching the hell" out of this conspiracy.  He has a list of
  some eighty-five people who, because they knew too much or got too
  close, have died sudden and unnatural deaths since the <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> murder.
   This great cabal had seen to it that Vice-President <ent type='person'>Lyndon</ent>
  <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> was in the <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> procession, and they saw to it that he
  heard those hired guns, that he saw <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> die, and that he lived
  through that terrible nightmare of the trip back to Washington on
  Air Force One.  From that day on, LBJ never again was that self-
  confident, swash-buckling, free-wheeling Texan.  Before he died,
  LBJ told his old friend <ent type='person'>Tom Janos</ent> that he knew <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> had not
  killed <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> alone.
   The American public is now ready enough to have the cloak torn
  from the lies about the <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> murder and the cover-up;  but the
  American public has not had the guts to face the fact of the
  massive conspiracy that arranged for that murder and which to this
  day perpetuates its cover-up.</p>

<p>   Many of us have been convinced, as a result of careful and
  detailed study that the first of these glass barricades, the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent>
  Commission report, is a lie.  And, we are equally convinced that
  the cover-up of the murder can be smashed and the conspiracy
  exposed.  But if we don't act now, there will be consequences.
  These will begin with either the cancellation of elections in 1976
  or with elections that will be a total sham.  For who will dare run
  against the candidate of the conspiracy?  Will it be <ent type='person'>Wallace</ent> with
  his wounds and from his wheelchair, or another <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent>, or Ed
  Muskie, who was badly roughed up in 1972, or George McGovern, who
  was twice scheduled for assassination in 1972?
   Who, unless he sells his soul to the cabal, can face those hired
  guns?
   Today, our country is being run by a President and a Vice-
  President who have not been elected to office.  This is merely a
  process to condition the American public.
   Let's begin here by breaking apart the whole fabric of the
  lone-killer thesis.  On November 28, 1963, less than one week after
  <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent>'s death, the Secret Service, the agency closest to the
  scene, reported that three shots were fired.  The Secret Service
  said that the first hit the President, the second hit Governor John
  <ent type='person'>Connally</ent> of Texas, and the third struck the President.  There were
  no other shots according to the Secret Service.  *The Secret
  Service was wrong*!
   On December 9, 1963, the FBI reported that three shots had been
  fired and that two hit the President and that one hit John
  <ent type='person'>Connally</ent>.  The FBI says there were no other shots.  The FBI was
  less specific than the Secret Service.  *The FBI was wrong*.
   Then, much later, on September 27, 1964 (ten months after the
  crime), the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission issued its report along with twenty-
  six huge volumes of random data.  This report states that there
  were three shots.  *The <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission was wrong*.</p>

<p>   According to the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission, the first shot, the "miracle
  bullet" designed and dreamed up by one of its lawyers (Arlen
  <ent type='person'>Specter</ent>), is one of the most fascinating contrivances of our
  generation.  Forced to account for a series of unrelated events,
  <ent type='person'>Arlen Specter</ent> came up with a weird solution.  He says the first
  bullet hit <ent type='person'>JFK</ent>, passed through the muscle of his upper back exited
  from his lower throat, traveled a few feet in the air, changed
  course, and entered <ent type='person'>Connally</ent>'s back, plunged through his body,
  broke about five inches of one of his right rib bones, came out
  again, and then slammed into his right wrist, where it broke two
  more bones, exited again, and then pierced his thigh and ended its
  strange journey embedded in his thigh bone.
   An interpretation of this thesis, based on photographic and
  medical evidence, means the bullet would have had to have made a
  right and upward turn upon leaving <ent type='person'>JFK</ent>'s throat, paused in midair
  for more than two seconds, made a left and steep downward turn as
  it entered <ent type='person'>Connally</ent>'s back, made a right and upward turn as it left
  <ent type='person'>Connally</ent>'s chest, passed through <ent type='person'>Connally</ent>'s wrist in the direction
  backward from the way his wrist was facing, made another left and
  downward turn, then wound up in <ent type='person'>Connally</ent>'s left thigh.
   Right here we see the brazen, "To Hell with the Public"
  character of the Commission report.  Can you imagine some lawyer,
  even the persuasive and imaginative <ent type='person'>Specter</ent>, selling that bullet
  and its bumble-bee flight to any jury of intelligent Americans?
  The Commission was stuck with a "three bullet" crime because the
  Secret Service and the FBI had both reported three bullets, because
  there were only 6.8 seconds of shooting[1], as proven precisely by
  a film of the event made by <ent type='person'>Abraham Zapruder</ent>, and because the
  character who planted the shells at the "<ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> lair" had only put
  three there.  Furthermore, if they were going to stick with the
  "lone assassin" solution, they were faced with the hard task of
  making it appear feasible that <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> alone could have gotten off
  just three bullets in 6.8 seconds, let alone four, five, or six.
   The Zapruder movie film, which shows the entire scene from
  beginning to end, became invaluable as a master clock of the whole
  affair.  It established a foolproof chronology of the crime.  It is
  not too difficult to determine precisely when (what frame of the
  movie film) the first shot was fired;  and it is equally simple to
  determine exactly the elapsed time until the last shot was fired.
  So, unless the Commission could accept that there might have been
  other gunmen who fired during the same 6.8 seconds--and this the
  Commission categorically denied--it was going to have to show that
  <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> could have fired three bullets from that sixth-floor window,
  and that he performed this feat in super-marksmanship time of 6.8
  seconds.  It is significant to stress here that the supposed murder
  weapon was a cheap Italian Mannlicher-Carcano mail-order rifle, a
  single-shot, bolt-action antique.
   Another complication crept into the Commission's connivance.
  One of the bystanders at Dealey Plaza that day was a man named
  <ent type='person'>James Tague</ent>.  He was hit by a fragment of concrete knocked off the
  curb by a bullet that had hit a curbstone near where he stood.
  (See photo 2. [NUMBER 2.*  <ent type='person'>James Tague</ent>, on the far right, with cut
  on face after he was hit by a fragment of concrete that was knocked
  off the curb by errant bullet. (photo by <ent type='person'>Allen</ent>.)] )  He reported 
  his injury to a hospital.  So there was another man on record as 
  having been hit during these same 6.8 seconds.  This forced the 
  Commission to accept that one bullet, the second by their count, 
  missed both <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> and <ent type='person'>Connally</ent>.  This complicated their task.  
  Remember, neither the Secret Service nor the FBI has accounted for 
  that "missed" bullet and there were only three shell cases and no 
  clips at <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent>'s window.  They both had said that three shots were
  fired and that two hit <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> and one hit <ent type='person'>Connally</ent>.  The FBI later 
  found the nick in the curbstone, took a section of it back to their 
  labs in Washington, analyzed it, and decided that a bullet had 
  indeed hit the curb.
   The Zapruder film makes it abundantly clear that the top of the
  President's head was blown off and the skull and brain spattered as
  far as thirty-seven yards away by a third shot.  Thus the
  Commission gives the "official" version:  three shots.  The third
  shot, the missed second shot, and none other than the contrived
  "<ent type='person'>Specter</ent> Miracle Bullet"--the first shot.  (See photos 345.
  [NUMBER 3. Z-313, showing impact and explosion of third shot, which
  killed <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent>.  NUMBER 4. "The Miracle bullet."  Commission 
  exhibit 399:  a portion was sliced from for FBI spectrographic 
  comparison with other bullet fragments.  The results were never
  released.  NUMBER 5.* X-ray of fragment of the "miracle bullet"
  still in <ent type='person'>John Connally</ent>'s thigh.  This fragment is larger than any
  piece missing from the "miracle bullet."])
   As if this were not fantasy enough, and as if this were not
  carrying their "To Hell with the Public" role far enough, the
  Commission reports that this same miracle bullet was found forty-
  five minutes later in the Parkland Hospital more than three hectic
  miles from the scene of the murder.  It was on a stretcher which
  "somebody" presumed <ent type='person'>Connally</ent> had been lying on.
   This is the stuff of the Commission solution and this is what we
  have been asked and forced to believe for the past eleven years.
  Any ballistics expert worth his gunpowder would shrink from the
  task of developing the theory of that bullet.  Pictures of that
  undamaged bullet show it as clean as a brand-new slug.  It looks as
  though it had hardly been fired at all, let alone having traveled
  through two men, broken three bones, and lodged in a fourth. [3]</p>

<p>   ____________________________________________________________________
   |    How the Zapruder Film Created a Time Clock   |
   |  for the Assassination in Dealey Plaza    |
   |       |
   |   <ent type='person'>Abraham Zapruder</ent>'s camera was running at a determinable |
   |   speed:  18.3 frames per second.  The camera had a   |
   |   governor control, so its speed was constant.  Each frame  |
   |   of the film was 1/18th of a second apart.  Since John   |
   |   <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> appeared in every frame of the relevant sequence  |
   |   of the film, the FBI was able to plot on a surveyor's map   |
   |   of Dealey Plaza, <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent>'s exact position at each frame |
   |   number.  This "map" perfectly coordinated two functions:  |
   |   time and place--where <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> was at each moment, within  |
   |   1/18th of a second accuracy, and a distance error of no |
   |   more than 7.3 inches.  The Zapruder film was used to  |
   |   determine the speed of the President's car, the elapsed |
   |   time between events, especially between the first and last  |
   |   shots (6.8 seconds), and the timing of events in the  |
   |   background.    --<ent type='person'>Richard</ent> E. Sprague |
   |       |
   |   Z denotes Zapruder film and frame number.   |
   |___________________________________________________________________|</p>

<p>   I have worked with the CIA and military officials in testing
  special rifles.  I have seen countless bullets fired into gelatin
  and paraffin to simulate body hits on humans.  I have seen goats
  shot under controlled conditions to show what impact will do.  In
  my own experience, admittedly limited, I have never seen an
  undamaged slug, no matter what substance it had been fired into,
  except when fired carefully into cotton.[4]  But even then there
  are scars, lines, and even deformity.  The "<ent type='person'>Specter</ent> Miracle Bullet"
  does not even show that much damage.
   There is no point in dwelling on this in more detail here except
  for the most important fact that, if any of the major Commission
  conclusions are shattered, then the whole house of cards comes down
  and the whole Commission solution is exploded.  And because this
  solution is wrong, then <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent></ent> was not the lone
  assassin, and because he was not the lone assassin, there was a
  conspiracy.
   This incredulous miracle bullet, then, is the key to opening the
  whole can of worms.  Let's look at bullet Number Two, the one which
  hit a curb and injured bystander <ent type='person'>James Tague</ent>.  The Secret Service
  and the FBI ignored it and the Commission passed over it lightly.
  Now, if you were told that the assassin missed the President and
  that the bullet hit a curb;  and if you were told that the assassin
  fired from high above from the sixth floor, you would not have been
  wrong to have concluded that this errant bullet hit the curb on the
  far side of the street beside the President's car.  *Wrong*!
   This bullet hit the curb on the far side of the next street and
  more than twice as far away as the car was from the sixth-floor
  window.  The President's car was traveling down Elm Street, and
  Tague was standing on Main Street.  If that bullet was fired by
  <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> in the first window, then he missed <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> by twenty-one feet
  on the right and thirty-three feet overhead and the shot went 260
  feet rather than ninety feet.  This is a fantastic and unbelievable
  miss for a man who was supposedly able to fire the "<ent type='person'>Specter</ent> Miracle
  Bullet" on his first try and then to knock the entire right side of
  the President's head off with his third shot after pumping two
  bullets into that ancient single-shot rifle in 6.8 seconds!
   It is much more plausible to believe that this missed shot was
  fired from a point much lower down and on a line with the nick on
  the curbstone and the President's head.  In other words, a near
  miss.  This would have placed the gunman's lair somewhere in the
  adjacent Dal Tex Building, perhaps under the second-floor fire
  escape.  This establishes a second lair, a second gun, and a second
  "mechanic."  (See photo 6. [NUMBER 6. (Commission's Shaneyfelt
  Exhibit.)  <ent type='person'>Lyndal Shaneyfelt</ent>, the FBI's ballistics and photographic
  expert, took this picture from the spot where the shot that missed
  hit the curb.  By sighting back to the sixth floor window, the 
  degree of miss can be seen.  By sighting directly over <ent type='person'>JFK</ent>'s 
  position, the top of the white car in the center lane, anyone can
  see where the shot came from:  the second floor window of the Dal
  Tex building.  See Altgen's photo, number 8.])
   It is not hard to find another shot that <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> could not have
  made.  The Zapruder film clearly fixes the time of the first shot
  at frame Z-189.  Also, the Zapruder film clearly fixes the location
  of the car--and thus the President--at Z-189.  (See photo 7. 
  [NUMBER 7. This is Z-189.  <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> was slowly waving his right hand to 
  the crowd.])  There were broken white lines on the road and it can 
  be shown exactly where the car was at the time of each shot by its 
  position relative to these lines.  Knowing this, it is possible to 
  draw a line from the precise position of the President at Z-189 up 
  to the <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> "lair."  In this process, another unexplained 
  oversight of the Commission is discovered.  There is a huge oak 
  tree in front of the Book Depository building.  In November 1963 
  that tree was so large that it made it impossible for anyone to 
  have lined up a shot from the <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> window at the President at 
  Z-189.[5]  (See photos 89. [NUMBER 8. The <ent type='person'>Altgens</ent> photo.  The 
  building in the rear with a fire escape is the Dal Tex building.
  NUMBER 9. The Secret Service reenactment photo from the sixth floor
  window taken two weeks after the assassination through <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent>'s
  actual telescopic lens on his rifle.  This would have been his 
  exact view of the limousene and <ent type='person'>JFK</ent>'s head in the crosshairs at
  Z-189.])  The earliest time a shot could line up with the President
  was at Z-210.  At that time the tree was no longer in the way.
  What did the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission think?  Apparently, nothing.  It
  ignored the tree.  (See photos 1011. [NUMBERs 10, 11. Two pictures
  confirming that a shot struck <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> at Z-189.  Compare photo number 7
  with number 10.  Picture number 10 is Z-190.  <ent type='person'>JFK</ent>'s right hand 
  snaps slightly forward in 1/18 second.  From here until he goes
  behind sign (Z-204) <ent type='person'>JFK</ent>'s right hand drops steadily and begins to
  clench into a fist.  This motion continues until Z-225, after he 
  comes out from behind the sign.  Conclusion:  a shot struck <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> at
  Z-189.])
   Who then fired at Z-189?  Was it the mechanic who missed later,
  and hit Tague?  This is impossible.  (See photo 12. [NUMBER 12.*
  This is Phil <ent type='person'>Willis</ent>' fifth photo, showing <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> approaching sign;
  Zapruder in background on grassy knoll pedestal, camera at eye.
  <ent type='person'>Willis</ent> said he snapped photo in reaction to hearing first shot.
  Photo was sanpped at Z-202, confirming Z-189 was time of first 
  shot.  A similar photo taken by <ent type='person'>Hugh Betzner</ent> confirms the timing of
  this shot.])  The trajectory of that first bullet did not 
  correspond to a line from the President to that lair.  In fact, the 
  medical evidence, statements from the doctors at Parkland Hospital, 
  as well as other evidence indicates that the shot came from the 
  front.  So there had to be a third mechanic.
   At this point it is important to make certain that we have laid
  all of this out with reasonable credibility.  I have been working
  on this problem since 1963.  Many others have been working that
  long doing very specialized and very detailed work.  (See photos
  13-16. [NUMBERs 13-16.  This series of frames from the Zapruder
  film show that <ent type='person'>JFK</ent>'s right hand is still falling and clenched as he
  emerges from behind the sign (up to frame Z-225).  Note the drastic
  change in his position:  hands, head, elbows, shoulders, and arms
  (between Z-225 and Z-227) in just 2/18 of a second.  This indicates
  a second shot striking him in the back at Z-225.])  One of the best 
  of these investigators is <ent type='person'>Richard</ent> Sprague, a most experienced 
  computer technician and photographic analyst.  We know of at least 
  510 photographs taken either before, during, or after the shooting
  --all within the space of one hour.  Sprague has accounted for 
  seventy-five photographers on the scene, thirty of whom were 
  professionals from newspapers, television studios, and photographic
  agencies.  Other men, such as R.B. Cutler, <ent type='person'>Ray Marcus</ent>, Josiah 
  Thompson, <ent type='person'>David Lifton</ent>, <ent type='person'>Fred Newcomb</ent>, and <ent type='person'>Jones Harris</ent>, working 
  both independently and together with Sprague, have done the most 
  professional work on this case.  Ed Berkeley[6] published much of 
  this work in his magazine "Computers and Automation," notably in
  the May 1970 and October 1973 issues.
   It is astounding to learn that in their entire work the
  Commission was permitted to see only twenty-six of these pictures,
  and that the FBI limited its examination to some fifty of the 510.
  The Commission principals interviewed only four of the thirty
  professional photographers and saw only about a dozen of their
  several hundred photographs.  Here was evidence enough to arouse
  the interest and curiosity of any investigator.  How could all of
  this vital, most essential evidence have been kept from the
  Commission?  Today, one of the members of this Commission is
  President of the United States.  He is an intelligent and
  experienced man.  How could it have been arranged so that men such
  as <ent type='person'>Gerald Ford</ent> did not have the chance to see all of these
  photographs?  In all there were more than 25000 frames of pictures
  exposed within that crucial hour at Dealey Plaza.  (This includes
  the frames of movie camera film, some of which have been so vitally
  important when studied frame by frame.)  (See photos 17-20. 
  [NUMBERs 17-20.  This sequence of Zapruder frames shows that the 
  final and fatal shot striking <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> at Z-313, which caused an 
  enormous explosion, drove his head and upper body back and to his
  left until he bounced off the rear seat cushion at Z-321.  The
  acceleration back to the left in the first two frames following
  Z-313 have been calculated by <ent type='person'>Josiah Thompson</ent> in "Six Seconds in 
  Dallas" at more than 75 feet per second per second.  The shot 
  came from the grassy knoll, right to front.])
   Consider what real professionals can do with such evidence.  It
  is possible to build a time-phased chronological moving panorama of
  all events on Dealey Plaza from five minutes before the murder to
  ninety minutes after it.  Sprague and his associates have done
  this.  It reveals some amazingly accurate sequences.  For example,
  there is the "umbrella" man. (See photos 21-23. [NUMBER 21.  View 
  of umbrella. (Photo by <ent type='person'>Willis</ent>.)  NUMBER 22.* View of umbrella, 
  Z-227.  NUMBER 23.* Umbrella man.  Note that umbrella is folded.  
  (Photo by Bond.)])
   As the President's car rounds the corner from Houston Street
  turning left onto the fatal Elm Street, pictures show a man near a
  road sign, right next to where the President was killed.  This man
  is holding a closed umbrella in a walking-cane position.  It was
  high noon and no rain.  No one else at Dealey Plaza had an
  umbrella.  As the shots are fired, this man is seen in several
  pictures with his umbrella open and over his head (some sort of
  signal).  Then other pictures show him later with the umbrella
  lowered to his side.  Although everyone else runs from the scene
  and races around in the excitement, the umbrella man stays there
  calmly, looking around.  He is one of the last to leave the scene.
   This man shows up on a number of photographs.  His actions
  certainly do arouse suspicion, and yet the Commission did not see
  these pictures, did not know about this strange man.  He was never
  queried or identified in any way.  This is no ordinary oversight.
  This is a strange and dangerous subversion of justice.  Who did
  this?  How could such evidence have been withheld from the Chief
  Justice of the Supreme Court and other singularly respected men who
  were serving with him?  It begs credulity to attribute such gross
  errors to oversight.  How was this Commission kept from
  investigating and "seeing" such things?  This is the real issue.
   When you arrive at this question you are facing the issue of
  conspiracy.  A conspiracy that took over right from the beginning
  and began to control action even within the chambers of the
  Commission.  It is ridiculous to say that all of the Commission
  members were that dumb.  They were not.  It is ridiculous to say
  that they did not have the authority to demand more assistance,
  more facts, more investigation, and more results.  For too long,
  people have attributed such failings to the Commission.  If you do,
  then you make the Commission part of the conspiracy.  It is much
  more logical to recognize that the conspiracy controlled the
  Commission, too.
   The single-bullet theory is overly contrived, especially when
  one is attempting to solve a major crime such as the murder of a
  President.  Consider the following:</p>

<p>    * The fact that the Secret Service and the FBI both
  state three bullets were fired, but account for no
  miss.</p>

<p>    * The fact that the Commission states that three
  bullets were fired, including the near miss.</p>

<p>    * The fact that the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission missed the
  back-to-left motion of <ent type='person'>JFK</ent>'s head (see photos).</p>

<p>    * The fact that only three members of the Commission
  ever saw the Zapruder film in motion.</p>

<p>    * The fact that the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission missed seeing
  the evidence of three separate bullets hitting <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> 
  and a fourth hitting <ent type='person'>Connally</ent>;  and then 
  disregarding the "umbrella man."</p>

<p>   All of the discrepancies, one after the other, stagger the mind.
  Of course, the umbrella man could have been a perfectly innocent
  guy, why not find out?
   Then there was the "communications man."  Photo Number 24 
  [NUMBER 24. Note first large figure on the right.  He is the 
  "communications man."] shows a man across the street from the 
  umbrella man.  This man was in the crowd near Houston and Elm 
  Streets at the time of the shots.  The photo shows a two-way radio
  in the man's left hip pocket with a wire dangling down.  This wire 
  is an antenna.  What did the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission say about this?  Not
  a word.  They did not see the pictures.  This man is known.  He is 
  <ent type='person'>James Hicks</ent>, currently in an insane asylum. (See photo 25. [NUMBER
  25.* <ent type='person'>James Hicks</ent>, the "communications man."])
   There is no need to trace each error and oversight in the
  twenty-six volume report which was thrown together by the staff of
  the Commission.  Once one sees the hand of the conspiracy and the
  evidence that <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> was made the <ent type='person'>patsy</ent> and then murdered to cover
  his true role, it does not take too much deduction to see that the
  whole thing was the work of a major conspiracy and that the cover-
  up has been an even more weighty threat to our freedom.  (See
  photos 2627. [NUMBER 26. <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> holding rifle.  Photos found in
  <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent>'s garage the day after the assassination.  NUMER 27.* These
  two photos are enlargements of the two photos found in the garage.
  The line where <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent>'s real head was glued onto the two photos of
  another man's body at the chin line can be seen.  A whole series 
  of mistakes was made by the team who did this work.  One of the 
  most obvious is the way the shadow under <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent>'s nose in the two
  photos tilts with his head.  This shows that the same head photo
  was glued on at two different angles.  These fake photos taken 
  with a camera that didn't belong to <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> were accepted as totally
  valid by the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission and the FBI.  Marina <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> was 
  forced by the assassination team to testify that she took these two
  photos.])
   Why an assassination conspiracy in the first place?  Once you
  decide that it was not the work of a lone nut, then there is no
  turning away from the next step.  Why was the President killed and
  who would want to do it?  These questions must be faced, cost what
  they may, and then having faced them, they must be resolved.  This
  is what we have a government for.  Individuals cannot subpoena,
  cross-examine, or pursue for the sake of justice.  It is up to an
  honest government to do this.  But why has the government for all
  of these long years avoided this essential work?  This conspiracy
  has the power--in the face of public apathy--to control
  investigation and prosecution, or the lack thereof.
   I said earlier that it is now possible to trace the scenario of
  this master plot.  I'll try as best one man can and I'll leave it
  to you to see how far you can go along this road with me.  I'll say
  right now that the more we know about this, the more we begin to
  think of *today's* problems and the *less* we think of the <ent type='person'>JFK</ent>
  murder;  but it takes an understanding of one to face squarely the
  issue of the other.
   <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> had been in Miami in September 1963.  Prior to that, a
  Miami police informer had uncovered the existence of a plot to kill
  <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> either in Miami or in some other city.  The Miami police, in
  accordance with good practice, turned this information over to the
  FBI and the FBI informed the Miami Police that they had turned that
  information over to the Secret Service.  When <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> went to Miami, he
  was well protected to and from the airport because he traveled by
  helicopter.  This was the beginning of the plot and from that time
  on the FBI and the Secret Service should have been on maximum
  alert.  Why weren't they?  Who pulled them off the job?  Certainly
  not <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent>.  Certainly not <ent type='person'>Castro</ent>.  Certainly not Khrushchev.
   Before that time, plans were being made to have <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> visit
  Texas "for political purposes."  In accordance with this plan,
  <ent type='person'>Eugene Zuchert</ent>, then Secretary of the Air Force, had suggested,
  perhaps unwittingly, that <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> should visit San Antonio and make a
  speech at the opening of an Air Force medical facility at Brooks
  Air Force Base.  With this first step planned, someone else
  suggested that <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> should visit Fort Worth.  A bitter multi-
  billion-dollar contest over the award of the TFX (F-111) airplane
  had ended with the contract being given to the General Dynamics
  Corporation's facility in that city.  The idea was that it would
  make good sense for <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> to make political hay out of the "good
  will" that Fort Worth might have for the President.  <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> went from
  San Antonio to Fort Worth.
   Considering Texas politics, it would not have been right for the
  President to go to Fort Worth and not go to Dallas;  so plans were
  made for the President to mend fences there, too, and there were a
  lot of anti-<ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> fences in Dallas at that time.  This was done
  despite the warnings from Miami and the Miami police.  <ent type='person'>Jerry Bruno</ent>,
  <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent>'s advance man, went to Dallas.  Kenneth O'<ent type='person'>Donnell</ent>, another
  <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> aide, worked on the trip, too.  But somehow, after their
  initial work, the plans were changed.  By whom?  Who selected that
  unusual and devious route around Dealey Plaza?  It was not <ent type='person'>Bruno</ent> or
  O'<ent type='person'>Donnell</ent>.
   Then things began to get complicated.  Someone decided that the
  Vice-President, Texan <ent type='person'>Lyndon</ent> B. <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent>, should go to Dallas with
  the President, and that he and his friend <ent type='person'>John Connally</ent> should be
  in the procession with <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> and other Democratic bigwigs.  Also,
  someone else saw to it that another useful tool--<ent type='person'>Richard</ent> M. <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>-
  -should be in Dallas that day.  Indoctrination and near-complicity
  is an excellent form of discipline, spelled <ent type='person'>BLACKMAIL</ent>.  Here we
  must stop and begin another analysis.
   The Secret Service was founded on June 23, 1860.  It is an old,
  proud, and highly professional organization.  I have traveled to
  foreign countries and have worked in support of the Secret Service.
  I am familiar with its operating procedures.  I am familiar with
  what is called "Protection" in its most elaborate sense.  I was at
  the Cairo Conference and the Teheran Conference, both in 1943.  I
  participated in actions designed to safeguard the lives of the
  chiefs of state who attended those conferences.  I traveled to
  Mexico City during the tenure of President <ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent> as part of a
  mission to prepare for the security of his visit there.  I was in
  Lima, Peru in 1964 while that city went through more than three
  months of preparation for a de Gaulle visit by the famous
  "gorillas" whose skilled work kept Charles de Gaulle alive in the
  face of repeated attempts on his life.
   Because of my familiarity with these highly skilled and
  meticulous organizations, I have been doubly concerned over some of
  the events that did not take place in San Antonio, Fort Worth, and
  Dallas during and before the visit by <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> in 1963.  This is of
  extreme significance.  It is hard to teach an old dog new tricks.
  It is even harder to keep an old dog from doing his old tricks.
   How could it have happened that the Secret Service, contrary to
  all good sense and all professional "Protection" practice,
  permitted the President and the Vice-President to be in close
  proximity in the same city, in the same procession?  This is
  unheard of.  The Secret Service dates back more than a century and
  they had never permitted that to take place before.  Why this time?
   Here we must go back to our scientific and systematic perusal of
  the thousands of pictures available about this incident.  One of
  the most remarkable and important pictures taken of the entire
  25000 was one taken by James <ent type='person'>Altgens</ent>, a professional photographer
  from the Associated Press.  (See photo 8.)  By cross-referencing
  this remarkable photograph with the Zapruder film chronology, it is
  possible to determine that this picture was taken 3.6 seconds after
  the first shot was fired and 3.2 seconds before the last shot.
   This is very important.  This picture clearly shows <ent type='person'>JFK</ent>
  beginning to clench his fists.  It shows <ent type='person'>Jackie</ent>'s gloved hand
  holding his left arm just above the wrist (she begins to sense
  something is wrong).  It shows <ent type='person'>Connally</ent> sitting directly in front
  of <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> just beginning to turn to the rear as if to see what the
  trouble was.  Then it shows a carload of Secret Service men
  immediately behind the Presidential car, and save for three of
  those eight men, one would say that they were, at that moment,
  unconcerned and more or less unaware that anything was happening.
  The three men are looking to the rear either because they had been
  looking to the rear, as they are supposed to do at all times, or
  because they may have heard something from that direction.
   But then events in the third car show something quite startling.
  The third car was the Vice-President's automobile.  The driver and
  Lady Bird <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent> are smiling and unconcerned at 3.6 seconds into
  the assassination;  <ent type='person'>Lyndon</ent> and his bodyguard are sitting in their
  seats in this photo, but are partially obscured by the edge of the
  car on the left.
   Then we look at the fourth car in the procession.  This was the
  Secret Service car following the Vice-President.  Here we can see
  that a Secret Service agent by the name of <ent type='person'>Jerry Kivett</ent> has already
  opened the door of that car and that he is preparing to jump out--
  all by 3.6 seconds.
   This one indelible record of a fragment in history tells a truer
  story than all twenty-six volumes of the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> report.  It is
  possible to place the first shot at Zapruder film frame 189 and the
  <ent type='person'>Altgens</ent> photograph at Z-255.  It is interesting to note that nearly
  one half of the background of the <ent type='person'>Altgens</ent> photo is filled with that
  huge oak tree we mentioned earlier.  It has keen carefully
  researched that a rifleman in the <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> window could not possibly
  have shot at the President through that tree and thus could not
  have fired at the President until at least Z-210.  In fact, under
  the prevailing physical conditions, no one could have fired from
  that window.  (See photos 2829. [NUMBERs 28, 29. Two photographs
  showing that no one could have fired any shots from the sixth-floor
  window and that the cartons in the window were arranged to look 
  like a sniper's nest three days after the assassination.  Photo 
  number 28 is the official photo of the sniper's nest taken by 
  Dallas police photographer <ent type='person'>Robert Studebaker</ent>.  It was probably
  taken on November 25, three days later.  Photo number 29* was taken
  by "Dallas Morning News" photographer Jack Beers at 3:30 P.M. on 
  the day of the assassination.  The most important thing the photos
  show is that the real position of the boxes at the time of the 
  shots did not allow enough space for anyone to be in a firing 
  position.])  As important as this <ent type='person'>Altgens</ent> photograph is, it was 
  found that it had been severely cropped when it was tucked into the
  <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> report.  Why did someone go to that trouble?  Here again is 
  the tricky hand of the conspiracy reaching into the Commission 
  chambers.
   We have wandered a little because of the extreme importance of
  that <ent type='person'>Altgens</ent> photo.  Our objective was to show the seriousness of
  the Secret Service oversight in permitting the President and Vice-
  President to be under the same guns.
   These were not the only oversights.  I have always been
  concerned about the failure of the Secret Service to act in
  accordance with their long-established and highly professional
  standard operating procedures on <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent>'s Texas trip.  We know
  that the Secret Service does not have the numbers to permit it to
  cover every possible avenue and angle of danger;  but what we also
  know is that over the years it has keen the practice of the Secret
  Service to call upon trained elements of the Armed Forces and other
  technical assistance to flesh out their strength in compliance with
  "Protection" policy.
   In 1963 there was in Washington, D.C. the 113th Army
  Intelligence Unit, which was highly trained for this purpose.  A
  counterpart of this unit was the 112th at 4th Army Headquarters at
  Fort <ent type='person'>Sam Houston</ent>, Texas.  The 112th had a detachment, the 315th, in
  San Antonio.  Its commanding officer, among others, complained
  bitterly that his unit was not used in protection along with the
  Secret Service after he had keen told that the services of his unit
  would not be needed.  On more than one occasion he called his
  headquarters and called Washington to correct this "oversight."
  Like the old dog, he and his men had keen well trained and they
  were ready to go into action.  It takes strong and deft control
  from the top to keep a unit out of the action for which it has been
  trained.
   After the assassination, some of the men of the 112th dug into
  the unit's files and found that they had note cards on a <ent type='person'>Lee Harvey</ent>
  <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> in Dallas, Texas.  I do not know what other records they
  had;  but failure to utilize this unit and its files was part of
  the conspiracy and an indication of how far up the hand of the
  conspirators went.
   Not only did the Secret Service disregard experienced and
  qualified assistance from the Armed Forces, but they did not act in
  accordance with their own time-tested regulations.  I recall, when
  we walked down <ent type='person'>Avenida Reforma</ent> in Mexico City before <ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent>'s
  trip, being told that if we found a place where <ent type='person'>Eisenhower</ent> could
  not be properly protected, the Secret Service "manual" stated that
  the "President's car must maintain not less than 44 mph until clear
  of any danger zones."  I joked with the Secret Service officer
  about the "44 mph."  Why not "45 mph" or "50 mph."  He answered
  that tests had determined that a car traveling 44 mph was going
  fast enough to guarantee all but 100 percent assurance that the
  President would be safe.  It was Secret Service men working under
  the provisions of the same manual who let the President's car creep
  around that corner at Dealey Plaza at 8-9 mph.  Why?</p>

<p>   ____________________________________________________________________
   |  Army Aid to Help Protect President <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> Was Refused |
   |       |
   | Trained U.S. Army Intelligence Units were told their  |
   |   assisstance was not needed in Dallas during the <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> visit.  |
   |   William McKinney, a former member of the crack 112th  |
   |   Military Intelligence Group at 4th Army Headquarters, Fort  |
   |   <ent type='person'>Sam Houston</ent>, Texas, has revealed that both Col.   |
   |   <ent type='person'>Maximillian Reich</ent> and his deputy, Lt. Col. Joel Cabaza, |
   |   protested violently when they were told to "Stand Down" |
   |   rather than to report with their units for duty in    |
   |   augmentation of the Secret Service in Dallas.  McKinney |
   |   said, "All the Secret Service had to do was nod and these   |
   |   units [which had been trained at the Army's top   |
   |   Intelligence school at Camp Holabird, Maryland] would have  |
   |   performed their normal function of Protection for the   |
   |   President in Dallas."     |
   | The 315th, the Texas unit which would have been involved  |
   |   if its support had not been turned down, had records in |
   |   its files, according to McKinney, on <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent></ent>. |
   |   The 315th had a Dallas office and its records were up to  |
   |   date.       |
   | McKinney added that, "Highly specialized classes were |
   |   given at Camp Holabird on the subject of Protection.  This  |
   |   included training designed to prepare this army unit to |
   |   assist the Secret Service.  If our support had not been |
   |   refused, we would have been in Dallas."    --L.F.P. |
   |___________________________________________________________________|</p>

<p>   Also, as we looked up at the high buildings on Mexico City's
  main street, he told me that agents would check and secure each
  floor and each window of each building.  This is not as big a job
  as it may seem.  The Secret Service knows the exact timing of the
  movements of the President and they see to it, using radios and men
  on rooftops, that his progress is covered all the way.  This is
  their business and they are good at it.
   But in Dallas, for some strange reason, someone picked a
  dangerous turn in the road.  The procession passed slowly to the
  right, and then it turned slowly to the left, and all of the time
  the President's car was right under hostile windows.  How simple
  and how correct it would have keen for Secret Service men, aided by
  all of the Armed Forces required, to have checked those buildings,
  to have sealed any unused floors (such as that famous deserted
  sixth floor), and then to have shut all of the front windows.
  Then, by placing a radio-equipped man in the Plaza, all he would
  have had to do was to watch if a single window opened.  If it did,
  he would call to the man on the roof and have someone dispatched to
  check that window, and with that same call he would have alerted
  the whole force, especially those with the President's party.
   This chronology and theme need not be pursued further here.
  What is important is to point out that trained and experienced
  organizations such as the Secret Service and the Army were somehow
  given instructions not to take part.  In bureaucratic terms alone
  this is hard to do.  Each organization fights for its prerogatives
  and for its role.  Yet someone ordered them to stand down.  The
  power to keep units from operating automatically would have to have
  been extreme and must have originated close to the top.  Someone
  had to put out the word to the Secret Service and through them to
  the Army;  and then that same power was able to rebuff repeated
  attempts to right that wrong.
   Recognition of this fact leads to the delineation of the origin
  and source of the conspiracy, which was strong enough to directly
  influence the role of major government organizations even before
  the President was shot.  I have spoken with men of these units.
  Many had keen trained at Fort Holabird, the Army's top intelligence
  school.  There can be no interpretation of this suppression of the
  forces created to protect the President other than that it was a
  part of the whole conspiracy.
   Turning once more to the infallible evidence of press
  photographs, we find an excellent picture of the Texas Book
  Depository Building taken by Thomas C. Dillard.  ( See photos
  30, 31. [NUMBER 30.* Photo by Dillard shows black men on floor 
  beneath the one from where <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> supposedly fired.  NUMBER 31.
  This enlargement of the Dillard photo was used by the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent>
  Commission in connection with the testimony of the black men in the
  fifth-floor windows.  However, the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission did not 
  realize that the photo was taken within 3.5 seconds after the fatal
  head shot and therefore showed that the witnesses--who said they 
  saw a rifle sticking out of that window after the fatal shot--were
  imagining things.  Nor does the original Dillard photo show any
  rifle or anyone holding a rifle in any window of the building 3
  seconds after the last shot.])  In the procession, he was in camera
  car number three.  He took the picture only three seconds after the 
  shooting, about ten seconds after the first shot.  In this one 
  picture one can see which windows were open and which were closed 
  at that time.  Actually, the Commission severely cropped this 
  picture before it went into the report;  however, <ent type='person'>Richard</ent> Sprague 
  was able to obtain a copy of the full original.  Again, why did the
  Commission see a cropped photo rather than the full original?
   The importance of this picture is that it shows how easily and
  how effectively the role of the Secret Service can be performed
  when it is done correctly and in accordance with "Protection"
  doctrine.  An agent or an Army man placed properly in the Plaza
  could have observed all of the buildings around the Plaza and all
  of their windows.
   Further evidence of the hand of the conspiracy is found
  immediately after the shooting.  Security on the scene was almost
  nonexistent.  Photographic evidence, including the famous "tramp"
  photographs, show that ten men were "arrested" at Dealey Plaza.  No
  record of these arrests exists and there is none in the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent>
  report.
   In the case of the "tramps," those three men who were rounded up
  on orders of Police Inspector J. <ent type='person'>Herbert Sawyer</ent> (the man in charge
  of security activity at Dealey Plaza), we find a sequence of
  astounding actions.  A Sergeant D.V. <ent type='person'>Harkness</ent> was ordered to stop a
  freight train and remove the men.  <ent type='person'>Harkness</ent> arrested the three men
  and turned them over to policemen <ent type='person'>Marvin Wise</ent> and <ent type='person'>Billy Bass</ent>, who
  marched them all the way from the west side of the Book building,
  around the north side of the Plaza, and into the vehicle entrance
  of the <ent type='person'>Sheriff</ent>'s office.  Few people realize this entire procedure
  took place almost on the steps of the <ent type='person'>Sheriff</ent>'s office.  While <ent type='person'>Wise</ent>
  and <ent type='person'>Bass</ent> were marching these men to the <ent type='person'>Sheriff</ent>'s office, William
  <ent type='person'>Allen</ent>, <ent type='person'>George Smith</ent>, and Jack Beers of the "Dallas Times Herald,"
  the Fort Worth "Star Telegram," and the "Dallas Morning News," took
  several pictures of them.  Their remarkable pictures show clearly
  that <ent type='person'>Wise</ent> and <ent type='person'>Bass</ent> took them to the <ent type='person'>Sheriff</ent>'s office.  Yet <ent type='person'>Harkness</ent>
  and <ent type='person'>Sheriff</ent> <ent type='person'>Harold Elkins</ent> couldn't remember that there were any
  other policemen with <ent type='person'>Harkness</ent>.  This is utterly ridiculous in the
  face of so many clear pictures.  Why was this done?  And why
  weren't these amazing pictures shown to the Commission so that it
  could order the men before them.  And worse still, there is
  absolutely no record anywhere that these men were booked that day.
  There are no "blotter" records at all.  The men have simply
  vanished.  (See photos 32-35 [NUMBERs 32-35.* Policeman with 
  "tramps."  None of these pictures were seen by the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent>
  Commission.]).
   I have been given a list of the names of these men.  Also, the
  pictures show three policemen.  Did the <ent type='person'>Sheriff</ent>, or someone in that
  office, spirit them away?  And why did the <ent type='person'>Sheriff</ent>, who had all of
  these men in his custody, permit them to get away within minutes of
  the time that the President of the United States had been shot and
  killed on his doorstep?  These are tough questions, but let's go a
  bit further.  Why didn't the all-powerful <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission--which
  included the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the former
  Director of Central Intelligence, the man who is now our President,
  etc.--why didn't they have an opportunity to see these pictures?
  The photos would have led them to ask these questions and then to
  demand answers.
   It is this type of grossly irrational action that leads any
  concerned and level-headed person to conclude that a massive
  conspiracy had taken over and was strong enough during 1964 to
  control the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission.  No one can buy the idea that the
  <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission was that incurious, that inexperienced, and that
  stupid.  Having gone this far, it is not a long step to realize
  that this same cabal has been able to control these things for the
  past eleven years.  This is the greater crime.
   I happened to be far away in New Zealand at the time of <ent type='person'>JFK</ent>'s
  murder.  I was on my way to breakfast (the crime occured at
  6:30A.M. on the 23rd of November there) with a member of Congress
  from Ohio.  As soon as possible, we purchased the first newspaper
  available--the "Christchurch Star."  It is amazing to re-read the
  front page of that paper today and find all of the detail, the
  remarkable detail, about <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent></ent>, about his service in
  the Marine Corps, about his living in Russia, about his Russian
  wife, and then the full scenario of the crime.[7]
   Then one begins to wonder--understanding full well the
  capability of modern-day communications and reporting--who it was
  that was able in so short a time to come up with such a life
  history of so obscure a twenty-four-year-old "loner."  Even the
  Dallas police had not charged him with any crime by the time that
  paper had hit the streets.  In the crime scenario it states that
  two Dallas cops, J.D. <ent type='person'>Tippit</ent> and M.N. McDonald, had chased <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent>
  into a theater and that <ent type='person'>Tippit</ent> was shot dead "as he ran into the
  cinema."  Who fabricated all of that news?  Who was at the right
  place at that moment to flood the whole world with all of this news
  about <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent></ent>, when even the Dallas police weren't too
  sure of their man, they said, because he carried two identities
  (<ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> and <ent type='person'>Alek Hidell</ent>) in his pocket.  (See photo 36. [NUMBER 
  36.* <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent> is arrested.])  Actually fifteen policemen, one of them
  the Chief of Police for Personnel (a man who had never made an 
  arrest before), and an FBI man stormed the theater in that strange 
  episode, and <ent type='person'>Tippit</ent> did not.  He was dead outside.
   All of this proves that the American people, in their desire to
  be "loyal," can be had.  For eleven years we have been fed this
  pap.  The <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission report is trash.  Because it is trash,
  the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission either was part of the conspiracy, and as
  part of the conspiracy they used their report to cover and
  obfuscate the crime, or they, too, had been put under the control
  of that powerful cabal.
   I prefer to believe the latter.  I have known some of the men of
  that Commission and I have known about many others.  There was not
  an ignorant or stupid man on that Commission.  So they may have
  been persuaded that the better part of discretion was to put out
  the report "to soothe the public."  But is that the way to solve a
  crime or to prevent others?  Did that Commission agree, nobly, to
  let a whole team of criminals walk the streets?  This is a big
  question.
   By the end of 1964, LBJ was President and he was being carried
  along on the crest of a surging wave called Vietnam.  Few people
  have ever been able to understand our involvement in Vietnam.  It
  may be that clearing up the mystery of Dealey Plaza will help to
  clear up the mystery of Vietnam.  By 1968, <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Lyndon</ent> <ent type='person'>Johnson</ent></ent> had had
  all that one man could take of his ordeal.  Uncharacteristically,
  he announced that he was through and that he would "devote his time
  to ending the war."
   Then the guns rang out again.  <ent type='person'>Martin Luther King</ent> was shot dead
  on a motel balcony in Memphis and again we have had doubtful
  treatment about that crime.  Hardly had the dust, the flames, and
  the seething anger settled over the country when Bobby <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> was
  ambushed in Los Angeles.  It was becoming harder and harder to get
  good men to run for President.  Then out of the wreckage of 1968
  came <ent type='person'>Richard</ent> M. <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>, the man who had been kicked around but who
  was ready when called.  He became President because his real
  opposition had recently been buried in Arlington.
   After a defeat in the mid-term elections during that winter of
  our discontent in 1970-71, <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent> faced a panel of reporters on an
  ABC broadcast in January 1971.  When asked why he had been unable
  to bring the country "the lift of a driving dream" he had promised
  during the New Hampshire primaries, <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>--in one of his rare human
  moments--looked at the reporters and then mumbled, "When you have
  inherited nightmares you are unable to bring the country the lift
  of a driving dream."  A few years later that lonely, abused and--
  quite properly so--captive man won one of the strangest elections
  this country has ever seen, and then was driven from the White
  House by a nightmare of tapes spun by someone with the power to
  plant tape recorders in the White House without giving the
  President a switch that would at least enable him to turn them off
  when he swore at his brood of worldbeaters.
   It is fitting to note that <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>'s own prosecutors were from
  among the old gang who worked with the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission, and that
  he was replaced as President by a man who was the most vociferous
  member of the <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission and who had the best attendance
  record at the Commission's meetings.  All of these things are not
  random.  All of these things did not just happen accidentally.  We
  are caught up in this maelstrom and we must rise and rend this
  cloak.  Like the great magician, conspiracy is only effective as
  long as the trick is a secret.  We have the knowledge, we have the
  facts, we have the desire, and we have the power.  It is now up to
  the American people to throw off this dreaded bondage.  We have
  work to do.  We want free elections in 1976 and we want to begin a
  glorious new century of the free.</p>

<p> [1] Even the tests which "prove" it could have been done in 5.7 seconds are
   faulty.  The shots in Dallas were not fired evenly;  this is proved by
   the Zapruder film and by the Commission's own figures--Zapruder film
   frames 186-215-313.  Tests were made with a "clip" of three bullets.
   No clip was found in the Book Depository Building.</p>

<p> [2] The <ent type='person'>Warren</ent> Commission allowed even less time;  according to their
   report, the elapsed time was 5.7 seconds.</p>

<p> [3] X-rays show a piece of the bullet is still in <ent type='person'>Connally</ent>'s thigh bone,
   yet there is no fragment that size missing from that bullet.</p>

<p> [4] It is entirely possible that some technician did fire that bullet in
   this manner from that gun in order to obtain a "laboratory perfect"
   ballistics specimen.  Then, when some eager conspirators' accomplice
   got it, he "planted" it as the "Miracle" bullet.</p>

<p> [5] This is a highly technical point.  Strangely, in its manipulations,
   the Commission "notes" that a "gap occurred in the leaves of the tree
   at Z-186," then says nothing.  If there was this split-second gap,
   then the gun would have had to have been aimed and fired in that
   split second (about 1/20th of a second), and the Zapruder film tree
   would have to confirm that possibility.  It does not!</p>

<p> [7] First news reports that day said, "There were three bursts of gunfire
   from automatic weapons."  These reports were nearly correct.</p>
