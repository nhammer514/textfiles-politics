<p><ent type='person'>Skolnick</ent> COMMENTARY #015
========================</p>

<p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve 
either all or portions of the following.]</p>

<p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put 
out by a group in Chicago called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up 
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>

<p>Hi! Sherman <ent type='person'>Skolnick</ent>, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts 
[CCCC], 9800 South Oglesby.</p>

<p>&gt;From the time of <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent>'s election as President on -- strange 
events with CIA.</p>

<p>About the time of <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent>'s November '92 election a British 
Intelligence operative assisting CIA was murdered, together with 
all his family members, in southern California. That was Ian 
Stewart-Sparrow(sp?) -- having inside knowledge about the 
"October Surprise" treason, the Mena, Arkansas airport dope and 
gun smuggling implicating <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent> as Governor, and much more.</p>

<p>Right after <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent> was inaugurated, two CIA officials were 
murdered and three seriously wounded right on the road leading 
into CIA headquarters -- apparently part of a fight between CIA 
faction one: <ent type='person'>George Bush</ent> and his gang, and faction two: Naval 
Intelligence assassins.</p>

<p>And where does <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent> fit in, huh?</p>

<p>Right before the election some 15 [persons] were arrested -- 
charged with shipping exotic military items without export 
licenses to known terrorists. Among the defendants, Diane 
Lewis(sp?), a crony of first lady <ent type='person'>Hillary</ent> of Park Ridge, a 
northwest Chicago suburb. The trial was right after inauguration 
day. Ms. Lewis was released after her defense attorney told the 
judge, in chambers, she was with CIA *and* a pal of <ent type='person'>Hillary</ent>.</p>

<p>Then, the strange events in Waco, Texas, right near a CIA 
brainwashing facility. Some believe some of the Branch Davidian 
leaders knew too much. A CIA and military "delta team" murdered 
many while tanks with flame shooters burned down the compound. In 
the assault on the building two federal agents, previously 
<ent type='person'>Clinton</ent>'s campaign bodyguards, were murdered -- now get this -- 
*by their fellow agents*.</p>

<p>On July 17th, '93, President <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent> and/or someone in the White 
House acting with them (such as <ent type='person'>Vincent Foster</ent>, jr.) stopped a 
genuine CIA plot to assassinate Iraqi strongman <ent type='person'>Saddam Hussein</ent>. 
Two days later, FBI director Sessions was "sacked," on flimsy 
excuses, to block his investigation of President <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent>'s 
treasonous activities -- such as having military officers 
assigned to CIA acting as Justice Department prosecutors pursuing 
political activist civilians!</p>

<p>The next day, White House aide <ent type='person'>Foster</ent> was found murdered in a 
lower level of the White House. The Secret Service removed the 
body and planted it in a national park in Virginia. The 
circumstances, however, were designed by someone to put <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent> 
in a "catch-22" position. If <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent> revealed the details, some 
of it, somehow, might point to <ent type='person'>Foster</ent>'s law partner and lover -- 
<ent type='person'>Hillary</ent>. Did she want *him* dead to save herself from prison, 
huh?</p>

<p>Some $47 million is missing from a federally insured S&amp;L in 
Arkansas. <ent type='person'>Hillary</ent> and <ent type='person'>Foster</ent> were implicated in what seems to be 
a bank embezzlement. Federal authorities are also investigating 
CIA money-laundering deals reportedly also implicating <ent type='person'>Hillary</ent> 
and <ent type='person'>Foster</ent>.</p>

<p>The Secret Service is holding clandestine meetings across the 
nation about <ent type='person'>Foster</ent>, "picking the brains" of assassination 
experts. The Secret Service contends three foreign intelligence 
agents, disguised as known White House visitors, got into the 
White House and "wiped out" <ent type='person'>Foster</ent>. {1}. The Secret Service also 
claims a <ent type='person'>Foster</ent> "double" left the White House that afternoon -- 
all to confuse matters.</p>

<p><ent type='person'>Clinton</ent> is stonewalling release of pertinent records. Some claim 
the series of mysteries somehow involve the role of <ent type='person'>Bill</ent> and 
<ent type='person'>Hillary</ent> as CIA assets since an early age.</p>

<p>And then there's the <ent type='person'>Rick Ames</ent> spy mess at CIA which <ent type='person'>Clinton</ent> set 
on for a year. {2}.</p>

<p>--------------------------<special> Notes </special>----------------------------
{1} According to a *Wall Street Journal* article dated March 10, 
1994 ("Who is <ent type='person'>Patsy Thomasson</ent>?"), there has been lax security at 
the White House, apparently due to poor overall management.
{2} Again from the *Wall Street Journal* of March 10, 1994 ("The 
KGB and America's War on Drugs"), regarding the Ames spy case, 
"some key questions have gone unasked." Ames reportedly was 
involved with the KGB in narco-trafficking. The amount of cash 
allegedly paid to Ames was "far more than in most treason-for- 
money cases."
