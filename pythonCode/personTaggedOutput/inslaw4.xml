    Scandal Gates
   By Joel Bleifuss</p>

<p>   As CIA Director-designate <ent type='person'>Robert Gates</ent> pleads ignorance to knowledge
   of CIA misdeeds before the Senate Intelligence Committee this week,
   the lawmakers might do well to remember his sworn testimony of March
   March 6, 1986.  At the time, CIA Director <ent type='person'>William Casey</ent> had
   nominated Gates for the number-two position at the agency.  In an
   effort to impress the senators considering his nomination, Gates
   said:  "[<ent type='person'>Casey</ent>] and I have consulted extensively, even in my present
   position [as deputy director for intelligence] in all areas of
   intelligence policy including not just analysis and estimates but
   also organization, budgeting and covert action.  I will now have a
   formal role in all of these areas."
  If Gates really had "a formal role in all of these areas"--which
   appears likely--he certainly knows more than he has let on.  And
   someone should ask Gates what he knows about the <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent>
   Corporation of Coral Gables, Fla.
  As the <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent> letterhead puts in, the company provides
   "security systems and services throughout the world."  As
   <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent>'s Director of Special Investigations Service <ent type='person'>Wayne Black</ent>
   told the "Washington Times"' <ent type='person'>Deanna Hoagin</ent> earlier this year:  "We
   are similar to a private FBI."  The company's board of directors
   reads like a who's who of the intelligence community.  In 1984, for
   example, former Deputy CIA Director <ent type='person'>Bobby Inman</ent>, currently one of
   Gates' main boosters in Washington, was a director of the company.
   And among those on the 1983 board were two former FBI special
   agents, one retired Air Force general, one former commander in chief
   of the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD), one former
   director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, former CIA Director
   <ent type='person'>William Rabor</ent>, <ent type='person'>Nixon</ent>-appointed FBI Director <ent type='person'>Clarence Kelly</ent> and
   former CIA Deputy Director <ent type='person'>Frank Carlucci</ent> (who would later become
   <ent type='person'>Ronald Reagan</ent>'s national security adviser).  Further, the 1983 board
   included <ent type='person'>Robert Chasen</ent>, a former FBI special agent who was <ent type='person'>Carter</ent>'s
   commissioner of customs until 1980, when he became a vice president
   of <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent>.  Also in 1980, soon-to-be CIA chief <ent type='person'>William Casey</ent>
   served as <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent>'s outside legal counsel--the same year he
   managed the <ent type='person'>Reagan</ent>-<ent type='person'>Bush</ent> election campaign.</p>

<p>   ON THE RESERVATION:  It was in 1980 that <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent> began working
   closely with Southern California's <ent type='person'>Cabazon</ent> Indians and their tribal
   administrator <ent type='person'>John Philip Nichols</ent>.  The "San Francisco Chronicle"'s
   <ent type='person'>Jonathan Littman</ent> reported this month that <ent type='person'>Nichols</ent>, a white American
   who spent years in South American, has boasted to friends about
   working on the attempted assassination of <ent type='person'>Fidel Castro</ent> and the
   successful assassination of <ent type='person'>Salvador Allende</ent>.
  The <ent type='person'>Cabazon</ent>s hired <ent type='person'>Nichols</ent> as their administrator in 1978.
   <ent type='person'>Littman</ent> reports that thanks to <ent type='person'>Nichols</ent>' connections and
   grantsmanship, "federal and state agencies are helping to finance
   nearly $250 million worth of projects on the 1700-acre reservation"
   belonging to the 30-member <ent type='person'>Cabazon</ent> tribe.  According to <ent type='person'>Littman</ent>,
   these projects include a HUD and mafia-financed casino, a 1800-unit
   housing complex and a $150 million waste incinerator/power plant
   that was built with tax-exempt state bonds.
  But most intriguing is the <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent>/<ent type='person'>Cabazon</ent> joint venture, which
   began in 1980 when the tribe was asked to design a security system
   for Crown Prince Fahd's palace in Tiaf, Saudi Arabia.  This was
   followed by <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent>/<ent type='person'>Cabazon</ent> joint venture proposals to develop
   biological weapons for the Pentagon and assemble night-vision
   goggles for the Guatemalan and Jordanian governments.
  Why was a security firm so interested in working with a small
   tribe of native Americans?  One good reason can be found in a May
   26, 1981, inter-office memo from <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent> executive <ent type='person'>Robert Frye</ent> to
   the above-mentioned <ent type='person'>Robert Chasen</ent>.  <ent type='person'>Frye</ent> described an 11-day
   business trip with <ent type='person'>Nichols</ent> "to explore the apparent potential for
   the <ent type='person'>Cabazon</ent>-<ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent> joint venture."  <ent type='person'>Frye</ent> wrote that the
   reservation has "several key ingredients necessary" for a weapons
   plant, including "lack of opposition by adjacent governing bodies
   and `irate citizens' over the siting of such a facility."
  <ent type='person'>John Philip Nichols</ent> is no longer officially running the
   reservation.  According to <ent type='person'>Littman</ent>, son Mark <ent type='person'>Nichols</ent> is the tribal
   administrator while the elder <ent type='person'>Nichols</ent> serves as a "mental-health
   counselor to <ent type='person'>Cabazon</ent> reservation employees."  <ent type='person'>John Philip Nichols</ent>
   lost his job because federal law prohibits convicted felons from
   running casinos.
  In January, 1985, <ent type='person'>Nichols</ent> was sentenced to four years in prison
   for capital solicitation of murder.  He served 19 months.  No one
   was killed in that murder-for-hire scheme.  However, in 1981, Alfred
   <ent type='person'>Alvarez</ent>, a <ent type='person'>Cabazon</ent> Indian tribal vice president, and two non-Indians
   were murdered execution style.  <ent type='person'>Alvarez</ent>'s sister Linda Streeter
   Dukic says her brother and his friends died because they were about
   to expose mismanagement on the <ent type='person'>Cabazon</ent> reservation.  <ent type='person'>Mike Kataoka</ent> of
   the Palm Springs "Press-Enterprise" reports that in 1985, when
   <ent type='person'>Nichols</ent> was arrested for hiring the hitman, the U.S. Justice
   Department was investigating his possible involvement in those 1981
   deaths.  No charges were ever filed.</p>

<p>   ANOTHER MURDER?  The <ent type='person'>Cabazon</ent>/<ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent> connection was of particular
   interest to <ent type='person'><ent type='person'>Danny</ent> <ent type='person'>Casolaro</ent></ent>, the Washington-based journalist who was
   found dead in the Martinsburg, W. Va., Sheraton on August 10 (see
   "The First Stone," Sept. 4 [an earlier post in this on-line
   series]).  <ent type='person'>Casolaro</ent>'s friends, family and professional associates
   fear he was murdered--and that the crime was related to his
   investigations into a series of corporate and governmental scandals.
  <ent type='person'>Casolaro</ent>'s brother, <ent type='person'>Anthony</ent>, told the Washington-based "Corporate
   Crime Reporter," "<ent type='person'>Danny</ent> was trying to track monies <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent> spent
   and what <ent type='person'>Danny</ent> found was that [<ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent>] had ear-marked a half
   million dollars for what they call `research.'"
  <ent type='person'>Anthony</ent> <ent type='person'>Casolaro</ent> said that the money "ties in <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent> with this
   Indian reservation and organized crime and CIA guys . . .  Those
   same people showed up with <ent type='person'>Inslaw</ent> and one of them shows up in the
   October Surprise."
  The "October Surprise" was the alleged campaign deal between Iran
   and the 1980 <ent type='person'>Reagan</ent> campaign to delay the release of the U.S.
   hostages held in Tehran (see "In These Times," June 24, 1987, Oct.
   12, 1988 and April 27, 1991).
  "<ent type='person'>Inslaw</ent> was <ent type='person'>Inslaw</ent> Inc. of Washington D.C.--a firm that has
   brought suit in federal court, charging that the <ent type='person'>Reagan</ent> Justice
   Department stole the company's Promis case-management software
   program.  Two judges has thus far ruled in the company's favor.  The
   suit is still in the courts (see "In These Times," May 29, 1991
   ["Software Pirates," an earlier on-line post in this series]).
  Earlier this year, <ent type='person'>Inslaw</ent> further alleged that the Justice
   Department turned the stolen software over to <ent type='person'>Earl Brian</ent>, a friend
   of both former President <ent type='person'>Ronald Reagan</ent> and former Attorney General
   <ent type='person'>Edwin Meese</ent>.  <ent type='person'>Inslaw</ent> charges that the software was a payback for
   <ent type='person'>Brian</ent>'s help in arranging the October Surprise.  Former Israeli
   intelligence agent Ari Ben-Menashe alleges that <ent type='person'>Brian</ent>--now the head
   of United Press International--was directly involved in arranging
   the 1980 deal.  Ben-Menashe claims that <ent type='person'>Brian</ent> "worked very closely"
   on the deal with <ent type='person'>Robert Gates</ent>, who was then a top CIA official.</p>

<p>   NO JUSTICE:  <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent> is also linked to the <ent type='person'>Inslaw</ent> scandal.
   <ent type='person'>Michael Riconosciuto</ent>--a weapons-systems designer and software
   specialist--was director of research for the <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent>/<ent type='person'>Cabazon</ent> joint
   venture in the early '80s.  In a March 1991 affidavit for the <ent type='person'>Inslaw</ent>
   case, Riconosciuto claimed that "in connection with [Riconosciuto's]
   work for <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent>," he modified the stolen Promis software for
   foreign sales.  "Earl W. <ent type='person'>Brian</ent> made [the software program] available
   to me through <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent> after acquiring it from <ent type='person'>Peter Videnieks</ent>, who
   was then a Department of Justice contracting official with
   responsibility for the Promis software."
  <ent type='person'>Videnieks</ent>, a former Customs Service official under Commissioner
   <ent type='person'>Chasen</ent>, served in the Justice Department from 1981 through 1990.  In
   his affidavit, Riconosciuto said <ent type='person'>Videnieks</ent> had threatened to
   retaliate against Riconosciuto if he cooperated with a House
   Judiciary Committee probe of the <ent type='person'>Inslaw</ent> case.  Seven days after
   filing the affidavit (which was not, technically, part of the
   committee investigation), Riconosciuto was arrested on drug-selling
   charges.  He is now in a Seattle jail awaiting trial.</p>

<p>   PRIVATE SPIES  The 1980s were a decade of privatization.  As a for-
   profit intelligence service, <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent> appears to have taken on the
   kind of work that in earlier years the FBI and CIA would have done
   (and still do), albeit illegally.
  On the environmental-crime front, <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent> is now the object of
   an investigation by the House Interior Committee.  Early in 1990,
   the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., a consortium of seven oil
   companies that run the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, hired <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent> to
   spy on environmentalists, whistleblowers and other oil company
   critics.  <ent type='person'>Wackenhut</ent> tactics included setting up a phoney
   environmental organization and having agents pose as reporters.  It
   is alleged in press reports that the company also monitored Rep.
   <ent type='person'>George Miller</ent> (D-CA) whose house subcommittee has been investigating
   environmental crimes allegedly committed by the consortium which is
   composed of British Petroleum, Exxon, ARCO, Phillips, Unocal, Mobil
   and <ent type='person'>Amerada Hess</ent>.</p>
