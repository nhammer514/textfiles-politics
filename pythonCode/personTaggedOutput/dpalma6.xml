    ENERGY FROM SPACE
    An Engineer's Invention Excites Interest</p>

<p> In a tiny room in a Bombay suburb, an electrical engineer works
 on a machine that seems to have been conceived in a Sci-Fi book - a
 generator which can ostensibly produce electricity from nothing.</p>

<p> But the machine's  creator,  Paramahamsa  Tewari, 51,  is  not  an
 eccentric inventor from one of <ent type='person'>Sukumar Ray</ent>'s fantastic tales.  He is
 a senior engineer  with  the  Department  of Atomic Energy's Nuclear
 Power Corporation (NPC).</p>

<p> Tewari created a minor sensation 10  years  ago when he produced the
 theory that space  is  filled with a dynamic medium  whose  swirling
 motion is the source of all matter and energy.</p>

<p> He called it  the Space Vortex Theory (SVT) which postulated that at
 the heart of  the electron was a  void  whose  high  speed  rotation
 within a vacuum could produce energy from space.</p>

<p> Interestingly, it was  the  Theosophical  Society  which  had  first
 published Tewari's theory  by arranging a special lecture in 1977 at
 Adyar in Madras.</p>

<p> The theosophists were  excited  by  Tewari's  ideas  since they were
 remarkably close to observations about  the  electron put forward by
 <ent type='person'>Annie Besant</ent>'s associate, the clairvoyant Charles W.  Leadbeater, in
 the book "Occult Chemistry."</p>

<p> However, the first indication  that  Tewari's  ideas about the
 structure of space were more than just a mystic vision came earlier
 this year at  a  conference  in  Hanover  organised  by  the  German
 Association of Gravity Field Energy.</p>

<p> The Space Power Generator (SPG) invented  by  Tewari  won  the first
 prize of Rs 25000 from among 25 similar machines presented  at  the
 conference by scientists from all over.</p>

<p> Tewari's generator is actually a simple machine,  consisting
 basically of a magnetised cylinder rotating at high speed with the
 help of a motor.</p>

<p> Power from this device is extracted by connecting a wire between the
 surface of the cylinder and its axis. According  to  the engineer-
 inventor, the SPG produces two-and-a-half to three-and- a-half times
 more power than  it  consumes,  defying  the basic physical  law  of
 conservation of energy  which  says that the output of energy cannot
 be more than the input.</p>

<p> Tewari says the excess power comes  from  the  inter-atomic space of
 the rotating cylinder  - it is the movement of the  "voids"  in  the
 spinning cylinder which  creates  additional energy out of the space
 between the machine's axis and the magnet.</p>

<p> Tewari admits that his theory sounds  incredible taking into account
 the existing laws and that he would never have developed  it  had he
 been trained as  a  physicist  and  not  an engineer, since it is so
 divergent from conventional physics.</p>

<p> But, he says, it would have been  difficult  for  him  to go on with
 work on the SVT and the generator were it not for encouragement from
 two US physicists,  <ent type='person'>John</ent>  A.  Wheeler, director of  the  Centre  for
 Theoretical Physics at  the  University  of Texas, Austin, and Bruce
 DePalma, formerly a  lecturer  in physics at  the  Massachusetts
 Institute of Technology.</p>

<p> "But for DePalma, I wouldn't have been able to tie  up  my  theory,"
 says Tewari.  "He  was working on similar ideas and kept sending his
 results to me."</p>

<p> Though Tewari, who is slated for transfer to the NPC's Kaiga Project
 in Karnataka as chief project engineer,  has pursued his interest in
 physics in his  spare time, he has received infrastructural  support
 from the NPC for putting together his extraordinary new machine.</p>

<p> The SPG was  built  under Tewari's supervision at the Tarapur Atomic
 Plant.  "Tewari's prototype  SPG can be considered a major
 breakthrough," says S. L. <ent type='person'>Kati</ent>, managing director of NPC.</p>

<p> Before leaving for Hanover, Tewari addressed a meeting of scientists
 and engineers at the Bhaba Atomic Research Centre on his theory.</p>

<p> But most physicists remained sceptical about his findings.</p>

<p> Undaunted, he is experimenting with a new model of the SPG since his
 return, which he  feels will be an improvement.  He eventually hopes
 to create a prototype for a generator  which  could deliver 50 kw to
 100 kw of electricity.</p>

<p> "The encouragement I  received  abroad has been a  great  help,  and
 hopefully within a  year,  I  will  be able to build an experimental
 model which could ultimately prove commercially viable," he says.</p>

<p> Tewari, of course, is not the only  engineer  hoping  to  build  the
 ultimate power generation machine - one which will run perpetually
 since it will extract energy from space - as the Hanover conference
 demonstrated.</p>

<p> In fact, DePalma, the first inventor to create such  a  machine,  is
 presently conducting experiments  in California in anticipation of a
 breakthrough which could lead to commercial production.</p>

<p> Their work promises to create ultimately  a machine which appears to
 come straight out of a futuristic fantasy.</p>
