<p>    CONVENIENT DEATHS</p>

<p>   In the three-year period which followed the murder of President
 <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> and <ent type='person'>Lee Harvey Oswald</ent>, 18 material witnesses died - six by
 gunfire, three in motor accidents, two by suicide, one from a cut
 throat, one from a karate chop to the neck, five from natural causes.
   An actuary, engaged by the London Sunday Times, concluded that on
 November 22, 1963m the odds against these witnesses being dead by
 February 1967, were one hundred thousand trillion to one.</p>

<p>  The above comment on the deaths of assassination witnesses was published in
a tabloid companion piece to the movie _Execution Action_, released in 1973.
By that time, part of the mythology of the <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> assassination included the
mysterious deaths of people who were connected with it.
  By the mid-1960s, people in Dallas already were whispering about the
number of persons who died under strange or questionable circumstances.  Well
into the 1980s, witnesses and others were hesitant to come forward with
information because of the stories of strange and sudden death that seemed to
visit some people with information about the assassination.
  Finally, in the late 1970s, the House Select Committee on Assassinations
felt compelled to look into the matter.
  But aside from discrediting the London Sunday Times actuarial study, the
Committee was unable to come to any conclusions regarding the growing number
of deaths.  The Committee said it could not make a valid actuarial study due
to the broad number and types of persons that had to be included in such a
study.
  In response to a letter from the Committee, London Sunday Times legal
manager <ent type='person'>Anthony Whitaker</ent> stated:</p>

<p> Our piece about the odds against the deaths of the <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> witnesses
 was, I regret to say, based on a careless journalistic mistake and
 should not have been published.  This was realized by The Sunday Times
 editorial staff after the first edition - the one which goes to the
 United States... - had gone out, and later editions were amended.
 There was no question of our actuary having got his answer wrong: it
 was simply that we asked him the wrong question.  He was asked what
 were the odds against 15 named people out of the population of the
 United States dying within a short period of time, to which he replied
 - correctly - that they were very high.  However, if one asks what are
 the odds against 15 of those included in the Warren Commission Index
 dying within a given period, the answer is, of course, that they are
 much lower.  Our mistake was to treat the reply to the former question
 as if it dealt with the latter - hence the fundamental error in our
 first edition report, for which we apologize.</p>

<p>  This settled the matter for the House Committee, which apparently made
little or no attempt to seriously study the number of deaths that followed
the <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> assassination.
  <ent type='person'>Jacqueline Hess</ent>, the Committee's chief of research for the <ent type='person'>JFK</ent>
investigation, reported:</p>

<p> Our final conclusion on the issue is that the available evidence does
 not establish anything about the nature of these deaths which would
 indicate that the deaths were in some manner, either direct or
 peripheral, caused by the assassination of President <ent type='person'>Kennedy</ent> or by
 any aspect of the subsequent investigation.</p>

<p>  However, an objective look at both the number and the causes of death
balanced against the importance of the person's connection to the case, still
causes raised eyebrows among those who study such a list.
  In this section, people who were connected - no matter how tenuously -
with the assassination and who are now dead are listed according to date of
death.
  This is dealing only with deaths, not with the numerous persons - such as
<ent type='person'>Warren Reynolds</ent>, <ent type='person'>Roger Craig</ent>, and <ent type='person'>Richard Carr</ent> - who claim to have been shot
at or attacked.
  This chapter has been entitled "Convenient Deaths" because these deaths
certainly would have been convenient for anyone not wishing the truth of the
<ent type='person'>JFK</ent> assassination to become public.
  The CIA has gone to some lengths to discredit the idea of mysterious
deaths plaguing assassination witnesses.
  A 1967 memo from CIA headquarters to station chiefs advised:</p>

<p> Such vague accusations as that "more than 10 people have died
 mysteriously" can always be explained in some rational way: e.g., the
 individuals concerned have for the most part died of natural causes;
 the [Warren] Commission staff questioned 418 witnesses - the FBI
 interviewed far more people, conducting 25000 interviews and
 reinterviews - and in such a large group, a certain number of deaths
 are to be expected.</p>

<p>  Testifying before the Church Committee in 1975, CIA technicians told of a
variety of TWEP technology - Terminate With Extreme Prejudice - that cannot
be detected in a postmortem examination.
  One recently declassified CIA document, a letter from an Agency consultant
to a CIA officer, states:</p>

<p> You will recall that I mentioned that the local circumstances under
 which a given means might be used might suggest the technique to be
 used in that case.  I think the gross divisions in presenting this
 subject might be:
 (1) bodies left with no hope of the cause of death being determined by
 the most complete autopsy and chemical examinations
 (2) bodies left in such circumstances as to simulate accidental death
 (3) bodies left in such circumstances as to simulate suicidal death
 (4) bodies left with residue that simulates those caused by natural
 diseases.</p>

<p>  The letter goes on to show that undetected murders do not have to be the
result of sophisticated chemicals.  It states:</p>

<p> There are two techniques which I believe should be mentioned since
 they require no special equipment besides a strong arm and the will to
 do such a job.  These would be either to smother the victim with a
 pillow or to strangle him with a wide piece of cloth such as a bath
 towel.  In such cases, there are no specific anatomic changes to
 indicate the cause of death...</p>

<p>  While it is obvious that the CIA - and hence the mob through operatives who
work for both - has the capability of killing, it is less well known that the
Agency has developed drugs to induce cancer.
  Recall that <ent type='person'>Jack Ruby</ent> died of sudden lung cancer just as he had been granted
a new trial.
  A 1952 CIA memo reported on the cancer-causing effects of beryllium:
"This is certainly the most toxic inorganic element and it produces a
peculiar fibrotic tumor at the site of local application.  The amount
necessary to produce these tumors is a few micrograms."
  Local law-enforcement officers and coroners are not equipped, either by
training or by inclination, to detect deaths induced by such sophisticated
means.  They look for signs of a struggle, evidence of a break-in, bruises,
or marks on the victim.
  With no evidence to the contrary, many deaths are ruled suicide or accident.
Others are ruled due to natural causes, such as heart attack.
  It is interesting to note how the deaths are grouped.  Many of the
earliest deaths came during the time of the Warren Commission investigation
or just afterwards.
  More deaths took place in the late 1960s as New Orleans District Attorney
<ent type='person'>Jim Garrison</ent> was launching his investigation.  Other suspicious deaths
occurred during the mid-1970s, as the Senate Intelligence Committee was
looking into assassinations by U.S. intelligence agencies.  And finally,
another spate of deaths came around 1977, just as the House Select Committee
on Assassinations was gearing up its investigation.
  These deaths are listed below in chronological order.  An asterisk means
the death is a particularly suspicious one.  They are also grouped according
to which investigation was being conducted at the time.
  The possibility of convenient deaths leads one into a well of paranoia, yet
this long list cannot be summarily dismissed.
  Obviously, many of these deaths - particularly in recent years - can be
ascribed to the passage of time.  But others cannot - especially when viewed
in the context of the assassination inquiries taking place at the time.
  Read for yourself and consider... When does coincidence end and conspiracy
begin?</p>

<p>   1977 - A Terrible Year for Many</p>

<p>  The year 1977 produced a bumper crop of candidates for listing under
convenient deaths connected with the <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> assassination - including the deaths
of six top FBI officials all of whom were scheduled to testify before the
House Select Committee on Assassinations.
  Topping this list was former number-three man in the FBI, William C.
<ent type='person'>Sullivan</ent>, who had already had a preliminary meeting with the investigators
for the House Committee.  <ent type='person'>Sullivan</ent> was shot with a high-powered rifle near
his New Hampshire home by a man who claimed to have mistaken him for a deer.
The man was charged with a misdemeanor - "shooting a human being by
accident" - and released to the custody of his father, a state policeman.
There was no further investigation of <ent type='person'>Sullivan</ent>'s death.
  <ent type='person'>Louis Nichols</ent> was a special assistant to J. <ent type='person'>Edgar Hoover</ent> as well as
<ent type='person'>Hoover</ent>'s liaison with the Warren Commission.  Alan H. Belmont also was a
special assistant to <ent type='person'>Hoover</ent>.  <ent type='person'>James Cadigan</ent> was a document expert with access
to many classified assassination documents, while J.M. English headed the FBI
laboratory where <ent type='person'>Oswald</ent>'s rifle and pistol were tested.  <ent type='person'>Donald Kaylor</ent> was
the FBI fingerprint expert who examined prints found at the assassination
scene.  None of these six Bureau officials lived to tell what they knew to
the House Committee.
  Other key assassination witnesses, such as George DeMohrenschildt and
former Cuban president <ent type='person'>Carlos Prio Soccaras</ent>, died within weeks of each other
in 1977, just as they, too, were being sought by the House Committee.
  The ranks of both organized crime and U.S. intelligence agencies were
thinned by deaths beginning in 1975, the time of the Senate Intelligence
Hearings, and 1978, the closing months of the House Committee.
  <ent type='person'>Charles Nicoletti</ent>, a mobster connected with the CIA-Mafia assassination
plots, was murdered in Chicago, while <ent type='person'>William Pawley</ent>, a former diplomat
connected with both organized crime and CIA figures, reportedly committed
suicide.
  Adding to rumors that "hit teams" may have been at work, a Time magazine
article reported that federal agents had initiated a nationwide investigation
into more than 20 gangland assassinations constituting what agents believed
was an "open underworld challenge to governmental infiltration of Mafia
activities."
  One FBI source was quoted as saying: "Our main concern is that we may be
facing a revival of the old `Murder, Inc.' days."
  A New York News story concerning this official fear of roving
assassination squads even mentions the death of <ent type='person'>Sam Giancana</ent>, who was killed
one day before he was scheduled to testify about mob-CIA connections and
while under government protection.
  Prior to the House Committee investigation into the <ent type='person'>JFK</ent> assassination,
the news media reported the following deaths:</p>
