<xml><p>THE <ent type='ORG'>BOHEMIAN</ent> CLUB</p>

<p> For two and a half weeks every July, two thousand of the top
movers and shakers in business and government attend the <ent type='NORP'>Bohemian</ent>
Club's summer encampment. Although highly selective, the club has
a national membership and is among the most prestigious of
affiliations in neoconservative circles. Its membership is known
to include Ronald Reagan, <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Gerald Ford</ent>, William F.
Buckley, Jr., <ent type='PERSON'>Frank Borman</ent>, Justin Dart, <ent type='PERSON'>William Randolph Hearst</ent>,
Jr., <ent type='PERSON'>Caspar Weinberger</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Charles Percy</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>George Schultz</ent>, Edward
Teller, <ent type='PERSON'>Merv Griffin</ent>, and a large proportion of the directors and
chief executive officers of the Fortune 1000. Daniel Ludwig, the
richest private citizen on earth, is a <ent type='NORP'>Bohemian</ent>. Conspiracy nuts
think <ent type='ORG'>the Bohemian Club</ent> meets each summer to plot to take over the
world. These guys ALREADY run the world.
The club's name harkens back to its founding in 1872 by
artists and journalists in <ent type='LOC'>the Bay Area</ent>; the club proper is at 624
Taylor Street in <ent type='GPE'>San Francisco</ent>. The annual summer camp is held at
"<ent type='NORP'>Bohemian</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Grove</ent>," an isolated site in <ent type='GPE'>Sonoma County</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>,
near the town of <ent type='GPE'>Monte Rio</ent>. To get there, you cross the bridge
over the <ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent> River and take the second left.
Signs warn off trespassers, and the <ent type='ORG'>Grove</ent> is guarded during
the encampment. Visitors must have invitations and sign in and
out; cooks and other workers have to wear ID badges. The club (and
hired staff) is all male. There are no black <ent type='NORP'>Bohemian</ent>s and just
one <ent type='NORP'>Asian</ent>; the former <ent type='NORP'>Philippine</ent> president <ent type='PERSON'>Carlos Romulo</ent>.
The club does a good job of avoiding publicity, although in
1980 <ent type='PERSON'>Rick Clogher</ent>, a writer for <ent type='ORG'>MOTHER JONES</ent> magazine, managed to
slip in to the encampment for four days with the help of an
unidentified insider. Brooding over the <ent type='ORG'>Grove</ent> is a giant rock that
looks like an owl. <ent type='PERSON'>Clogher</ent> discovered that the rock is concrete,
covered with moss to look natural. <ent type='ORG'>The Cremation</ent> of Care ritual
takes place in front of the owl when, on the first night of camp,
robed members burn a doll representing <ent type='ORG'>Dull Care</ent>.
<ent type='NORP'>Bohemian</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Grove</ent> includes 122 distinct camps in its 2700
acres. The camps have whimsical names such as <ent type='ORG'>Whiskey Flat</ent>,
<ent type='LOC'>Toyland</ent>, Owl's Nest, Hill Billies, and Cave Man's, and each one
has its own kitchen-bar building -- there is a lot of drinking --
and sleeping quarters. The members of some camps sleep in tents;
other camps have redwood cabins. Daily "Lakeside Talks" on
geopolitical topics are given by prominent speakers, both members
and non-members. It is claimed that <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Nixon</ent> and Ronald
Reagan conferred during the 1967 encampment, Reagan agreeing not
to challenge <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> for the presidential nomination.
The highlight of camp is the <ent type='ORG'>Grove</ent> play, which is written
exclusively for the club. All the female roles are played by men
in drag. The 1980 play was an adaptation of the <ent type='NORP'>Greek</ent> myth of
Cronus and Zeus supplemented with fireworks, smoke bombs, and a
light show. (One can only wonder if Reagan ever starred in a <ent type='ORG'>Grove</ent>
play. He certainly has more acting experience than most club
members.) The polished productions cost the <ent type='NORP'>Bohemian</ent>s as much as
$25000 -- for one performance.</p>
