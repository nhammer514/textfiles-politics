<p>"Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be driven by
a power obtainable at any point in the universe. This idea
is not novel... We find it in the delightful myth of
<ent type='PERSON'>Antheus</ent>, who derives power from the earth; we find it among
the subtle speculations of one of your splendid
mathematicians... Throughout space there is energy. Is
this energy static or kinetic.? If static our hopes are in
vain; if kinetic - and this we know it is, for certain -
then it is a mere question of time when men will succeed
in attaching their machinery to the very wheelwork of
nature."

<ent type='ORG'>Nikola</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> addressing <ent type='ORG'>the American Institute</ent> of Electrical
Engineers, 1891.</p>



<p>"There manifests itself in the fully developed being - Man
- a desire mysterious, inscrutable and irresistible: to
imitate nature, to create, to work himself the wonders he
perceives.... Long ago he recognized that all
perceptible matter comes from a primary substance, or
tenuity beyond conception, filling all space, the <ent type='ORG'>Akasa</ent> or
luminiferous ether, which is acted upon by the life giving
<ent type='PERSON'>Prana</ent> or creative force, calling into existence, in never
ending cycles all things and phenomena. The primary
substance, thrown into infintesimal whirls of
prodigious velocity, becomes gross matter; the force
subsiding, the motion ceases and matter disappears,
reverting to the primary substance."

<p>"The first thing to realize about the ether is its absolute
continuity. A deep sea fish has probably no means of
apprehending the existence of water; it is too uniformly
immersed in it: and that is our condition in regard to the
ether."

Sir <ent type='PERSON'>Oliver Lodge</ent>, Ether and Reality.</p>



<p>"So astounding are the facts in this connection, that it
would seem as though the Creator, himself had electrically
designed this planet...."

Resonance (7.8Hz) in "<ent type='ORG'>The Transmission</ent> of Electrical Energy
Without Wires As A Means Of Furthering World Peace",
Electrical World And Engineer, January 7, 1905, PP 21-24.</p>
