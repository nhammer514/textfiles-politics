SECRET CONCENTRATION CAMPS

The September issue of <ent type='ORG'>THE OSTRICH</ent> reprinted a story from the
<ent type='ORG'>CBA</ent> BULLETIN which listed the following principal civilian concentration camps established in <ent type='ORG'>GULAG USA</ent> under the =<ent type='ORG'>Rex</ent> '84= program:
Ft. Chaffee, <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent>; Ft. Drum, <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent>; Ft. <ent type='NORP'>Indian</ent> Gap, <ent type='GPE'>Pennsylvania</ent>; Camp A. P. Hill, <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent>; <ent type='GPE'>Oakdale</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>; Eglin

Krome, <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>. The February OSTRICH printed a map of the expanding
<ent type='ORG'>Gulag</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>Alhough</ent> this listing and map stirred considerable interest,
the report was not new. For at least 20 years, knowledgeable <ent type='ORG'>Patriots</ent>
have been warning of these sinister plots to incarcerate dissidents
opposing plans of the =Elitist Syndicate= for a totalitarian
=<ent type='EVENT'>New World</ent> Order=. Indeed, the plot was recognized with the insidious
encroachment of "regionalism" back in the 1960's. As early as 1968,
the "greatest land steal in history" leading to global corporate
socialism, was in a ="Master Land Plan"= for <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States
by =<ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Orders= involving water resource regions,
population movement and control, pollution control, zoning
and land use, navigation and environmental bills, etc. Indeed,
the real undercover aim of the so-called "Environmental Rennaissance"
has been the abolition of private property.
All prelude to the total grab of the =<ent type='ORG'>World Conservation Bank</ent>=,
as <ent type='ORG'>THE OSTRICH</ent> has been reporting. The map on this page and
the list of executive orders available for imposition of an "emergency"

land, can be put into effect at any time an emergency is declared:

10995--All communications media seized by <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Government</ent>.
10997--Seizure of all electrical power, fuels, including
gasoline and minerals.

11001--Federal takeover of all health, education and welfare.
11002--Postmaster General empowered to register every man, woman
and child in the U.S.A.
11003--Seizure of all aircraft and airports by the Federal
Government.
11004--Housing and Finance authority may shift population from
one locality to another. <ent type='ORG'>Complete</ent> integration.

to put <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Orders into effect in "times of increased
international tension or financial crisis". He is also to
perform such additional functions as the President
may direct.

A Dangerous Fact Not Generally Known
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS GROSSLY AND FLAGRANTLY VIOLATE ARTICLE
4 SECTION 4 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF <ent type='GPE'>THE UNITED STATES</ent>. "THE
UNITED STATES SHALL GUARANTEE TO EVERY STATE IN THIS UNION A
REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT, AND SHALL PROTECT EACH OF THEM
AGAINST INVASION; AND ON APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE, OR OF THE
EXECUTIVE (WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT BE CONVENED) AGAINST
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE." "REGIONAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT A REPRESENTATIVE
REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT!"

When Government gets out of hand and can no longer be controlled
by the people, short of violent overthrow as in 1776, there are
two sources of power which are used by the dictatorial government
to keep the people in line: <ent type='ORG'>the Police Power</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>the Power</ent> of the
Purse (through which the necessities of life can be withheld).
And both of these powers are no longer balanced between the three
Federal Branches, and between the Federal and the State and
local Governments. These powers have been taken over, with the
permission of <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Legislature</ent> and the State Governments,
by <ent type='ORG'>the Executive Branch</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Government</ent> and all attempts
to reclaim that lost power have been defeated.

Stated simply: the dictatorial power of the <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> rests primarily
on three basis: <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Order 11490, <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Order 11647, and
<ent type='ORG'>the Planning</ent>, Programming, Budgeting System which is operated
through the new and all-powerful Office of Management and
Budget.

E. O. 11490 is a compilation of some 23 previous <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Orders,
signed by <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> on Oct. 28, 1969, and outlining emergency functions
which are to be performed by some 28 <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Departments and
Agencies whenever the President of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States declares
a national emergency (as in defiance of an impeachment edict,
for example). Under the terms of E. O. 11490, the President
can declare that a national emergency exists and the <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent>
Branch can:
* Take over all communications media
* Seize all sources of power
* Take charge of all food resources
* Control all highways and seaports
* Seize all railroads, inland waterways, airports, storage facilities
* Commandeer all civilians to work under federal supervision
* Control all activities relating to health, education, and welfare
* Shift any segment of the population from one locality to another
* Take over farms, ranches, timberized properties
* Regulate the amount of your own money you may withdraw from
your bank, or savings and loan institution

All of these and many more items are listed in 32 pages incorporating
nearly 200000 words, providing and absolute bureaucratic
dictatorship whenever the President gives the word.

--&gt; <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Order 11647 provides the regional and local mechanisms
--&gt; and manpower for carrying out the provisions of E. O. 11490.
--&gt; Signed by Richard <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> on Feb. 10, 1972, this Order sets up Ten
--&gt; <ent type='ORG'>Federal Regional Councils</ent> to govern <ent type='ORG'>Ten Federal Regions</ent> made up
--&gt; of the fifty still existing States of the Union.

The President need not wait for some emergency such as an impeachment
ouster. He can declare a National Emergency at any time, and freeze
everything, just as he has already frozen wages and prices. And
the <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, and the States, are powerless to prevent such an
<ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Dictatorship, unless <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> moves to revoke these
extraordinary powers before the Chief <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> moves to invoke

A war, even the most victorious, is a national misfortune.
--<ent type='PERSON'>Helmuth Von Moltke</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>Prussian</ent> field marshall

George <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> put <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States on the road to its second war in
two years by declaring a national emergency on August 21990. In
response to Iraq's invasion of <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> issued two <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent>
Orders (12722 and 12723) which restricted trade and travel with <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>
and froze <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>i and <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>i assets within the U.S. and those in the
possession of U.S. persons abroad. At least 15 other executive orders
followed these initial restrictions and enabled the President to
mobilize the country's human and productive resources for war. Under
the national emergency, <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was able unilaterally to break his 1991
budget agreement with <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> which had frozen defense spending, to
entrench further the U.S. economy in the mire of the military-industrial complex, to override environmental protection regulations,
and to make free enterprise and civil liberties conditional upon an
executive determination of national security interests.

The State of Emergency
In time of war a president's power derives from both constitutional
and statutory sources. Under Article II, Section 2 of the
Constitution, he is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Although
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> alone retains the right to declare war, this power has become
increasingly meaningless in the face of a succession of unilateral
decisions by the executive to mount invasions.
The president's statutory authority, granted by <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and
expanded by it under the 1988 National Emergencies Act (50 <ent type='ORG'>USC</ent> sec.
1601), confers special powers in time of war or national emergency.
He can invoke those special powers simply by declaring a national
emergency. First, however, he must specify the legal provisions under
which he proposes that he, or other officers, will act. <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> may
end a national emergency by enacting a joint resolution. Once invoked
by the president, emergency powers are directed by the National
Security Council and administered, where appropriate, under the
general umbrella of <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Emergency Management Agency</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>).[1]
There is no requirement that <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> be consulted before an emergency
is declared or findings signed. The only restriction on <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> is that
he must inform <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> in a "timely" fashion--he being the sole
arbiter of timeliness.
Ultimately, the president's perception of the severity of a
particular threat to national security and the integrity of his
appointed officers determine the nature of any state of emergency.
For this reason, those who were aware of the modern development of
presidential emergency powers were apprehensive about the domestic
ramifications of any national emergency declared by George <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>. In
light of Bush's record (see "<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> Chips Away at Constitution" Box
below) and present performance, their fears appear well-founded.

<ent type='EVENT'>The War</ent> at Home
It is too early to know all of the emergency powers, executive
orders and findings issued under classified National Security
Directives[2] implemented by <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> in the name of <ent type='EVENT'>the Gulf War</ent>. In
addition to the emergency powers necessary to the direct mobilization
of active and reserve armed forces of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States, there are
some 120 additional emergency powers that can be used in a national
emergency or state of war (declared or undeclared by <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>). The
"<ent type='ORG'>Federal Register</ent>" records some 15 <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Orders (EO) signed by
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> from August 21990 to February 141991. (See "Bush's <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent>
Orders" box, below)
It may take many years before most of the executive findings and
use of powers come to light, if indeed they ever do. But evidence is
emerging that at least some of Bush's emergency powers were activated
in secret. Although only five of the 15 EOs that were published were
directed at non-military personnel, the costs directly attributable to
the exercise of the authorities conferred by the declaration of
national emergency from August 2, 1990 to February 1, 1991 for non-military activities are estimated at approximately $1.3 billion.
According to a February 11, 1991 letter from <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> to congressional
leaders reporting on the "<ent type='ORG'>National Emergency With Respect</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>,"
these costs represent wage and salary costs for <ent type='ORG'>the Departments</ent> of
Treasury, State, Agriculture, and Transportation, U.S. Customs,
<ent type='ORG'>Federal Reserve Board</ent>, and <ent type='ORG'>the National Security Council</ent>.[3]
The fact that $1.3 billion was spent in non-military salaries alone
in this six month period suggests an unusual amount of government
resources utilized to direct the national emergency state. In
contrast, government salaries for one year of the state of emergency
with <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>[4] cost only $430000.

____________________________________________________________________
| <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> Chips Away at Constitution
| George <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, perhaps more than any other individual in
U.S. history, has expanded the emergency powers of
presidency. In 1976, as Director of <ent type='ORG'>Central Intelligence</ent>,
he convened Team B, a group of rabidly anti-communist
intellectuals and former government officials to reevaluate
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> inhouse intelligence estimates on <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> military
strength. The resulting report recommended draconian civil
defense measures which led to President Ford's <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent>
Order 11921 authorizing plans to establish government
control of the means of production, distribution, energy
sources, wages and salaries, credit and the flow of money
in U.S. financial institutions in a national emergency.[1]
As Vice President, <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> headed <ent type='ORG'>the Task Force</ent> on
Combatting Terrorism, that recommended: extended and
flexible emergency presidential powers to combat terrorism;
restrictions on congressional oversight in counter-terrorist planning; and curbing press coverage of
terrorist incidents.[2] The report gave rise to <ent type='ORG'>the Anti</ent>-Terrorism Act of 1986, that granted the President clear-cut
authority to respond to terrorism with all appropriate
means including deadly force. It authorized the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to control and
remove not only alien terrorists but potential terrorist
aliens and those "who are likely to be supportive of
terrorist activity within the U.S."[3] The bill superceded
the War Powers Act by imposing no time limit on the
President's use of force in a terrorist situation, and
lifted the requirement that the President consult <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>
before sanctioning deadly force.
From 1982 to 1988, <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> led the Defense Mobilization
Planning Systems <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>DMPSA</ent>), a secret government
organization, and spent more than $3 billion upgrading
command, control, and communications in FEMA's continuity
of government infrastructures. Continuity of Government
(<ent type='ORG'>COG</ent>) was ostensibly created to assure government
functioning during war, especially nuclear war. The <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>
was so secret that even many members of the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> were
unaware of its existence and most of its work was done
without congressional oversight.
Project 908, as the <ent type='ORG'>DMPSA</ent> was sometimes called, was
similar to its parent agency <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> in that it came under
investigation for mismanagement and contract
irregularities.[4] During this same period, <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> had been
fraught with scandals including emergency planning with a
distinctly anti-constitutional flavor. The agency would
have sidestepped <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and other federal agencies and
put the President and <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> directly in charge of the U.S.
planning for martial rule. Under this state, the executive
would take upon itself powers far beyond those necessary to
address national emergency contingencies.[5]
Bush's "anything goes" anti-drug strategy, announced
on September 6, 1989, suggested that executive emergency
powers be used: to oust those suspected of associating
with drug users or sellers from public and private housing;
to mobilize <ent type='ORG'>the National Guard</ent> and U.S. military to fight
drugs in the continental U.S.; to confiscate private
property belonging to drug users, and to incarcerate first
time offenders in work camps.[6]
The record of Bush's fast and loose approach to
constitutionally guaranteed civil rights is a history of
the erosion of liberty and the consolidation of an imperial
executive.
