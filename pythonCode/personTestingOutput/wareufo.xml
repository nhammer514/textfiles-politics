<p>By BILL KACZOR Associated Press Writer
FORT <ent type='GPE'>WALTON BEACH</ent>, Fla. (AP) -- A retired <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> pilot says he
suspects, contrary to official denials, an unknown federal agency is
investigating reports of unidentified flying objects and other close
encounters with extraterrestrial beings.
Donald M. <ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent> state director of <ent type='ORG'>the Mutual UFO Network Inc</ent>., a
private "ufology" organization, says he doesn't have any direct knowledge but
nearly a lifetime of study leads him to believe probes are secretly being
conducted by some national intelligence agency.
"That idea doesn't bother me. I don't mind being an unequal partner," <ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent>
said in a recent interview. "I support the policy of secrecy."
He said secrecy would be necessary because, official statements
notwithstanding, he is convinced the subject involves national security in the
form of advanced alien technology.
<ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent> said he intends to take that message to the Annual <ent type='ORG'>MUFON</ent> UFO Symposium
June 26-28 at <ent type='ORG'>American University</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C., where he is to be part
of a panel discussion on UFOs and the government.
His position is unlikely to be shared by many UFO investigators, <ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent>
admitted. A common complaint of ufologists is the government's professed lack
of interest and its failure to cooperate with private UFO studies.
"I'm so bold as to suggest there is a possibility of cooperation with some
unknown government agency if we show a little more tolerance of their policy
of secrecy," <ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent> said.
"As long as we publicly take such an antagonistic attitude, as long as we
place the government in an adversarial relationship," <ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent> said, "we are not
going to get much cooperation from them whoever they are."
The <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> closed its <ent type='ORG'>Project Blue Book</ent> investigation of more than
12000 UFOs in 1969 after a panel of scientists found no evidence of visitors
from outer space. Most sightings were found to be such things as planets,
stars, meteors, weather balloons, satellites, false radar echoes, marsh gas,
clouds, aircraft or optical illusions, but a few have remained unexplained.
The official word ever since has been that the government has nothing to do
with UFO investigations and whatever they might be they pose no threat to
national security.
<ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent>, 51, joined the service in 1957. He said he was uninvolved in the Air
Force's UFO activities during his 26-year military career as a teacher, staff
scientist and fighter pilot, including two combat tours in <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>.
"That's one reason I can speak so freely," he said. "I have no information
from the <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent>."
His interest began as a teen-ager in 1952 when he saw star-like objects
streaking through the sky while walking near his home in the nation's capital.
Similar sightings, including radar returns, had been reported a week earlier
and <ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent> said they remain unexplained.
He began reading everything about UFOs he could get his hands on, including
books in the library at <ent type='ORG'>Duke University</ent> where he received a mechanical
engineering degree. He later earned a master's degree in nuclear engineering
from the <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> Institute of Technology.
<ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent> kept up his interest in UFOs, building up a personal library on the
subject and questioning other pilots.
"I had no qualms about saying, 'Anybody seen a UFO?' " <ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent> said. The
answer, he said, usually was "yes."
However, until March of 1970, military personnel were ordered not to talk
about UFOs, <ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent> said.
"I think that in the late '40s and early '50s the U.S. government really
wanted the public to tell them what they saw and that those people primarily
responsible for investigating UFOs were not listed in the phone book," <ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent>
said. "The U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> was chosen as <ent type='PERSON'>Uncle Sam</ent>'s public relations agent
because they were listed in the phone book."
No one thing has convinced him of government involvement, <ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent> said. "Two
years of study after I saw the UFOs in 1952 convinced me that somebody is
watching us," he said. "Ten more years of study caused me to think somebody
in our government has known that as a fact at least since 1947."
<ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent> said his goals in becoming state director of <ent type='ORG'>MUFON</ent>, an international
scientific organization based in <ent type='GPE'>Seguin</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, were to improve relations
between "ufologists" and the government and to learn all he could about alien
technology from abductees and other witnesses of close encounters.
<ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent> said he hasn't seen any more UFOs since 1952 and doesn't expect to.
"I haven't been selected," he said. He still scans the skies, but not for
UFOs. When he's not investigating UFO reports or giving talks about the
subject to civic groups, he is bird watching. He is treasurer of and runs an
annual bird count for <ent type='ORG'>the Choctawhatchee Audubon Society</ent> and does surveys for
the <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent> Breeding Bird Atlas project.
<ent type='ORG'>Ware</ent> said his two avocations are unrelated. "Lots of people have accused
me of getting a lot of satisfaction from identifying feathered objects," he
said, grinning. "No, I'm just a nature boy."
