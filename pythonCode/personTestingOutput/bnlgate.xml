<p> <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> - <ent type='GPE'>IRAQGATE</ent> SCANDAL </p>

<p> The <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> Connection - <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> &amp; <ent type='ORG'>Saddam Inc</ent>.
Key documents - sought by <ent type='PERSON'>Gonzalez</ent> - withheld </p>

<p> With <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent> ready to take <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> into another war with <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> to
destroy the nuclear, chemical, biological and missiles weapons that <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
himself helped <ent type='PERSON'>Saddam Hussein</ent> to build, <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>men Henry <ent type='PERSON'>Gonzalez</ent>, the
courageous <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent> who heads <ent type='ORG'>the House Banking Committee</ent>, continues,
single-handedly, to peel back layer after layer of cover-up to reveal the
monumental proportions of the <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>gate-<ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro</ent>)
scandal that now threatens to bring down the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> regime. But the most
explosive documents have been withheld. </p>

<p> Over the past several months <ent type='PERSON'>Gonzalez</ent> has shown the <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>gate-<ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> scandal to be bigger than anyone had imagined. He has uncovered and
reported incontestable evidence that <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and his associates secretly sold
nuclear, biological, chemical and missile-related weapons materials to
<ent type='PERSON'>Saddam Hussein</ent>; blocked investigations into the use of such materials by
<ent type='PERSON'>Hussein</ent>; suppressed memos warning of the dangers of such sales;
deliberately falsified documents on such sales submitted to <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and
interfered illegally to halt investigations into the criminal activities of
the <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> bank in secretly diverting <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n agricultural loans to buy the
weapons for <ent type='PERSON'>Hussein</ent>. </p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> Branches </p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Gonzalez</ent> has revealed a <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> policy disaster that lead to the first
<ent type='EVENT'>Gulf War</ent> and a blunder that is now costing the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns $2 billion to pay
off the loans <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> guaranteed with U.S. taxpayersU money . <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> repeatedly
ignored warnings that <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> would default on the loans. Now, certain key
documents - perhaps the most revealing yet - are being withheld from the
<ent type='PERSON'>Gonzalez</ent> investigation. They are said to be the records of the <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>
branches of <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> (Bank of Credit and Commerce International),
through which, some investigators say , <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Saddam Hussein</ent> may
have been involved in a joint, private enterprise to skim oil profits
arising from Reagan-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> policies toward <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>. The documents have been
impounded by a <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> court and <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>man <ent type='PERSON'>Gonzalez</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Banking Committee</ent>
has been denied access. </p>

<p> Bush's <ent type='ORG'>Pennzoil</ent> Profits </p>

<p> Between 1980 and 1990 the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> region exported a trillion dollars
worth of oil to the West. Hundreds of billions of dollars in kickbacks were
involved. Some of the kickbacks were said to be handled by the <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent>/<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>
banks for <ent type='ORG'>Pennzoil</ent>, an oil company founded by <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent> The <ent type='ORG'>Pennzoil</ent>
case was (is?) the target of <ent type='PERSON'>Ross</ent> PerotUs much-denied investigation of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> family and friends. Investigators believe the <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> bank records
could help explain <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>Us massive, covert military support for <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> in the
years between 1981-1990. </p>

<p> The <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> /<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> records could also provide clues to why the
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> Administration secretly - and possibly illegally - exempted eleven
members of the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> cabinet from conflict of interest restrictions in their
handling of the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> war policy. <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> simply declared that the law
regarding conflict of interest would cease to apply to his advisors on the
<ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> war policy. He then ordered that his declaration would be not be made
public. <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>man <ent type='PERSON'>Gonzalez</ent> is now asking <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> to explain the deal. <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
has not responded. </p>

<p> According to some investigators, the <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> bank documents
now impounded by a <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> judge could shed light not only on the
<ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>gate case, but on other illegal transactions including <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>-Contra,
October Surprise and the <ent type='ORG'>Inslaw</ent> case. In all instances monies passed
through the <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent>/<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> banking network. </p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> is an <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> bank now under investigation by <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> for
fraud in using loans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to finance
<ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>Us pre-war military buildup. Over the past thirty years, <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> is
suspected of involvement in a wide range of international criminal
activities. (<ent type='ORG'>French Intelligence</ent> investigators have even linked the bank to
large payments to certain individuals in Europe in late 1963, thought to be
associated with the <ent type='PERSON'>John Kennedy</ent> assassination.) </p>

<p> On December 28th 1990, when <ent type='PERSON'>Gonzalez</ent> sought the records of the
<ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> branch of <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> (Case number 90 C 6863 of the U.S. District Court in
<ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>: People of the State of Illinois ex re; William C. Harris v. the
Board of Governors of <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Reserve System</ent>), <ent type='PERSON'>Gonzalez</ent> was told by
Federal Judge, <ent type='PERSON'>Brian Duff</ent> that he could not have them. <ent type='PERSON'>Duff</ent>, a friend of
both <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and Reagan, works closely with <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Reserve Bank</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Duff</ent>
impounded the documents and abused <ent type='PERSON'>Gonzalez</ent>U attorney for Rbehaving like an
800 -pound gorilla.S That is when <ent type='PERSON'>Duff</ent> impounded the records. </p>

<p> Questions abound. Suspicions arise from the fact that among
officials involved in the <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> bank is <ent type='PERSON'>Brent Scowcroft</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>Us National
Security advisor who, <ent type='PERSON'>Gonzalez</ent> has now revealed, maintained a million-dollar financial interest in 40 of the biggest U.S. weapons companies that
profited from U.S. policies toward <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>, including <ent type='ORG'>General Electric</ent>,
General Motors, <ent type='ORG'>ITT</ent>, and <ent type='ORG'>Lockheed</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Gonzalez</ent> has also revealed that
Assistant Secretary of State <ent type='PERSON'>Laurence Eagleberger</ent> worked closely with <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent>
when he and <ent type='PERSON'>Scowcroft</ent> were part of Henry <ent type='PERSON'>Kissinger</ent>Us consulting firm.
<ent type='PERSON'>Kissinger</ent> was a member of the board of <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> and his firm represents <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> in
the <ent type='GPE'>USA</ent>. </p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent>, P2 and the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican Bank</ent> </p>

<p> The <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> bank was also used for secret arms trade by the outlawed P2
<ent type='NORP'>Masonic</ent> Lodge of <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent>, whose Grandmaster, <ent type='PERSON'>Licio Gelli</ent> is thought to have
been the mastermind behind <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent>Us illegal, world-wide banking strategies,
until his arrest in 1981, for embezzling $1.5 billion from the Vatican
Bank. The <ent type='ORG'>Vatican Bank</ent> had close ties with <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Gelli</ent> was recently
sentenced to 18 years in jail for his role in the case. </p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Gelli</ent> was involved with the PopeUs banker and bodyguard, Bishop
<ent type='PERSON'>Marcinkus</ent> (formerly of <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>) in the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican Bank</ent> embezzlement. When the
<ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> government issued a warrant for the BishopUs arrest they were
blocked by the Vatican, which claims separate city-state authority. (The
Pope is still closely involved with <ent type='PERSON'>Marcinkus</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican Bank</ent> is still
closely associated with <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent>.) </p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Gelli</ent> are friends. <ent type='PERSON'>Gelli</ent> was guest of honor at the 1981
Reagan-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> inaugural ball. (N.Y. Times, June 4, 1981, page 7.) <ent type='PERSON'>Kissinger</ent>
also knew <ent type='PERSON'>Gelli</ent>. When <ent type='PERSON'>Gelli</ent> was arrested in March, 1981, <ent type='PERSON'>Kissinger</ent>
immediately sent an agent to <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> with $18000 to try to buy some of the
documents in the P2 case to keep them from becoming public ( In These
Times, Sept. 1982). It may be of interest that P2 had a lodge in <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>. </p>

<p> <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>, it is now emerging, has been the central point for vast,
international, illegal transactions involving the <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> banks and
secret deals with <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n oil companies, military manufacturers, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>,
and possibly U.S. politicians. (According to a <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> source, unreleased
<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> documents in the possession of <ent type='ORG'>the Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> list the names of
at least 105 members of U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> - of both <ent type='ORG'>Houses</ent> and both parties -
who have received money through the <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> branch of <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>. The U.S.
<ent type='ORG'>Federal Reserve</ent> is said to have a copy of the same secret <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> list). </p>

<p> The Octopus </p>

<p> Just as the P2 scandal in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> brought down the government and
destroyed hundred of careers in politics, industry and banking, so too the
<ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent>/<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> - Penzzoil case could bring down the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> administration and send
dozens of top administration officials to jail. Indeed the P2 and <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> cases
overlap in the October Surprise case, and U.S. investigators would do well
to examine the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> government documents in the P2 case as part of their
inquiry into the October Surprise/<ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent>/<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>/Penzzoil/<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>/<ent type='PERSON'>Hussein</ent> links. It
is beginning to look as though the late journalist, <ent type='PERSON'>Danny Casselaro</ent> was on
the right track at the time of his highly suspicious RsuicideS last year,
when he was investigating what he called <ent type='ORG'>RThe</ent> OctopusS, a vast,
interlocking, international criminal conspiracy. </p>

<p> Bush's Watergate </p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> is now calling for the appointment of a Special Prosecutor
to investigate the ballooning <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent>-<ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>gate case. In his insightful and
relentless reporting on the case in The <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> Times, <ent type='PERSON'>William Safire</ent> says
flatly that <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> will be <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>Us Watergate. Saffire is now investigating the
<ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> link to the case. (Updates on the case now appear regularly on the
recorded telephone hotlines of controversial <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> investigator, Sherman
Scholnick of <ent type='ORG'>the RCommittee</ent> to Clean Up the CourtsS, who has spearheaded
his own investigation. Call: 312 - 731 1100 &amp; 312-731 1505 for five-minute recorded updates.) </p>

<p> When appointed, the Special Prosecutor in the <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent>/<ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>gate case
should have immediate access to all the records, including the crucial
documents now confiscated and impounded by the <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> court. </p>

<p> When the truth of the <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> case is finally revealed, the War &amp;
Peace foundation believes we will see the extent to which politics around
the world
have been corrupted by the arms trade. <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>gate will serve as further
evidence of the need for international monitoring by <ent type='ORG'>the United</ent> Nations of
all weapons traffic as a first, essential step toward complete world
disarmament. </p>

<p> Ironically, as we go to press, joint efforts by both houses of
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> in the wake of the <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>gate revelations to tighten restrictions on
the sale of nuclear weapons-related materials to nations like <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>
and <ent type='GPE'>Syria</ent>, have provoked a threat of veto by <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent>, who argues that
such non-proliferation legislation would mean a loss of business for
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n nuclear exporters! </p>
