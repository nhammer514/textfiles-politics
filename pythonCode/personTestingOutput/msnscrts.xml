HOW TO CRASH THE FREEMASONS</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Mason</ent>ry swears its members to secrecy with grisly,
anatomically explicit oaths. A Master <ent type='ORG'>Freemason</ent> must "promise and
swear, that I will not write, print, stamp, stain, hew, cut,
carve, indent, paint, or engrave" the mysteries of his order
"under no less penalty than to have my throat cut across, my
tongue torn out by the roots, and my body buried in the rough
sands of the sea," according to one version of the oath. Tenth-degree <ent type='ORG'>Mason</ent>s "consent to have my body opened perpendicularly, and
to be exposed for eight hours in the open air, that the venomous
flies may eat my entrails" if they talk. Even the <ent type='ORG'>Shriners</ent>, a
"fun" order, may incur "the fearful penalty of having my eyeballs
pierced to the center with a three-edged blade."
Be that as it may, the secrets of the <ent type='ORG'>Mason</ent>s are preserved in
certain arcane tracts, pamphlets, and books. These are sold only
by <ent type='ORG'>Masonic</ent> supply houses -- the firms that sell fezzes, banners,
plaques, jewels, and other regalia to lodges. The supply houses
take the secrecy seriously. Most will not sell booklets containing
club secrets to anyone who cannot show a <ent type='ORG'>Masonic</ent> ID. BIG SECRETS
came across a <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> firm, however, that works by mail order. The
Geo. <ent type='PERSON'>Lauterer</ent> Corporation publishes an illustrated catalog of
lodge gear. It offers over a hundred <ent type='ORG'>Masonic</ent> and other fraternal
manuscripts. We obtained a sampling of titles.
<ent type='ORG'>American Masonry</ent> differs in certain particulars from <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>
or <ent type='ORG'>Continental Masonry</ent>. Rituals may vary from lodge to lodge.
<ent type='ORG'>Masonic</ent> tracts do not always agree. Except where noted, the
information below is taken from two of <ent type='PERSON'>Lauterer</ent>'s titles,
RICHARDSON'S MONITOR OF FREEMASONRY by a pseudonymous Benjamin
Henry Day, and INITIATION <ent type='PERSON'>STUNTS</ent> by Lieutenant <ent type='PERSON'>Beale Cormack</ent>.</p>

<p>
The Secret Handshake

It's a regular handshake, except that you press your forefinger
hard into the other's palm. The thumb presses against the base
joints of the second and third fingers. It looks pretty much like
any other handshake; only the person shaking hands can feel the
difference.</p>

<p>The Secret Password

"Tubal-Cain" is the secret password of a Master <ent type='ORG'>Mason</ent>. But some
lodges have their own passwords.</p>

<p>The Secret Word

Not to be confused with the password. The Word (always
capitalized) is so secret that initiates are taught it one letter
at a time. First they learn A, then O, then M, and finally I. The
Word is IAOM.
You never get a straight story as to what it means. As best
as anyone can figure, it is the ineffable name of God, or some
approximation thereof. The Word (or Name) is a tongue-twister. It
takes some practice to get it right. The following pronunciation
guide is from MASONRY AND ITS SYMBOLS IN THE LIGHT OF THINKING AND
DESTINY by <ent type='PERSON'>Harold Waldwin Percival</ent>:</p>

<p> The Name is pronounced as follows: It is started by
opening the lips with an "ee" sound graduating into
a broad "a" as the mouth opens wider with lips
forming an oval shape and then graduating the sound
to "o" as the lips form a circle, and again
modulating to an "m" sound as the lips close to a
point. This point resolves itself to a point within
the head.
Expressed phonetically the Name is "EE-Ah-Oh-Mmm" and is pronounced with one continuous out-breathing with a slight nasal tone in the manner
described above. It can be correct and properly
expressed with its full power only by one who has
brought his physical body to a state of
perfection...


The <ent type='ORG'>Shriners</ent>' Recognition Test

According to a <ent type='PERSON'>Lauterer</ent> manuscript, this is how two <ent type='ORG'>Shriners</ent>
recognize each other:

Q: Then I presume you are a Noble?
A: I am so accepted by all men of noble birth.
Q: Have you traveled any?
A: I have.
Q: From where to what place have you traveled?
A: Traveled east over the hot burning sands of the desert.
Q: Where were you stopped at?
A: At the devil's pass.
Q: What were you requested to do?
A: I was requested to contribute a few drops of urine.
Q: Why were you requested to do this?
A: As a token of my renouncing the wiles and evils of the world
and granted permission to worship at the Shrine.
Q: At what Shrine did you worship?
A: At the Shrine of <ent type='NORP'>Islam</ent>.
Q: Did you ride?
A: Yes, I rode a camel until I paused to dismount.
Q: Then what did you do with your camel?
A: I tied him.
Q: Where did you tie him?
A: I tied him to a date tree, where all True <ent type='ORG'>Shriners</ent> should do
so.
BOTH: Yes, I pulled the <ent type='PERSON'>Cord</ent>, rode the hump, I have traversed
the hot arid sands of the desert to find Peace and rest in
the quiet shades of the Oasis.</p>

<p>Initiation</p>

<p>There are two sides to <ent type='ORG'>Freemason</ent> initiations -- one a
standardized, sedate ritual; the other a highly variable set of
hazing stunts.
Prospective <ent type='ORG'>Mason</ent>s must apply of their own free will.
<ent type='ORG'>Mason</ent>s may not recruit friends at least not in theory. Proposed
members are investigated by a committee of lodge members. This
is often just a formality but may include, for instance, a
credit report. The committee reports on the candidate at a
lodge meeting. Members then vote.
The ballot box is the <ent type='PERSON'>Lauterer</ent> catalog uses white balls and
black cubes. (Losers are blackcubed, not blackballed.) If there
is a single negative vote, the ballot is declared foul. The
lodgemaster (who sees how each member voted) may try to
convince dissenting members to reconsider. A negative verdict
on the second ballot is final.
Successful candidates are invited to the lodge for
initiation. There are three basic degrees: Entered <ent type='ORG'>Apprentice</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'>Fellow Craft</ent>, and Master <ent type='ORG'>Mason</ent>. Each has its own ritual.
Entered <ent type='ORG'>Apprentice</ent> candidates begin by taking off their
clothes to prove their gender (women may not become <ent type='ORG'>Mason</ent>s). In
practice, this means taking off the pants and any jacket.
Underwear and shirt are kept on, but the shirt is unbuttoned
and pulled down to bare the left arm, shoulder, and breast.
The candidate is hoodwinked (blindfolded). A cabletow
(rope) is placed around the neck. (The <ent type='PERSON'>Lauterer</ent> catalog's
hoodwink is simply a standard, black satin half-face mask --
without eyeholes -- secured with an elastic string. The
cabletow is a heavy blue rayon cord with tassels at both ends.)
Ideally, the cabletow is supposed to have four strands to
symbolize the four senses (they don't count touch). The
candidate is escorted to a room where three candles are
burning. One of the lodge members takes a <ent type='ORG'>mason</ent>'s compass or
other sharp instrument and pricks the candidate's bared skin.
The candidate is instructed to recite a formula to the effect
that what he desires most is light. The other lodge members
remove his hoodwink and cabletow. Before the candidate are
three candles. He is told that the candles represent the sun,
the moon, and the master of the lodge.
The candidate gets a lecture on the symbolism of <ent type='ORG'>Mason</ent>ry.
Visual aids are used (<ent type='PERSON'>Lauterer</ent> sells a set of three lecture
charts and a set of 188 35-millimeter slides). He is given a
"lambskin," a white apron. <ent type='PERSON'>Lauterer</ent>'s lambskins are indeed
genuine lambskin, lined with cotton. They measure 13 inches by
15 inches or 14 inches by 16 inches. A triangular flap folds
down like the flap of an envelope. The lambskin is worn in
front, and a tie (tape or cord with tassels) fastens behind the
back.
A member of the lodge pretends to be a collector for a
needy cause and asks the candidate to donate. Lacking his
wallet, the candidate must refuse. The moral: Help the less
fortunate. Then the candidate is allowed to put his clothes
back on. He is taken before the master of the lodge. The master
tells him that he is now a <ent type='ORG'>Mason</ent>. The candidate is given the
working tools of the <ent type='ORG'>Apprentice</ent>, a twenty-four-inch gauge and a
gavel.
The second and third degrees follow a similar pattern. Both
repeat the business with the hoodwink and the cabletow. For the
<ent type='ORG'>Fellow Craft</ent> initiation, the right shoulder is bared, and the
cabletow is tied around the right biceps. In the Master <ent type='ORG'>Mason</ent>
initiation, the cabletow is wound around the body three times.
Each degree has its own lecture on symbolism.
Then there are the optional degrees. Their initiation
rituals take the form of short plays starring the candidate and
other lodge members. The playlets deal with incidents from the
mythic history of the <ent type='ORG'>Mason</ent>s, such as the building of King
Solomon's Temple and the murder of Temple architect Hiram
Abiff. These initiations cost the candidate about $150 a pop,
so any thirty-second-degree <ent type='ORG'>Mason</ent> has dropped over $4000. Once
a <ent type='ORG'>Mason</ent> has completed the twenty-nine optional degrees of the
<ent type='NORP'>Scottish</ent> rite or the six optional degrees of the York rite, he
is eligible to become a <ent type='ORG'>Shriner</ent> -- which means still another
initiation.
Depending on the whim of the other lodge members,
initiations may include a set of burlesque tests to prove a
candidate's mettle. These blend sophomoric practical jokes,
soft S&amp;M, an an electric carpet (the latter "just the item for
initiations," touts the <ent type='PERSON'>Lauterer</ent> catalog, at $4.75 a square
foot; jump spark battery extra). <ent type='PERSON'>Lauterer</ent>'s INITIATION <ent type='PERSON'>STUNTS</ent>
booklet describes over thirty tests judged suitable for
fraternal orders, of which the following is a sample. In all
cases, candidates are blindfolded. Here's how the <ent type='ORG'>Mason</ent>s keep
out the wimps:</p>

<p>"Chewing the Rag"
A lodge member criticizes two candidates for speaking: "They
both talk too much and I fear they will someday betray the
secrets of our brotherhood." As a lesson, the candidates must
"chew the rag." The member says that he has a six-foot length
of string with a raisin tied in the middle. Each candidate gets
an end of the string. The member instructs the candidates to
chew the string from their respective ends: The one who gets
the raisin will be excused from "The Test of the Drowning Man."
They chew. The "raisin" is really a piece of candy coated with
<ent type='ORG'>Epsom</ent> salts. There is no "Test of the Drowning Man."</p>

<p>"<ent type='NORP'>Oriental</ent> Dance"
Lodge members strip a candidate and put a skirt on him. As
<ent type='NORP'>Oriental</ent> music is played, he is forced to dance on the electric
carpet. This is one of several uses of the carpet, all of which
are deemed more effective if the candidate does not know about
the carpet. The electric-shock sensation is not immediately
identifiable as such, or so the semiwarped reasoning goes.
Members may warn the blindfolded candidate to "step high" to
avoid burning desert sands, barbed wire, or snakebites.</p>

<p>"A Trip to the <ent type='PERSON'>Moon</ent>"
A member raps his gavel and orders all to be seated. A second
member replies that there is no seat for himself and one of the
candidates. They are told to sit on the floor. They sit on a
spread blanket. As soon as the candidate is seated, the second
member steps off the blanket. The candidate is told to sing a
song. The lodge members protest his singing and demand that he
be punished. All quietly grab the ends of the blanket and toss
the candidate in the air.</p>

<p>"The <ent type='ORG'>Barber Shop</ent>"
A member feels a candidate's chin and calls for a barber. The
"barber" lathers the candidate, getting foam in his mouth. He
shaves him with what feels like a very, very rough blade. It's
a shingle.

"Boxing Match"
Two candidates are selected for a boxing match. Belts are
strapped around their waists. A six-foot rope connects the
belts so that candidates do not wander blindly off. The boxers
are given gloves. Unknown to the candidates, a member also puts
on gloves and gives them occasional jabs from unexpected
directions.</p>

<p>"Tug-of-War"
Two candidates or groups of candidates play tug-of-war. An
unseen member sets the rope afire in the middle. It burns in
two, and all fall down -- on the electric carpet, if desired.</p>

<p>"The Thirst"
"This neophyte has asked for a drink of water," a member says.
Another member replies that there is no water. "Then we must
make water," says the first. Several members urinate in a bowl,
making sure that the candidate hears. "It is ready," says a
member. "Drink, and quench thy thirst." The candidate is handed
a bowlful of warm water and forced to drink it.</p>

<p>"<ent type='PERSON'>Punkin Pie</ent>"
This is just a forced pie-eating race, with the candidates'
hands bound behind their backs. Other gustatory stunts involve
making the blindfolded candidates eat various non-and quasi-edible materials: INITIATION <ent type='PERSON'>STUNTS</ent> suggests ginger ale
containing frankfurters and toilet-paper squares.</p>

<p>"The Shampoo"
A candidate is told that he must possess three essentials to be
a member: keen vision, a sensitive touch, and an acute sense of
smell. An egg is placed in his hand. "What is in your hand?" he
is asked. The candidate replies, "An egg." "Correct. Now to
test your sense of smell -- is it a good egg or a bad egg?" The
candidate answers. "We'll see if you are correct," the member
says. He crushes an empty eggshell on the candidate's head and
pours some water on it. He rubs the "egg" in @the candidate's
hair. Another member holds a bottle of ammonia or other evil-smelling substance under the candidate's nose.

"The Trained Dog"
A candidate is told that he must meet <ent type='PERSON'>Fido</ent>, the trained dog. An
authentic dog is brought in. "<ent type='PERSON'>Fido</ent> snarls at neophytes and
sometimes bites them in the calf of the leg," a member warns.
Another pinches the candidate's leg. The dog is placed in the
candidate's lap. The initiation ceremony proceeds with another
candidate so that the first believes that attention has shifted
from him. A member sneaks up on the candidate with the dog and
trickles some warm water in his lap. He may also hold a smell
bottle under the candidate's nose. "Naughty <ent type='PERSON'>Fido</ent>!" all scold.
A variation is the "Bung Hole Test," a standard feature of
<ent type='ORG'>Shriner</ent> initiations. No dog is required. Two blindfolded
candidates are directed to opposite ends of a barrel or large
metal cylinder lying on its side. They are told to crawl into
the barrel or cylinder. The candidates bump heads in the
middle. Outside, a lodge member yelps like a dog. Someone
sprinkles warm water on the candidates' faces through a hole. A
member yells, "Get that dog out of there! It just pissed in his
face.!"</p>

<p>"The Sacred Stone"
The candidate is told that a "sacred stone" is near his feet.
He must make a sign of deference by bending over and placing
his forehead as close to the ground as possible. When the
candidate bends over, a member paddles him with a paddle
containing an exploding cartridge. "The Little Rose" test is
the same thing, only the candidate is told to pick a flower.</p>

<p>"The <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Pole"
Candidates are forced to climb a greased pole while members
paddle them. Afterward, a member hands a candidate a piece of
ice: "Here is your share of the <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Pole. Hold on to it as
long as you can, and pass it on."</p>

<p>"Molten Lead Test"
A member warns the candidate that the next test may be
dangerous if not performed carefully. Proof of a candidate's
courage and faith in the order is required, the member
explains. "Is the lead good and hot?" he asks another member.
"Yes, red hot," he replies. "If you are not a coward, you must
plunge your hands into a caldron of red-hot molten lead," the
member tells the candidate. A large pot is set before the
candidate. It contains any reasonably humane substitution for
molten lead. If the candidate refuses to put his hands in the
pot, the others force him.
