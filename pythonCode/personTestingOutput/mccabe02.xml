<p> <ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> RECORD OF THE HOLY FATHERS</p>

<p> The color chosen by <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>s is <ent type='PERSON'>White</ent>. Their flag, it is
true, <ent type='PERSON'>White</ent> and Gold, to remind us that they are Kings and need a
royal revenue of a billion a year, but that is, they say, necessary
to a ruler of the world. Their personal color-theme is white, a
flowing white cassock and a white-silk skull-cap: symbols of their
purity life and purpose and their never-ceasing efforts to keep the
world in peace and tranquillity. The vast economic organization
over which they preside, the <ent type='ORG'>Black International</ent>, takes its name
from the black-garbed clergy. For more than a hundred years after
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent> had embodied the elementary rights, of man in a
Constitution the priests called the claim of those rights in other
countries <ent type='NORP'>Liberalism</ent> and waged a bitter, blood-soaked fight against
it. This was the historic battle of the <ent type='NORP'>Blacks</ent> and the <ent type='PERSON'>White</ent>s
(<ent type='NORP'>Liberals</ent>).</p>

<p> Toward the end of the nineteenth century a new color, Red,
appeared in the arena. <ent type='PERSON'>White</ent>s and <ent type='NORP'>Blacks</ent> shuddered and got together
to oppress it. Red meant blood, violence, war. As I explained in
the last book, our folk are now educated in so false a version of
history, because truth is offensive to our <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> fellow-citizens, that few know the irony of this. Particularly in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>
men and women were persuaded to greet the new banner with hatred,
rage, and disgust. These newcomers who preached violence, cruelty,
and war were outside the pale of our <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> civilization. Shoot
the dogs down, as <ent type='PERSON'>Luther</ent> said about the rebel-peasants of his time.
Let me here just outline the historical evidence that the real
<ent type='ORG'>Reds</ent>, in this sense, are, and always have been, <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>s and their
bishops.</p>

<p> We have read hundreds of times the prophecy of the famous
<ent type='NORP'>British</ent> essayist, Lord <ent type='PERSON'>Macaulay</ent> that when in some remote age a
traveller comes from <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> to see the ruins of <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> the
<ent type='ORG'>Papacy</ent> will still flourish. These literary men! Not only does it
seem unlikely that <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> will ever support 5000000 people
but the idea that an institution which has lasted 1800 years will
last another few millennia, or even a century, is childish. In </p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p>Macaulay's time the world was beginning to perceive that
institutions which appeared thousands of years ago probably had
their roots in ignorance. There were then twenty Kings in Europe.
A century later there were ten, and most of them looked nervously
upon a hostile world. In another ten years they will probably be
reduced to one.</p>

<p> The <ent type='ORG'>Papacy</ent> is far more vulnerable than monarchy. As the
supreme head of the western half of <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent>ity it was established
about the middle of fifth century. It is quite literally what
<ent type='PERSON'>Hobbes</ent> called it, "the ghost of <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Empire</ent></ent> sitting upon the
grave thereof." As long as that <ent type='GPE'>Empire</ent> maintain civilization every
branch of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, east and west, scorned <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>'s
pretensions. But in a world of blind men the one-eyed man is king,
and <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> ruled the ruins. The <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent>s were masters of a that was so
debased that during the next seven centuries all Europe did not
produce one book that any but a bookworm now reads or raise one
building that any but an antiquarian would cross the street to
examine.</p>

<p> The brilliant civilization which the <ent type='NORP'>Arabs</ent> meantime created in
<ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Sicily</ent> at last awakened Europe from its hog-like
slumbers, and for the next eight centuries the power of <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>s
was based upon violence and bloodshed. A distinguished <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>
historian has estimated that their victims numbered more than
1000000 in 500 years. Certainly they numbered some millions.
Until the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n and <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> Revolutions these were frankly called
Heretics. Then the world, under the lead of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, decided that
it was a crime to put men to death for religion, so they were
called <ent type='NORP'>Liberals</ent>, and the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> got half a million of them
liquidated. By the twentieth century civilization generally had
become <ent type='NORP'>Liberal</ent> so they were called <ent type='ORG'>Reds</ent> or <ent type='NORP'>Bolsheviks</ent>. Very few
people are taught in school -- except in those disreputable
<ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> Schools -- that it is simply an historical truth that
their flag is "red with martyrs' blood."</p>

<p> Is it credible that the Holy Fathers, clad in the symbols of
peace and purity, were guilty of these things? I recently published
in <ent type='GPE'>England</ent> a History of <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>s (1939) in which I could pay more
attention to the characters of <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>s than in my larger True
Story of the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> (1930). Let me say shamelessly,
that I read the original authorities in <ent type='NORP'>Greek</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>Latin</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>,
<ent type='NORP'>Spanish</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>French</ent>, and no <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> has ever attempted to
answer any of my historical work. And I say, coldly, that these
Holy Fathers shed more blood in defense of their wealth and power
than all the other historic religions put together and that the
record of their vices is the worst in the whole history of
religion.</p>

<p> There have been about 260 of these Vicars of Christ, as they
call themselves. It is difficult to tell the exact number because
in certain periods there were two or three truculently fighting for
the holy title. In the tenth century there were 30 in 100 years --
there have been only six in the last 100 years -- and it is
impossible to be sure how many were murdered by rivals. Let us say
that there have been 260. We know nothing about the character of
the great majority of these during the first thousand years of the </p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p><ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> Era. <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> literature gives the title of martyr to
nearly every <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> to the year 310, though their most learned
historian, <ent type='ORG'>Duchesne</ent>, admits that only two were martyred. It gives
the title of Saint to all but one of them to the fifth century,
whereas we have definite information about only three of them, and
one of these (St. Victor) was at least shady, the second (St.
<ent type='ORG'>Callistus</ent>) was definitely a crook, and the third (St. Damasus) was
a forger, and an employer of murderous mobs and was charged under
the civil law with adultery. In short, of the 150 or so <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent>s about
whose characters we can be fairly sure at least 30 were sexually
loose men (six or seven of them sodomists) and about a dozen
murderers. Scores besides these were men of vile temper and great
cruelty; and most of them were guilty of simony, nepotism, and
protecting corruption.</p>

<p> So put out of your mind the conventional gush about "venerable
heads of the great <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>," and remember that even the best <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent>s
were terrible shedders of blood. The holiest of them all, Innocent
III, was responsible for about 500000 victims in 18 years (1198-1216). The question here is whether this is ancient stuff that
throws no light or has no bearing on the conduct of the <ent type='ORG'>Papacy</ent> in
modern times. That is what <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s say and most people believe;
but you will not understand the situation today unless you realize
that the "<ent type='ORG'>Red Record</ent>" which is the title of this chapter, mainly
refers to the record of <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>s from the fall of <ent type='PERSON'>Napoleon</ent> (1814)
to our own time.</p>

<p> I said in the last booklet that during this period about
500000 men, women, and children were done to death by the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>
and the feudal monarchs in alliance. With that disgusting meanness
to which the difficulties of their case drives them, <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
writers represent, and try to compel other writers and works of
reference to represent, these martyrs as a sort of early type of
<ent type='ORG'>Reds</ent>, or dangerous agitators against the social order as well as
religion. On the contrary they were as a rule less radical than
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Jefferson</ent>. Republicanism was rare amongst them, and
the had no idea of persecuting the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> or, even in most cases,
of disestablishing it. They were just men and women who wanted
kings to govern them constitutionally and the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> to suppress
the horrible Inquisition and its vile dungeons. For this Kings and
<ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent>s fell upon them, through the armies, police, and fanatical
mobs, with incredible savagery.</p>

<p> Do not listen to the excuse that it was still the Middle Ages.
<ent type='PERSON'>Napoleon</ent> had made an end of that horror. Some now put <ent type='PERSON'>Napoleon</ent> on
a level with our modern dictators, but with all his faults he was
a clean fighter, only in one case accused of murder (<ent type='ORG'>the Duc</ent>
d'Enghien), and he did magnificent work for Europe. He was a
skeptic, of course, as Lord <ent type='PERSON'>Rosebery</ent> shows in The Last Phase
(1900), but he showered wealth and favor upon the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> -- on the
usual terms: the priests must keep the old <ent type='NORP'>Republicans</ent> quiet for
him. Yet after his fall the bishops joined with the <ent type='NORP'>royalists</ent> in a
<ent type='PERSON'>White</ent> Terror which was more brutal than the Red Terror.</p>

<p> <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s represent <ent type='PERSON'>Pope Pius VII</ent> as a "martyr" under
<ent type='PERSON'>Napoleon</ent>. They do not tell how under this Pius VII, when <ent type='PERSON'>Napoleon</ent>
was beaten, tens of thousands of <ent type='NORP'>Liberals</ent> were martyred and under
his three successors hundreds of thousands. Well, what were these </p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p>Holy Fathers, of modern times, like, and what were they protecting?
If you want a serious and unchallengeable answer look up that
highly respectable and most weighty authority the Cambridge Modern
History (Vol. X). You will find that <ent type='PERSON'>Leo XII</ent>, who succeeded Pious
-- the Carbolic Encyclopedia admires his "intelligence and masterly
energy" -- was a converted rake and a doddering old fool who was
"hated by all, princes and beggars" (as the famous historian L. von
Ranke who knew him, said) and his death was hailed by the <ent type='NORP'>Romans</ent>
"with indecent joy" (the <ent type='NORP'>Prussian</ent> ambassador at <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> said). While
he shot birds in <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> garden his troops, with a sanguinary
cardinal in command, shot down his rebels, and many thousands of
them suffered a living death in jails of a repulsive character.</p>

<p> At his death the cardinals, after invoking the light of the
Holy Spirit, elected, to meet the grave problems of the new Europe
a man in the last stage of senile decay, drooling at the mouth as
they wheeled him round <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> garden in his baby-carriage. The
carnage of rebels went on. He soon died, and the fierce contest of
cardinals for the holy office was renewed. The ablest candidate
<ent type='PERSON'>Albani</ent>, but he was so notorious a rogue that they thought the
heretics of <ent type='GPE'>England</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Prussia</ent> might make ribald remarks if they
elected him Vicar of Christ, so they made him Secretary of State
(and real ruler of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>) and elected a monk Gregory XVI.</p>

<p> Gregory was according to all <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> historians vulgar,
sensual, and frivolous. As one of the more distinguished of them
says, he "absorbed himself in ignoble interests while the country
groaned under misrule." It was widely believed in <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> that he was
intimate with the wife of his valet, and he was notorious for his
love of strong wine and candy. His horrible jails were crammed with
rebels -- 6000 at one time -- and the best blood of <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> was
poured out or driven abroad. His ignorance was weird. He refused to
admit even gas and railways into <ent type='GPE'>the Papal</ent> States, as if that meant
that the devil got his foot in the door.</p>

<p> After fifteen years of this the cardinals elected what
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s call a <ent type='NORP'>Liberal</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent>, Pius IX. But when he found that
<ent type='NORP'>Liberals</ent> wanted real freedom and a share in reforming his corrupt
kingdom he fled in disguise and called upon the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> powers to
kill his rebels for him. Then the jails were crammed again. In
<ent type='GPE'>Civita Veechia</ent>, which had once been enlivened by the orgies of
medieval Holy Fathers, rebels with a life-sentence were chained to
the wall and not released even for relieving themselves. So the
brutality continued until the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>s bought off <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>'s <ent type='NORP'>French</ent>
protectors and took over, with an overwhelming vote of the
inhabitants, <ent type='GPE'>the Papal</ent> Kingdom.</p>

<p> What was this kingdom (<ent type='GPE'>the Papal</ent> States) which they had shed
so much blood to protect? There is no dispute amongst non-<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
historians, and some <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> historian's agree, that it was "the
most corrupt, backward, vicious, and inept in Europe." The <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>
ambassador publicly declared it "the opprobrium of Europe." The
leading monarchs of Europe in 1832 publicly warned the <ent type='ORG'>Papacy</ent> --
which is now pressed upon us as the most profound and serene oracle
on political morality -- that unless it cleaned up its <ent type='ORG'>Augaean</ent>
stable they would clean it themselves. <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> was described by a
devout <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> priest as "the most hideous sewer that was ever
opened up to the eye of man;" and this is approvingly quoted by a </p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p><ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> historian in the Cambridge Modern History (X, 164) in
which all this is admitted. The real ruler or Secretary of State,
Cardinal Antonelli, who had been born in a peasant's hut, died
worth $20000000, and left a bastard daughter, the Countess
Lambertini clamoring for it.</p>

<p> <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>the Kingdom</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Naples</ent>, was virtually an extension
of <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>'s Kingdom in respect of Papal influence; and it
rivalled <ent type='GPE'>the Papal</ent> States in corruption and viciousness. Its
monarchs, <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>'s beloved sons, were veritable <ent type='ORG'>Neros</ent>. From 1790
to 1860 they slaughtered, sometimes with revolting barbarity, about
200000 "<ent type='NORP'>Liberals</ent>." And since <ent type='ORG'>the Kings</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Portugal</ent> were
just as servile to <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>s we are entitled to bring their
misdeeds also under the heading of the "moral influence" of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent>s. Their "Butcher's bill" in 50 years was between 50000 and
100000. The savagery was so indiscriminate that no one can get
nearer to the truth.</p>

<p> Well, well, the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> says, this is still ancient history
-- less than a century ago -- and with the glorious pontificate of
<ent type='PERSON'>Leo XII</ent>I a new era was inaugurated; the era of those beautiful
encyclicals on socio-political matters which are quoted in every
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> apology that is put before the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n public. For an
understanding of the present situation it is very important to
realize that there was no change of policy whatever at <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent>.
That is why I have given this very slight outline of the bloody
history of the past, which is fully described in my earlier works.
The policy of violence was merely suspended until it could once
more be applied.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Leo XII</ent>I could not, if he wanted, maintain the vile practices
of his predecessors. <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> witnessed a rapid growth of
skepticism in high quarters after 1870 and would not tolerate Papal
interference or advice. <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent> was under <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, which treated the
<ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> as an <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> monkey. <ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent>, brought down by its defeats was
becoming very <ent type='NORP'>Liberal</ent>. The horrors of the dead <ent type='GPE'>Papal Kingdom</ent> and of
<ent type='GPE'>Naples</ent> were told by hundreds of writers and orators in Europe and
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. Moreover, the, Vatican had begun to see remarkable
possibilities of wealth in "converting", <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Great Britain</ent>,
and the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s in those countries had as yet not the least
influence on the press and education and could not have concealed
atrocities as they now do. So the wolf put on sheep's clothing for
a few years.</p>

<p> Then the menace of the <ent type='ORG'>Reds</ent> began and gave them their
opportunity. There was still only one country in which the "right
to kill", which (we saw in the last book) was solemnly reaffirmed
by <ent type='PERSON'>Leo XII</ent>I, could be made the basis of policy. <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent> was
geographically isolated and few people abroad took much notice of
it. In fact, in the last decade of the century the ruling and
wealthy classes everywhere were beginning to sniff at this Red
menace and would not inquire too closely. So in <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent> the
hierarchy, which was more intimately connected with <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> than that
of any other country, began to cooperate with the corrupt state on
the old lines. From 1895 to 1909, when <ent type='PERSON'>Ferrer</ent> was murdered and I
roused so much public attention that the policy had again to be
suspended, hundreds of rebels were shot and thousands tortured in
jail.</p>

<p> They were not "anarchists." I became an intimate friend of one
of them, Professor <ent type='PERSON'>Tarrida del Marmol</ent>, who fled to <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> and was
under sentence of death in <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>. He was a fine scholar and a
<ent type='NORP'>spanish</ent> gentleman of the best type, a man of aristocratic family.
loathed violence and was an anarchist only in the <ent type='NORP'>Tolstoian</ent> sense.
His great crime was that he was a rebel against the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>. In the
vile dungeons of <ent type='ORG'>Montjuich</ent>, where he was imprisoned, he saw what
was done. Men were fed for days on salt fish and dry bread and
refused water. Cords were tied tightly on their genitals. It was
afterwards proved that most of the "anarchist plots" were police
plots, and the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> was fully implicated. This want on under <ent type='PERSON'>Leo</ent>
XIII and Pius X, and it brings the <ent type='ORG'>Red Record</ent> of <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>s down to
our own time. It continued in the only country in the world in
which it could be continued.</p>

<p> Chapter II</p>

<p> WHO IS THIS PIUS XII?</p>

<p> The present <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> Pius XII, is hailed throughout the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
world as <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> of Peace. Cardinal Hinsley explains in his
introduction to The <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> Speaks (1940) that the beautiful motto of
his ancient and aristocratic family is (translated): "Peace is the
Fruit of Justice." Yes; <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> has said that hundreds of times,
with the accent on the word justice. <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> merely wants justice
and then he will give what is left of us peace. I am going to show
that Pius XII above any other <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> of modern times, even Pius IX,
is entitled to be called <ent type='ORG'>the Red Pore</ent>, <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> of <ent type='EVENT'>War</ent>.</p>

<p> One of the flatterers of "the venerable <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>" has called him
"the Greatest Neutral." He never has been neutral. For at least
five years he has openly called for war on <ent type='NORP'>Bolshevism</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>China</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>. Does anyone suppose that he was thinking
of ancient <ent type='GPE'>Jericho</ent> and merely wanted the priests to blow their
trumpets? He was summoning <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent>
States to war. Leaving out <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States, which was unwilling
to draw the chestnuts out of the fire for <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> and Wall Street,
in this slogan which <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent>, as Secretary of State, sent echoing
through the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> world he was shrieking for just that war on
<ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>China</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> which we have seen.</p>

<p> I am sometimes asked what <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> apologists reply to these
very serious historical and actual charges which I make. They never
reply. They forbid their people to read me, which is much easier.
But do not <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s regard that maneuver with suspicion? Listen.
The <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Truth Society of Ireland published a cheap booklet by
the <ent type='NORP'>Jesuit</ent> priest D.A. Lord with the title I Can Read Anything. It
meets the natural wish of many <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s to read both sides, and it
takes the usual line that the books they are forbidden to read are
filthy and mendacious but dangerously clever. <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> young men
and women are asked to be too sensible to "pit their minds" against
"the trained, clever, brilliant minds" of the Church's critics. And
lest the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> should ask if the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> and its 350000000
followers does not include a few equally brilliant writers to reply
the priest goes on (p. 22)</p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p> And when they [the anti-<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> writer's] are utterly
unscrupulous, as let's say, Joseph McCabe is, and will twist
any little bit of history to make a case, and pile yarn on
yarn to construct a proof, and use fable for fact and
supposition for solid argument, what chance has the average
reader against them?</p>

<p> The English <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Truth Society dare not publish this -- as
my friend Haldeman-Julitis shares the <ent type='NORP'>Jesuit</ent>s' opposition with me
I gather that the book is of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n origin -- because the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>
libel courts are the straightest in the world. In an <ent type='NORP'>Irish</ent> court I
would get as much justice as a <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>, So when folk in
<ent type='GPE'>England</ent> write to ask for the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> reply to me the officials
send them an address in <ent type='GPE'>Dublin</ent> where they can get this cowardly
little rag. Inquirers have reported this to me.</p>

<p> If anybody is unaware, which hardly seems likely, that the
present <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> has for the last five or six years used all his
influence to get <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, and <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> to make war,
respectively, on <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>China</ent>, which would mean a
world-war, he will have ample evidence later. First let us see how
this Red <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> became what he is.</p>

<p> Eugenic <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> comes of what is commonly called an ancient an
<ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> noble family which had lost its wealth but not its piety.
His father was a Papal lawyer and, as is usual in such cases, one
son was destined for the clerical career; especially as in the last
century government or military service was closed to good <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s
in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>Papacy</ent> still branding the government or the royal
family "robbers." More than four-fifths of the inhabitants of the
Papal States had voted to be transferred from Papal rule to that of
<ent type='ORG'>the Kings</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> but that meant nothing to the "<ent type='NORP'>democratic</ent>" <ent type='PERSON'>Leo</ent>
XIII. He was "the prisoner of <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent>", eliciting golden
sympathy from <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, and the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> statesmen were robbers. So
careers for <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> youths of noble birth and little money were
few in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>.</p>

<p> I do not suggest that Pius XII does not believe his theology,
as probably half the clergy do not in one degree or other. No one
is likely to know except himself what he believes. Priests hardly
ever tell each other. Zeal is no criterion, however. The <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
priesthood and hierarchy are an immense economic corporation
centered in <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> just as <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> Science is, in its official
framework, a business with headquarters in <ent type='GPE'>Boston</ent>. Naturally its
members are zealous; and the more responsibility they have (which
is won by the extent of their zeal) the more zealous they are. The
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> who imagines its <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> and his cardinals regarding money as
a mundane affair with which they have to soil their white fingers
occasionally should hear two or three priests talking about them
when they get to the second bottle.</p>

<p> Here is some interesting information about the higher clergy
of <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> which came to me a few years ago from a priest through one
intermediary, a friend of high character. When <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> obliged English
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s a few years ago by making a Saint of witty old <ent type='PERSON'>Thomas</ent>
More it sent them, to their stupefaction, a bill for $65000
(costs) and of $20000 for a little present to <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>! This
present was a gold chalice which, as the price of gold rose, would </p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p>be just a lump of pure gold worth about $50000. The ceremonies at
<ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> were a close monopoly of the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>s -- at least under
pressure they let one English priest hold a candle and charged him
$50 -- and every cardinal had his fixed price.</p>

<p> But understand that I suggest nothing whatever about the
Pope's belief or unbelief. He has a job of work, and this was his
apprenticeship for it. In college he discovered an ability for
learning languages and a special zeal for learning Canon Law, so he
was drafted into <ent type='ORG'>the Secretariat</ent> of State very soon after he became
priest, and there he would find himself on the fringe of the
mysteries of Vatican diplomacy. He also, being of noble birth,
joined and became a professor in <ent type='ORG'>The Academy</ent> of Ecclesiastics of
Noble Birth of course, the less said about that the better in
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, where one has to protect the legend that all his life --
when the great ones of the earth kissed his ring during his tours
of the world, when he occupied a gorgeous suite in <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> as
Secretary of State, and even now that he sits on the golden throne
-- his one ardent desire was that he could become a humble parish
priest amongst the poor. He is an aristocrat to his finger-tips. He
loathes democracy. He doubles <ent type='PERSON'>Leo XII</ent>I (in his crooked diplomacy)
and <ent type='PERSON'>Innocent III</ent> (who virtually founded the Inquisition).</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> made such progress in the department that at the
comparatively early age of 41 he was sent out on a very important
mission. <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> Benedict XV, who had notoriously intrigued with the
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>s and the <ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent>ns against the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>s, during the war
recollected that he was a <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> of Peace when, in 1917, it became
doubtful if the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>s would win. He then wanted to have the
world-prestige of bringing it to a close, and he sent <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> as
<ent type='PERSON'>Nuncio</ent> (ambassador) with plans of peace to <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y. <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> was
announced as <ent type='PERSON'>Nuncio</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Bavaria</ent>, but within a week he was in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>
seeing the Chancellor. He even saw the <ent type='ORG'>Kaiser</ent>, who told him to take
his plans home because he was sure to win the war. Why doesn't the
<ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> rather, he said, detach <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> from the <ent type='ORG'>Allies</ent> and link it with
<ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent>, as they are both <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> countries? Because, said
<ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent>, there is a very strong patriotic movement in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> in
favor of continuing the war led by a fiery young journalist named
Benito <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent>. The Pope's biographers say that the <ent type='ORG'>Kaiser</ent> told
<ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> to take no notice of "that scum" but to go ahead and detach
<ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> from <ent type='GPE'>England</ent>. It is a neat little picture.</p>

<p> The gaunt, grim, swarthy young <ent type='PERSON'>Nuncio</ent> next year saw the fall
of the <ent type='ORG'>Kaiser</ent> and the riots in <ent type='GPE'>Munich</ent>. He met the "mob" with simple
heroism, of course -- in <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> literature -- but the important
point is that this was the beginning of his knowledge and hatred of
the <ent type='ORG'>Reds</ent>. He remained in <ent type='GPE'>Munich</ent> until 1925, so he saw, with what
feelings he has not told us, the rise of a similar "scum" in
<ent type='GPE'>Bavaria</ent> and the comic-opera "March on <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>," when <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> made the
record run of his life -- backwards. In 1925 he was sent as <ent type='PERSON'>Nuncio</ent>
to <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>, and as this was the beginning of the best period in
recent <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> history, the five years of peace and comparative
prosperity under a <ent type='NORP'>Liberal</ent>-Socialist coalition, <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> must know
better than any man in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> that the excuse which was later made
for <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> in the world-press, the flattery under shelter of which
the <ent type='NORP'>Nazis</ent> created their formidable power, the plea that they had
saved <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y from chaos and distress, is a lie.</p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p> As part of the evidence, if evidence is required, that Pius
XII has only one aim in all his policy -- not the peace of the
world but the power of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> -- the twelve years he spent in
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y are important. He acquired a thorough knowledge of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>,
thought he speaks it (and <ent type='NORP'>French</ent>) with, a marked accent, and as far
as <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> affairs are concerned he has never been at the mercy of
bigoted And muddle-headed Vatican officials. He saw the years of
confusion after <ent type='EVENT'>the War end</ent> in a working compromise and a new
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y rising cheerfully from the ruins. Lamentable as the feud of
<ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent>s and Socialists was, it was a domestic squabble and did
not seriously disturb the national economy after 1924; and the
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> had more freedom and prestige than ever. <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent>
knows as little about economics as he does about history and
science, but at least he was intelligent enough to see, during his
four years in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>, that under a predominantly Socialist rule
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y was making all the progress that could be expected with so
crippling a debt, and it was not internal confusion but its share
in the world-slumps and the cessation of fat loans from <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> and
<ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent> from the end of 1929 that led to the comparative distress
of 1930-32 of which the <ent type='NORP'>Nazis</ent> took advantage. We shall see that
<ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> at one time (1934) in a fit of temper wrote the sharpest
condemnation of <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> that ever came from a clerical pen, He
always loathed <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> as a plebeian upstart and an apostate from
the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, even when he was compelling the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> bishops to bow
humbly before him and beg to be allowed to have a share in his
dirty work. But <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> promised to make an end of Socialism, and
that-not (outside of <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>) Communism or <ent type='NORP'>Bolshevism</ent> -- is the Big
Bad Wolf in the eyes of <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent>. Socialism has not only a
constant anti-Papal tradition, which will surprise nobody who knows
the facts I summarized in the last chapter, but to oblige its
wealthy supporters <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> has been compelled for half a
century to condemn it as immoral on the ground that private
ownership is a right based upon natural moral law.</p>

<p> It was, however, not until <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> had left <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y that the
<ent type='NORP'>Nazis</ent> showed any prospect of ever attaining power, and he regarded
them as a vulgar and disorderly rabble led by a bunch of unsavory
apostates and "pansies." Three years later he would, as Secretary
of State, compel the proud <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> hierarchy, against their very
decided will, to greet <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> as the Savior of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y and the
<ent type='PERSON'>White</ent> Hope of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, Let us remember, when we get to that
point in the next booklet, that <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> did not act from ignorance.
He was less innocent than <ent type='ORG'>Chamberlain</ent>. If he had any ability at all
-- and he has considerable ability -- he knew <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y thoroughly.
Will <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s call it a wicked suspicion if we assume that this
observer of events, who lived eight years in <ent type='GPE'>Munich</ent> and four in
<ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>, had read <ent type='PERSON'>Mein Kampf</ent>? He knew the program: the glorification
of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> race, the domination of Europe, the annexation of the
<ent type='GPE'>Ukraine</ent>, the massacre of the <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s, the annihilation of <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> -- in
a word, war on a stupendous scale. <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s do not obtrude today
his intimate knowledge of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y.</p>

<p> He was recalled to <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> in the summer of 1929 while <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y
was still cheerfully recovering and the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s cooperated
amiably with the Socialists and <ent type='NORP'>Liberals</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> had been head of
the diplomatic corps at <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>. The <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> ambassador had the real
right to that position and <ent type='GPE'>the Papal</ent> ambassador no right. But the </p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>s hated the <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> too much to let the honor fall to them. It
is another point to bear in mind about this pre-hitler <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y,
which <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> helped to ruin, that it genially tolerated a Papal
<ent type='PERSON'>Nuncio</ent> at the head of the diplomatic corps and a <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
Chancellor in the Wilhelmsstragse. <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s had never
before seen such things.</p>

<p> Pacelli's patron, the Secretary of State Cardinal <ent type='PERSON'>Gasparri</ent>,
was now 80 years old and unfit for office. He seems to have marked
out <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> as his successor, and he brought him back to the
Vatican for a few months of final training. Even <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
literature is a little confused here. <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> became Secretary of
State, which is the highest position in the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> after that of
<ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>, in February, 1930. In 1931 a gossip-paragraph appeared in
the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> press to the effect that it was expected in <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> that
the new Secretary of State was about to be dismissed and old
<ent type='PERSON'>Gasparri</ent> reinstated. Clearly the old men were conspiring against
<ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent>, but the same <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> writers who say that it was because
he was too lenient to <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> had already said that <ent type='PERSON'>Gasparri</ent> had
always been in favor of alliance with that brutal adventurer. We
will return to the point in a moment, but it will be useful first
to run a cursory eye over the ten years' activity of <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> as
Secretary of State.</p>

<p> He took up residence in the gorgeous suite of rooms, with
heavy gilt furniture and magnificent decorations, in <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent>
Palace. Just at the time when <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent>, who had in
the previous year signed the infamous compact by which (in effect)
the <ent type='ORG'>Papacy</ent> undertook to condone all Mussolini's crimes in return
for $90000000 and a royal independence, had begun to quarrel
fiercely, as crooks are apt to do, over the bargain. <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent>
smoothed out the quarrel, got <ent type='ORG'>the Duc</ent>e to bend his knees in St.
Peter's, and got <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> to have a cordial chat with him. So
<ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> was safely launched on his bloody career.</p>

<p> In the same year, 1931, <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> seized <ent type='GPE'>Manchuria</ent> and began to
debauch the <ent type='NORP'>Chinese</ent>. While all the world looked on with disgust at
the brigandage <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> accepted the overtures of <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> and the more
<ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> advanced and became a menace to half the world, the
deeper <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> made <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent>'s alliance with the callous and
unscrupulous bandits. In 1932 <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> made his supreme bid for power
and failed, and <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> then ordered the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> hierarchy to
withdraw their opposition to him so that he secured power and enter
upon his career of blood.</p>

<p> In 1934 <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> went to <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> to preside at a
<ent type='NORP'>Eucharist</ent>ic <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and saw the heads of each "Republic and their
bishops; and by a remarkable coincidence, if you can think it that,
Fascism began to sweep the country, rebels against the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> went
to jail in tens of thousands, and the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>s and <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>s in <ent type='LOC'>South</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent> entered upon their audacious plans. In the same year the
<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> Socialists of <ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent>, after their leaders visited the
<ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent>, treacherously crushed Socialism and prepared the way for
<ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>. In the same year <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> began the slaughter of <ent type='GPE'>Abyssinia</ent>
and the whole <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> made whoopee, and at the end <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>
gave the Queen of <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> as <ent type='ORG'>Empress</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Abyssinia</ent> Golden Rose, which
is the highest mark of Papal approval.</p>

which had the most open and solemn blessing of the <ent type='ORG'>Papacy</ent>, was the

campaign. In 1938 <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> annexed <ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent> with the full support of
the <ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent>n <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, which is one of the most docile to <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent>
in the world. In the same year the Sudeten <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s at one end of

<p> A remarkable ten-year record for <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> of Peace, the
Greatest Neutral, the Friend of Democracy, and the Black
International which carried out his instructions! That record we
have to examine in detail, proving it by public acts and published
utterances, and then to consider <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>'s first two years of
pontifical activity. But, as we go into detail, do not lose sight
of the fact that <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent>-Pius's ruling idea throughout is "the
extinction of <ent type='NORP'>Bolshevism</ent>" by the peaceful bombs and bayonets of the
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>s, <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>s, <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese; to which, in furtherance of the work
of peace, he now wants to add the bombs and bayonets of <ent type='GPE'>Vichy</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>France</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Franco</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, Salazar <ent type='GPE'>Portugal</ent>, and <ent type='ORG'>Horthy</ent> Hungary.</p>

<p> Chapter III</p>

<p> HIS GLORIOUS ALLY MUSSOLINI</p>

<p> It was on March 12, 1939, that <ent type='PERSON'>Eugenio</ent> reached the summit of
ambition and was crowned in St. Peter's. Next day a man who lived
on the frontier of <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> sent to the most respected
newspaper in <ent type='GPE'>Great Britain</ent>, the Manchester Guardian, a letter which
it -- and probably it alone of the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> or <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n press -- had
the courage to publish. The writer reminded people that March 12th
was also the last day for <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s to remain in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>. He described
from personal observation the appalling sufferings of the 70000
<ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s who, robbed of their goods, were racing for frontiers which to
a large extent were sealed against them. He saw old men, women, and
children panting up the <ent type='ORG'>Alpine</ent> slopes to <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> and says that the
<ent type='ORG'>carabineri</ent> and frontier-troops had "orders to facilitate their
migration if necessary with the help of a bayonet." He saw elderly
folks "collapse on the way up the vast acres of the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> slope";
little children "stagger, their feet bleeding, into the frontier
villages"; women try to throw themselves under the traffic when the
<ent type='NORP'>French</ent> at last put up the barriers; babies abandoned or lost by the
wayside.</p>

<p> This had gone on for a week and it was continuing in a last
frantic rush of the robbed <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s while the bells of St. Peter's and
all the churches in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> rang out joyously over the sunny land.
What did <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> of Peace do? The writer of the letter says that
the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> carabinieri and soldiers were so moved that they forgot
their instructions about the bayonet and carried children tenderly
to the frontier. What did <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> do? Nothing: except receive the
splendid congratulations of <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> and his ministers. <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
biographers boast that during the week which followed his
coronation <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent>-Pius, sinking under the burden of work, slept
only three hours every night. Very heroic, but a little puzzling,
because as Secretary of State he had been doing just that work for </p>

<p>ten years. Why the arrears? But what did he do for the <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s, for
crushed and bleeding <ent type='NORP'>democrats</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, for the heart-broken and
suffering <ent type='NORP'>Czechs</ent>? Nothing, just nothing.</p>

<p> The <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> problem had, as I said, been the first to engage
<ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> when he became Secretary of State. I have told elsewhere
(Little Blue Book No. 1501 and <ent type='ORG'>ABC</ent> Library No. 2) the story of the
rise of Fascism and its early relation to the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, In 1917
<ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> and his cut-throats were, as the <ent type='ORG'>Kaiser</ent> had said, "scum."
They were atheists, <ent type='NORP'>republicans</ent>, and gangsters until 1921. Then, to
the surprise of many, <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> asked Cardinal Ratti for permission
for <ent type='ORG'>the Black Shirts</ent> to make a solemn procession to the tomb of the
Unknown <ent type='EVENT'>War</ent>rior in <ent type='GPE'>Milan</ent> Cathedral and the cardinal gladly accepted
and gave them a place of honor," says the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Teeling (p.
106). Next year was the march on <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> (with <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> 100 miles
away), and <ent type='ORG'>the Duc</ent>e pompously declared St. Peter's and all church
property under his special protection and ordered a thanksgiving
service with the King in attendance, At one of the principle
churches of <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> for the salvation of <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>. From <ent type='PERSON'>Scum</ent> to Savior of
his Country in two years!</p>

<p> There is no secret about it. It is one of the most painful
features of the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n literature of the subject that the
respected head of a great university, <ent type='PERSON'>Nicholas Murray Butler</ent>, dupe
of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s, lent his pen (Looking Forward) in that
glorification of <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> which was as useful as a smoke-screen to
the <ent type='NORP'>Fascists</ent> while they prepared for war, Professor <ent type='PERSON'>Salvemini</ent>
(Under the Axe of Fascism, 1936) has given Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Butler</ent> a
chastisement such as few scholars ever give each other for his
gullibility in accepting <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> lies about the "confusion and
ruin" caused by the <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent>s from which <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> saved <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>.
The author Selde's shows that <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> later confessed that he
invented the <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> boogie to help the loan he had floated in
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. The danger was Socialism which was conquering <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, and
so politicians, <ent type='NORP'>royalists</ent>, generals, and industrialists put
<ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> in the saddle, after fumigating him of his atheism and
republicanism.</p>

<p> But in spite of this powerful support of throne, army, and
capital the seat in the saddle remained very insecure for seven
years. <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> had not dared to extinguish the democracy for
which <ent type='NORP'>italians</ent> had fought so nobly from 1790 to 1870. <ent type='NORP'>Liberals</ent> and
Socialists were powerfully organized and, as in <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, commanded
the majority of the votes in the cities, where the most intelligent
and the best-informed of the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>s lived. When, in 1924,
<ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> was believed to have had the most respected leader of the
Socialists, <ent type='ORG'>Matteotti</ent>, removed by murder -- his public utterances
on the murder were so gross and callous that his guilt seemed clear
-- so many turned against him that at the elections of 1926 his
power was ominously shaken. He needed just one element to turn the
scale in his favor.</p>

<p> The peasants and a certain number of the urban workers were
organized in a powerful <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Democratic movement. The <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> had,
as in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y and <ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent>, allowed this bastard Socialism to grow
up under their eyes as one way to cheek the loss of so many
millions to the Socialists and <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent>s. These <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> <ent type='NORP'>democrats</ent></p>

<p>fought the <ent type='NORP'>Fascists</ent> as truculently as the <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent>s did and while
they equally detested the Socialists and <ent type='NORP'>Liberals</ent> and would not
cooperate with them, they at least represented further millions in
opposition to <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent>.</p>

<p> As <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> was in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y during these years we do not suppose
that he had much to do with Vatican policy in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> and will
dismiss events with a brief notice. Both sides, <ent type='NORP'>Blacks</ent>hirts and
<ent type='ORG'>Black International</ent>, saw that they must sooner or later enter into
alliance against Socialism, and Mussolini's backers, the throne,
army, and capital, insisted on it. <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> on his side sacrificed
his convictions and restrained his anti-Papal followers with all
the ease of an adventurer. He, as I said, ordered a superb
thanksgiving service in church for his accession to power and
presented a very valuable, old library to <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent>. He then
complained to <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> about ending the conduct of the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
<ent type='NORP'>democrats</ent> under the priest <ent type='PERSON'>Sturzo</ent>. The priest disappeared because
of obscure <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> threats of reprisals against the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Selde</ent>s
says (<ent type='ORG'>The Vatican</ent>, p. 331) and the party was weakened. But the
opposition went on and <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> made little progress. <ent type='ORG'>The Vatican</ent>
knew the strength of its hand and wanted a price that <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent>
feared his followers would never agree to pay.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Selde</ent>s says that the revelation of <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>'s prestige in
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent> the Chicago <ent type='NORP'>Eucharist</ent>ic <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> in 1926 at length stirred
<ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> to bold action. It was more probably the menace of
<ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> elections. Secret negotiations began at that time but the
Pope's terms were so exorbitant that they dragged out for two
years. In 1926 Farinacei, Mussolini's bulldog and leader of the
anti-clerical Old Guard of the <ent type='NORP'>Fascists</ent>, publicly declared that the
alliance was necessary. <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent>, he said -- <ent type='PERSON'>Selde</ent>s gives his
words -- was ready to deal with <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> "in return for the moral
support of <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> for his policy." What the policy was" every
child knew -- the final extinction of liberty in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> and, as a
minimum, the recovery of <ent type='ORG'>Savoy</ent> and Corsica from <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Malta</ent> from
<ent type='GPE'>England</ent>, Dalmatia from <ent type='GPE'>Yugo</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Slavia</ent> -- and, instead of talking about
peaceful recovery by negotiation <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> was thundering about his
millions of bayonets whenever he opened his elegant mouth.</p>

<p> In 1928 the <ent type='NORP'>Maltese</ent> got up a kind of revolt against <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>.
There was a trial of strength between the civil and the clerical
authorities, and the Premier, Lord <ent type='PERSON'>Strickland</ent>, though a <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>,
bitterly resented the interference of the clergy in the elections.
It was proved that they even used the confessional to intimidate
voters. <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> watched with great interest, and, when the
<ent type='NORP'>British</ent> Government in the end began its historic policy of
appeasement and <ent type='PERSON'>Strickland</ent> was sacrificed, <ent type='ORG'>the Duc</ent>e had a new proof
of the utility of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>. A high <ent type='NORP'>Anglican</ent> official in <ent type='GPE'>Malta</ent> at
the time informed me, privately, that the Governor of the island,
who let, down <ent type='PERSON'>Strickland</ent>, was "grossly deceived by <ent type='GPE'>the Papal</ent>
Delegate, Msgr. <ent type='PERSON'>Pascal Robinson</ent>"; and he added "more mischief-making in <ent type='GPE'>Dublin</ent>." The <ent type='ORG'>Black International</ent> won first blood for
<ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent>.</p>

<p> So <ent type='NORP'>Fascists</ent> had to swallow the condition's, and in 1929 the
<ent type='NORP'>Blacks</ent>hirts and the Blackmailer signed their compact. The <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> got
nearly $100000000, the independence and sovereignty of the
<ent type='GPE'>Vatican City</ent>, the control of all <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> education except in the </p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p>universities, and the enforcement of the Canon Law, the
establishment of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> and endowment of the priests. The <ent type='NORP'>Duce</ent>
got a hand for the complete destruction of democracy in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> and
the silence of <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> while he murdered <ent type='NORP'>democrats</ent> and get out on
his glorious campaign to make <ent type='GPE'>Empire</ent> by selecting weak countries
for aggression.</p>

<p> This was the year of Pacelli's return to <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent>, but his
biographers are not lavish with detail at this point and do not
enable us to say definitely -- and I refuse to go on suspicions --
what, if any, share he had in this sordid business. I have to
recall it, as briefly as possible, because it was the first great
triumph of the <ent type='ORG'>Black International</ent> in our time, and it was one of
the most important steps in the advance of the brigands toward the
realization of their, plot. It finally established the power of
<ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent>. It caused <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> papers and writers (and sympathizers
like Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Nicholas Murray Butler</ent>) to take the lead in that praise of
Fascism in <ent type='GPE'>italy</ent> -- had not <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> blessed it? -- which was of
the greatest importance to the brigands in preparing their
armaments. And it gave Mussolini's imitator in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y the idea
that after all it would pay to come to terms, hypocritically, with
the <ent type='ORG'>Black International</ent>.</p>

<p> But, whatever share <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> may have had in drafting the
treaty of alliance with <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent>, he had a full share in securing
that the alliance was not wrecked. The <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> Party was still so
bitterly anti-Papal that <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> had, in soothing his followers,
to use language which <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> angrily described (in the
<ent type='PERSON'>Osservatore</ent>, May 30) as "heretical, and worse than heretical."
<ent type='NORP'>Blacks</ent>hirts in <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> and the country insulted the priests and the
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>. The <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> spoke publicly of the possibility that he would
repudiate the Treaty, and in that case, he said, "<ent type='GPE'>Vatican City</ent>
itself would fall together with the state that is dependent on
<ent type='GPE'>Vatican City</ent> for its being" (same letter in the <ent type='PERSON'>Osservatore</ent>). The
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> world and the world-press were alarmed. If <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> fell,
they said, Socialism would capture <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>. As Cardinal Hinsley, head
of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>, said at a later date, Fascism was "in
many respects unjust" but it "Prevented worse injustice -- if it
goes under, God's cause goes with it." (<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Times, October
18th, 1935). God's cause is, in the mouth of a cardinal, the power
of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>: and the end justifies the means.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> to the rescue. Old <ent type='PERSON'>Gasparri</ent>, who was stirring <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>
to resist, was pushed aside, and the <ent type='GPE'>Saint George</ent> -- who wanted to
save the world -- the world of wealth and privilege -- from the
Dragon, Socialism donned his shining armor. Friction continued, of
course. Most of the leading <ent type='NORP'>Blacks</ent>hirts hated <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>, and the
<ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> and his new Secretary of State heartily hated them. But the
alliance was indispensable. <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> now roared like any sucking
dove about the beauty of religion. "I wish to see religion
everywhere in the country," he said; "let us teach the children
their catechism" (Manchester Guardian, June 19, 1931). He, as I
said, publicly prayed in St. Peter's. Cardinal <ent type='PERSON'>Gasparri</ent> at the
<ent type='NORP'>Eucharist</ent>ic <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> of 1932 hailed him as "the man who first saw
clearly in the present world chaos" the man who is "getting the </p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p>State to work in accordance with the moral law of God" (<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
Herald, September 16 1932). The, friction was reduced and the world
was officially assured that the last <ent type='ORG'>Census</ent> had proved that 99
percent of the, <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>s were <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s.</p>

<p> It was an insincere alliance. The organization of lay dupes
known as <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Action now gave <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> trouble. He demanded
that <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> check it, and something seems to have been done, but
secretly <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> got the pope to write glowing praise of the
international <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Action and knowing that in spite of the
sacred independence of <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> City Mussolini's spies watched
it closely he sent the document by two priests to <ent type='GPE'>Paris</ent> for
publication. The old trickery of Vatican diplomacy was cultivated.
When, as in the case of the annexation of <ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent>, local prelates,
who would not dare to stir a finger against Papal policy, acted in
support of the <ent type='ORG'>Axis</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> Radio would announce to the world
that <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> disapproved. When this angered <ent type='ORG'>Axis</ent> supporters they
were assured that the radio message was unauthorized and sent out
without consulting <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent>. Sometimes <ent type='GPE'>the Papal</ent> newspaper, the
<ent type='PERSON'>Osservatore</ent>, was used and, to please both sides, was then declared
unauthorized. Neither the Radio nor the <ent type='PERSON'>Osservatore</ent> would dare to
send out or print an unauthorized message on an important point.
Foreign correspondents in <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> received telephone messages from the
Vatican which were later declared unauthorized. Ambiguous
utterances, as in the case of <ent type='GPE'>Abyssinia</ent>, were put into the mouth of
<ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>, and <ent type='ORG'>Axis</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s were encouraged to read them one way
and <ent type='NORP'>democratic</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s to read them in the opposite way. And
every <ent type='LOC'>East</ent>er and Christmas the beautiful message of Peace rolled
out, while between those festivals the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> world was inspired
everywhere to demand war on <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>China</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>.</p>

<p> There was another aspect of the alliance. While Cardinal
<ent type='PERSON'>Gasparri</ent> assured the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> world that <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> was "getting the
state to work in accordance with the moral law of God" and Cardinal
Hinsley was warning it that "God's cause" would be lost in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> if
<ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> fell, it was open to anybody to ascertain what social
improvement, if any, <ent type='ORG'>the Duc</ent>e had actually accomplished. Reference
books like the Statesman's Year Book which were in every good
library gave year by year the official <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> returns of crime,
education, production, trade, debt, etc.</p>

<p> It is astonishing today to reflect how very few people thought
of testing in this simple and positive way what truth there was in
almost universal press admiration of the efficiency and national
service of Fascism. It must, at least, seem astonishing to any man
who does not accept my suggestion that Mussolini's work in crushing
a great Socialist movement was so appreciated in the world-press
that it would not inquire whether his boast of efficiency was true
or not. It reproduced everything that its correspondents in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>,
generally, <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s, cared to send it about finer rail-services
(on some lines), new buildings, great farms on reclaimed land, and
so on, and it refused to see in works of reference, which were at
every editor's elbow that production was decaying and the internal
debt (chiefly due to forced loans) was increasing at so formidable
a rate that bankruptcy loomed ahead -- unless <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> brought
off, and brought off successfully, the aggressive war he promised
his people, and founded an <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Empire</ent> by murdering and looting
other peoples.</p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p> On the religious side it was worse. The only definite test
weather a nation is or is not getting more in accord with "the
moral law of God" is to examine its criminal statistics. In the
Papal States, before <ent type='GPE'>the Kingdom</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> had been established,
there had been no statistics of any sort, but not a single
authority questions the statement of contemporary <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> statesmen
and foreign visitors that crime and corruption were appalling.
<ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> then, from 1870 onward, had a very fair success in reducing
crime, though the success was not nearly so great as in less-<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> countries. But from the time of the accession to power of
<ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> crime increased amazingly. Convictions rose from about
500000 a year in the period which Dr. Nicholas Murrak <ent type='PERSON'>Butler</ent>
describes so darkly, the Socialist-<ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Liberal</ent> period (before
1923), to 800000 a year in the period of Mussolini's remarkable
efficiency.</p>

<p> It makes it rather worse that this was due to some extent to
the poverty and distress he had brought upon both the workers and
the middle class while the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, as I said, got an enormous
accession of wealth. Other causes were the impoverishment and
prostitution of education and the preparation of the people for the
wanton bloodshed of aggressive war. It was at the very time when
<ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent>, the future <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> of Peace, was bringing <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> and the
<ent type='NORP'>Duce</ent> to have a cordial meeting in <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> that <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> was
writing the most official statement of the nature of Fascism for
the new Encyclopedia <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>a (article, "Fascism")</p>

<p> When Fascism looks to the future, the general development
of humanity, apart from considerations of present polities, it
rejects the idea that perpetual peace is either possible or
desirable. It repudiates <ent type='ORG'>Pacifism</ent>, which means a renunciation
of struggle, a refusal to make sacrifices, <ent type='EVENT'>War</ent> alone raises
the energy of man to the highest pitch and impresses a seal of
nobility upon the nations which have the manliness to
undertake it. All other trials of strength are substitutes
which never prove a man's worth by confronting him with the
alternative of life and death.</p>

<p> That was taught to every child in every school in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>.
Didn't <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> know it? Are we supposed to find documentary
proof that <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> knew what was going on in every part of
<ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>?</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> had come from <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y where he had seen Socialism as
a mighty power already in control of more than one-third of the
country, dreaded by the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> hierarchy because, though the
Social Democrats now worked with the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s, they drew millions
from the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, dreaded by imperialists, militarists,
industrialists, and landowners. He came to <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> where he saw how
just such a powerful Socialist organization had been completely
destroyed as it was from 1928 onward by just such a coalition of
<ent type='NORP'>royalists</ent>, industrialists, militarists, and landowners taking up a
brutal spearhead resembling the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Nazis</ent>m and consolidating its
position by an alliance with the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> just as in the good old
days of the early nineteenth, century. His grand idea, war on
Socialism, gradually took shape. How in its interest he kept the
<ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> silent and the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> wildly patriotic when <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent>
began his imperial brigandage in <ent type='GPE'>Abyssinia</ent> we shall see later.
Other problems meantime confronted him and the <ent type='ORG'>Black International</ent>.

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p> Chapter IV</p>

<p> HIS DEAR YELLOW BROTHER IN BUDDHA</p>

<p> the year 1899 the <ent type='NORP'>democratic</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Leo XII</ent>I had made the ears
of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Catholic's burn. Their apologists and prelates had
begun to put before the public that conception of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> of
<ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> as the devoted ally of democracy and freedom with which we
have grown very familiar in recent years. <ent type='PERSON'>Leo</ent> smote them hip and
thigh. That was "<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>nism" not sound <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>ism. The arch-bishops writhed but were silent. <ent type='PERSON'>Leo</ent> was not very far from death,
and "from that time to this no <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> has spoken out." So says the
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Teeling, and he adds: "The reason would seem to have been
that <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> has provided an ever-increasing supply of funds and an
ever increasing supply of missionaries." (The <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> in Polities, p.
150). Certainly a golden reason; though why, on <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
principles, a particular version of <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>ism not backed by gold
Should be so humiliatingly denounced and then tolerated when it was
gold is not clear. If I assigned that reason for <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent>'s
change of policy in regard to <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> propaganda I would
be angrily accused of wicked suspicions and suggestions where I
could not give positive evidence.</p>

<p> But <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> only changed its tactics not its policy. Pius
XI, says Teeling, was particularly zealous to bring the oriental
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>es into his fold -- "so that the growth of <ent type='NORP'>democratic</ent>
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>ism in <ent type='EVENT'>the New World</ent> be counter-balanced." At <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent>,
he says (p. 3), "Western influence is not considered very good for
the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>." That we shall see, is one reason why, <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> was
encouraged in the rape of <ent type='GPE'>Abyssinia</ent> and his design of becoming
Emperor of the <ent type='LOC'>East</ent>, why <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> flirted for years with <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>,
and why it approved the savage aggression against <ent type='GPE'>Yugo</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Slavia</ent> and
<ent type='GPE'>Greece</ent>. To sustain this policy the Secretary of State had to do
some very neat tight-rope balancing. For <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> opinion, in spite
of all the "<ent type='ORG'>Lords</ent>" and aristocrats the <ent type='NORP'>Jesuit</ent>s have captured, he
seems not to have cared much. If for once I cared to indulge in a
conjecture I should say that he detests <ent type='GPE'>England</ent>. Whether that is
connected with his chilly experiences when he was sent to represent
the <ent type='ORG'>Papacy</ent> at the coronation of George V or whether he sees through
the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> pretense that they are "converting <ent type='GPE'>England</ent>" I don't
know, but Teeling, who made a number of visits to <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent>, says that
after <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> became secretary of State English <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s found a
reception at <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> and could with difficulty get an audience
with <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>. They were told to see <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent>, and they discovered
that they were "not popular," though doubtless they left the
customary purse with <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent>.</p>

<p> But <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>ism was a very different matter. It
claimed 20000000 members and said that it would have the majority
in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> by the end of the century. Its wealth is already in the
billions of dollars; its annual income $800000000. Imagine
Pacelli's eyes rolling as he turned these sum's into <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> lire!
In 1936 he visited <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, Did he encourage the efforts as
described by <ent type='PERSON'>Selde</ent>s, of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s, in cooperation with
<ent type='NORP'>Mexican</ent> refugee priests, to get an alliance with Wall Street in
order to secure the liquidation of <ent type='NORP'>Bolshevism</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>? Had he any
meetings with the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> plotters in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>? Did he </p>

<p>harden that feeling against <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> which <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y counted as one of
its favorable conditions? But we must not be suspicious. There is
no Proof. We know one thing that he did do. Instead of rebuking the
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n propagandists who represented the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> as spontaneously
<ent type='NORP'>democratic</ent> and a lover of freedom and peace he went out of his way
everywhere to leave the impression that he cordially admired the
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n spirit of freedom and democracy. He certainly did not
mention that <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> policy was to augment the oriental
elements in the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> so as to counter-balance "western influence"
which was "not considered very good for the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, in the mild
language of a <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> writer. And he certainly did not call the
attention of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns to the fact that <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> had entered
into a close alliance with <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>.</p>

<p> This alliance with <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> ran the usual course in <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
literature. At first it was indignantly denied. Where was the
proof? When the <ent type='PERSON'>Osservatore</ent> itself proudly announced on May 5,
1935, that <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> was to send an ambassador to <ent type='GPE'>Tokyo</ent> and that
<ent type='GPE'>Tokyo</ent> was to appoint a representative at <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>'s court in
<ent type='GPE'>Vatican City</ent> a new note was struck. It was <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>'s duty to enter
into negotiation with any government to protect the spiritual
interests of <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s under that government. Had not even <ent type='GPE'>England</ent>
sent a representative to <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>'s court? Yes: but "poor rich
powerful <ent type='GPE'>England</ent>" as Ambassador <ent type='PERSON'>Dodd</ent> called it, was up to its eyes
in a policy of appeasement, while in 1936 <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> had started on its
full career of aggression and of the massacre, debauching, and
exploiting of hundreds of millions of weaker folk. That is some
difference. And when, in the spring of 1941, <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent>-Plus had a
most cordial interview with that other Man of Peace <ent type='ORG'>Matsuoka</ent>, the
most brazen liar in a world of fluent liars, in <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> and,
just when <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> was plotting to take advantage of the heavy burden
of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent> to defy them by worse aggression and more
insolent outrages than ever, <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> smilingly presented him with
a gold medal . . .</p>

<p> The story of the <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese share in the world-crime is now
fairly well known -- see <ent type='ORG'>ABC</ent> Library No. 6 -- and cannot be
repeated here. All the world has seen its steady aggression for ten
years, and all the world ought to have known from the start that
<ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> meant to conquer the whole eastern half of <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent> and all
islands in the <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent>. That the truth of this depends upon the
disputed authenticity of some memoir by Baron <ent type='PERSON'>Tanaka</ent> in the year
1927 is nonsense. I have described, largely from <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n
journalists and authors (like Upton Close's Challenge. 1933), the
very open growth of the plot since the later years of the last
century. <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> was in fact so well aware of it that it alone of
the democracies began years ago to take defensive naval measures,
but there was, under the usual trade-interests, a lamentable lack
of warning in the <ent type='ORG'>Press</ent> an almost general failure to see that
Japan's were part of a world-plot and in this case a very
mischievous appeasement-policy in religious periodicals on account
of Japan's threats to the <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> missions.</p>

criminals, the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n and European encouragement of modernization

<p>elements into the army, politics, and journalism), and the
successful wars of <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> on easy victims like <ent type='GPE'>China</ent> (1895) and
Tsarist <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> (1904) gave the yellow men inflated ideas of their
ability and importance. <ent type='ORG'>The Black Dragon Society</ent>, which wanted the
conquest of north-eastern <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>, was founded in 1901 and inspired
aggressive fanaticism in naval and military circles. Advantage was
taken of the European <ent type='EVENT'>War</ent> of 1914-18 to get a strangle-hold on
<ent type='GPE'>China</ent> but a terrible earthquake and the quick recovery of the
<ent type='ORG'>Allies</ent> checked the ambition, though propaganda continued. By 1931
there were patriotic societies enthusiastically preaching it and
running to two or three million members. General <ent type='PERSON'>Hayashi</ent>, who had
led the invasion of <ent type='GPE'>Manchuria</ent> in defiance of the civil government,
said in a speech to foreign correspondents; at the close of the
campaign:</p>

<p> Japan's desire for expansion on the <ent type='LOC'>East</ent>ern <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>tic
Continent manifested in her <ent type='GPE'>Manchuria</ent>n police has been her
unalterable policy since her foundation.</p>

<p> The development of the gangrene differed little from the
development in Europe. In <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> the army and navy were the nucleus
and source of infection. The score of rich families which mainly
represented capitalism were easily persuaded to see that it was the
destiny of the <ent type='ORG'>Yamato</ent> race to extend its culture to (or exploit)
<ent type='GPE'>China</ent>. The Emperor hardly needed persuading that soldiers know
best. The politicians and the heads of the <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Shinto</ent>
religions were bought. For the quite open share of these religions
and their sudden enrichment by the imperialist brigands see the
speeches at <ent type='ORG'>the Chicago International Conference</ent> on Religion in
1934 (edited by A.E. Haydon, Moderit World-Trends in Religion).</p>

<p> The occupation of <ent type='GPE'>Manchuria</ent> in 1931 was the first step in the
realization of what would prove to be a plot of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y and <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>
to control and exploit the world: a crime which in future history
dwarf every other crime that was ever committed or attempted. The
world now pays a ghastly price for the obscene squabbling of trade-interests which prevented the destruction of the plot at this early
stage by an economic ostracism of <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>, but few people still seem
to understand that the <ent type='ORG'>Black International</ent> at once moved to the
support of the aggressor.</p>

<p> This is no matter of "suspicion." It was done quietly and in
such a form that it could, if the world's attention was drawn to
it, be represented as an inevitable exercise of <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent>'s
religious functions. It was first disclosed, as far as I can trace,
in an article by a <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> priest in the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Review des Deux
Mondes in 1935 (January 15). The negotiations which were then going
on at <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> for mutual ambassadors with <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> made it clear
that some years of cordial cooperation had preceded; and in any
case the <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> had played as sordid a part in the matter as the
<ent type='ORG'>Black International</ent> and they were disposed to boast about it.</p>

<p> The facts are now so well known that <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> writers like
Teeling discuss them freely. It appears that <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> had
approached <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>, seeking favored-nation treatment, in 1922, but
the <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent> authorities, already brought (or bought) to the
convention that <ent type='EVENT'>the Yellow Race</ent> would sweep all <ent type='PERSON'>White</ent> influence out</p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p>of eastern <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>, successfully resisted the application. <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent>
monks might take that view but <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese statesmen knew that the
<ent type='PERSON'>White</ent> Race was not to be turned down too openly until the plot was
far advanced. It was to be duped by smooth assurances that it would
have its share in a regenerated <ent type='GPE'>China</ent> and its enormously increased
capacity for consumption. It was particularly necessary to do this
after the first rape of <ent type='GPE'>China</ent>, so <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> got its opportunity.</p>

<p> The <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> clerical writer says:</p>

<p> "A short time after it had given birth to the new state
of <ent type='GPE'>Manchukuo</ent> the <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese government advised its ward to turn
to the Holy See with a request that it should be officially
recognized; an event of some importance seeing that the <ent type='ORG'>Powers</ent>
refused to recognize it and <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> had left <ent type='ORG'>the League</ent> of
Nations. These <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese-<ent type='GPE'>Manchukuo</ent>an overtures did not secure
formal recognition but, as the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> missions in <ent type='GPE'>Manchukuo</ent>
supported them <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> appointed a <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> Vicar Apostolic
to negotiate with the government of <ent type='GPE'>Manchuktio</ent> about religious
affairs." (p. 297).</p>

<p> He further explains that it was the <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> missionaries in
<ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> who persuaded the <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese government to approach the
Vatican. <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> was at the time, for reasons which will be given
later, working very amiably with <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent>, and <ent type='NORP'>French</ent>
missionaries would not be ignorant of the golden rule that trade
and the evangelization of the heathen go together. <ent type='ORG'>The Vatican</ent> was
to get a monopoly of missionary work in <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>China</ent>, which it
fully expected to be taken over by <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> (Teeling), and <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>
would be rewarded with trade.</p>

<p> It was a nice problem for <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent>, the new Secretary of State,
and he solved it in his characteristic manner. Formally to
recognize the annexation of <ent type='GPE'>Manchuria</ent> just when merely secular
governments all over the world were condemning it as an outrage and
a danger to the peace was out of the question. Even the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n
apologist would hardly be able to explain away that. So <ent type='GPE'>the Papal</ent>
organ announced quietly, as a matter of routine, that a Vicar
Apostolic had been set up in <ent type='GPE'>Manchukuo</ent> at the request of its
government. That was for the Japs a sufficiently clear recognition
of that government by <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> as a sovereign power. Does any
man suppose that the <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese statesmen and military leaders nearly
all of whom are skeptics, cared the toss of a coin about the
spiritual interests or the immortal souls of the <ent type='GPE'>Manchuria</ent>n
peasants? Or that <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> supposed they did? The brutalized
condition to which the Japs soon reduced the natives is answer
enough.</p>

<p> The <ent type='NORP'>Chinese</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Shanghai</ent> sent me copies of bitter complaints of
the Protestant missionaries in <ent type='GPE'>China</ent> about the way in which the
Japs were persecuting them in favor of <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> missionaries, but
a more important feature of the matter is that from that time the
<ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> damped down in the whole <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> world all criticism of his
dear <ent type='PERSON'>Yellow Brother</ent> in <ent type='PERSON'>Buddha</ent>. By 1934, the clerical writer in
<ent type='ORG'>Revue des Deux Mondes</ent> said, the cordial relations of the two had
gone so far that "no <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese prince or mission now passes through
<ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> without paying its homage to the Sovereign Pontiff." And to </p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent>, of course, who was now in prayerful communication with
<ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent>. Again, does anyone suppose that <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese diplomats and
princes called upon <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent> to thank him for caring for the
immortal souls, in which they did not believe, of <ent type='GPE'>Manchuria</ent>n
peasants?</p>

<p> But the alliance was brought into full light in 1935 when the
<ent type='PERSON'>Obsservatore</ent> announced the proposal of an exchange of ambassadors.
There seems to have been some hard bargaining, but in 1936 a <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent>
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> prelate appeared, incongruously enough, at the Mikado's
court and a yellow man in <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> City. By this time the
<ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese pretense of merely wishing to civilize <ent type='GPE'>Manchuria</ent> was a
mockery. It had now advanced far into <ent type='GPE'>China</ent>, having taken <ent type='GPE'>Jehol</ent> in
1933 and broken through the Great Wall in 1935. The mask was
cynically thrown aside just when the diplomatic relations with the
Vatican were put on the most respectable footing. By the customary
<ent type='ORG'>Axis</ent> method of brazen lying excuses for further aggression upon the
weak <ent type='NORP'>Chinese</ent> were invented, the "incident" was conducted with
appalling outrages, and a trail of misery and demoralization spread
in the wake of the <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese armies. <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> was now as deadly a
menace to civilization as <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y and <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, and the bland lies
with which it met every inquiry were nauseating.</p>

<p> During these years very little was said in the world-press
about this beautiful friendship of the supreme head of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>
of <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> and the supreme head of the degenerate <ent type='ORG'>Shinto</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent>
religions. <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s had won their claim and censorship of the
press on the edifying principle that it was not right to print
anything that was "offensive to <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s"; and to obtrude this
cordial alliance of <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> with the <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese government, which
had by this time incurred the loathing of every decent man and
would be decidedly offensive to <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s. Yet the cordiality
continued through all the years of mendacity, hypocrisy, outrage,
and increasing menace to the world.</p>

<p> On December 26 <ent type='ORG'>Matsuoka</ent>, who was particularly used for some
years to dupe <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns because he was a <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent>, said in the
<ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese <ent type='ORG'>Diet</ent>, dropping the mask of lust now that <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> could take
advantage of the war in Europe, that there would be peace only if
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent> agreed that <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> should "dominate the mainland and occupy
a preferential position in Indo-<ent type='GPE'>China</ent> and the <ent type='NORP'>Dutch</ent> Indies," and to
"dominate the Western <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent>"; not for its own profit, of course,
but for "the good of humanity." In March, 1941, this slimiest of
the yellow reptile-group went to <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent> and signed a cynical pact
with <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>. We will not call that hypocrisy because <ent type='PERSON'>Stalin</ent> was
certainly not duped, but that was not for lack of intention on
Matsuoka's part. He went on to <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> to discuss with the
other gangsters the real plan for the summer, the sudden attack on
<ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> and the question of <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese intervention, and he had also
a long cordial talk with <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>, who presented him with a gold
medal. All this can be verified in Keesing's admirable day-to-day
survey of the world-press. Are we asked to believe that with the
<ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Matsuoka</ent> discussed only the spiritual interests of the <ent type='NORP'>Chinese</ent>
who were under the loving care of the <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese army of occupation?</p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p> What exactly the situation is today it is impossible to
ascertain. <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> will, of course, soon or later double cross the
Vatican, as those super-crooks always do. Has it already done so?
The latest news is that the <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese are organizing a National
Spiritual Mobilization Campaign in which three recognized
religions, <ent type='ORG'>Shinto</ent>, Buddhism, and <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent>ity are to cooperate. But
the <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> is to be purely <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese. It must receive no
funds from abroad -- which opens up a nice prospect for the
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Protestant missions -- admit no foreign influence, and
make minute reports of all its services and activities; and the
worship of the Son of Heaven must be included in the cult
everywhere. Has <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent>-Pius swallowed that pill?</p>

<p> In the eighteenth century <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> made it, one of its chief
counts in its indictment of the <ent type='NORP'>Jesuit</ent>s that, in order to win more
converts than other missionaries, they had mixed heathen rites with
<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> has done just that. An <ent type='NORP'>Anglican</ent> prelate who was
present at the large <ent type='ORG'>International Conference</ent> on religion in India
in 1938 wrote me that the representatives of the Protestant
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>es learned with a shock that "the <ent type='ORG'>Papacy</ent>, after much
wavering, has finally given permission to <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese Papists to
indulge in Emperor worship." Presumably they do not tell their
<ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese converts how early <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent>s died rather than worship the
<ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> Emperor.</p>

<p> It should prove, when the details are known, a picturesque
development, but to most of us trifle in comparison with the
Vatican's moral apostasy and betrayal of civilization. For an
exhibition of greed, hypocrisy, and condonation of crime its
alliance with <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> would be hard to beat. During these ten years
when <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> was vilifying <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, which was building up in peace
and with a sense of international honor what most people now call
great civilization, he was cultivating friendly relations with and
giving aid and encouragement to one of the real blackguard-nations.
It is futile to protest that we must look at the Situation from the
Papal angle. The most respectable light in which you can put it is
that a <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>man would be bound to consider that a prospect of
bringing into the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> sphere of influence, which is so much more
morally effective than any other, all the missionary work in
eastern <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>, outweighs all other considerations. So much the worse
for the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>man's creed or policy. It puts the increase of the
power of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> above all decency of international intercourse,
above the appalling sufferings of hundreds of millions of <ent type='NORP'>Chinese</ent>
and their right to a national life of their own, above the ghastly
and very imminent chances of a world-war. it means that the Black
International tramples on those social, moral, and humanitarian
principles which are said by its apologists in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> to be just
what the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> holds most sacred.</p>

<p> HE ORGANIZES THE <ent type='ORG'>PLOT</ent> IN SOUTH AMERICA</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent>-Pius was rightly selected for the <ent type='ORG'>Papacy</ent> as the ablest
cardinal in the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent>. That does not imply genius. Half of
these cardinals would not successfully run a large grocery store.
<ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> has considerable ability. He is also the most widely-</p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p>informed cardinal on the world-situation. His immediate
predecessors were of the type that asks: What are <ent type='PERSON'>Keats</ent>? Even <ent type='PERSON'>Leo</ent>
XIII was amazingly duped by his Vatican 'specialists' about the
state of affairs in <ent type='GPE'>England</ent> -- they persuaded him that if he
recognized the validity of <ent type='NORP'>Anglican</ent> "orders" the whole <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> of
<ent type='GPE'>England</ent> would join up under <ent type='GPE'>the Papal</ent> banner -- in <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>, and
elsewhere. <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> has travelled more than any. Besides spending
twelve years in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y he has made three visits to <ent type='GPE'>England</ent>,
travelled all over <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> and <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, and visited <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>,
Hungary, and other countries.</p>

<p> Upon which boast of his biographers we may make two comments.
First that in very few of his acts can any apologist make the
excuse of ignorance or misinformation, the common <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> excuse
for Papal misconduct. <ent type='ORG'>Matsuoka</ent> might deceive some people with his
bland assurances that his country sought "not the good of the good
of <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> but the good of humanity" and (in the spring of 1941) that
it had "not the slightest idea of taking advantage of the
misfortunes of <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>," but he no more deceived Pius XII than he
deceived <ent type='PERSON'>Stalin</ent>. The <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent> knew well that <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> was pledged to a
course, in its selfish interest, which would lead inexorably to war
math <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Great Britain</ent>. So it was in every other part of
his policy.</p>

<p> The second comment is that, instead of flowers springing up
wherever <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> trod, as is told of holy men in earlier ages, the
path might generally be traced by blood and misery. The violence
had occurred in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> before he returned to it, but he took care
that it was not relaxed. He compels the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y to help
to power the most dangerous psychopath in Europe. He goes to <ent type='LOC'>South</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, and his visit is followed by the triumph of <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>
violence everywhere. He goes to <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States, and there is a
fresh demand for the extinction of <ent type='NORP'>Bolshevism</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>.
He goes to <ent type='GPE'>Paris</ent> in 1937 and <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> prepares to betray <ent type='GPE'>Czecho</ent>-<ent type='GPE'>Slovakia</ent> and, when the time comes, to betray itself. He goes to
Hungary in 1938 and it is ready to see <ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Czecho</ent>-<ent type='GPE'>Slovakia</ent>
enslaved and to march itself against <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> and help in every way
the destroyers of civilization.</p>

<p> The visit to <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> was in 1934, when the usual excuse
for Papal intrigue was given: he must preside at the <ent type='NORP'>Eucharist</ent>ic
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> at <ent type='GPE'>Buenos</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Aires</ent>. Twenty years, even thirty years ago, the
priests of <ent type='GPE'>Buenos</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Aires</ent> would not have dared to hold such a
function. When it was proposed to hold one in <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> Protestants
appealed to me to cooperate in getting <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s forbidden to have
a procession of their <ent type='NORP'>Eucharist</ent> in one street. I said that I would
rather encourage them to do so -- and take care that the crowd
understood what it meant. The doctrine is so monstrous and
incredible that the journalists who every year write with profound
respect about the holding of the <ent type='NORP'>Eucharist</ent>ic <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> cannot have
the least idea what it means.</p>

<p> You see a priest carrying a star-shaped golden vessel in the
center of which, enclosed in glass, is the white disk of a wafer of
wheaten flour. To the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> it was a thin wafer until the priest
breathed his magic wards over it, but there is no longer any flour
there. The substance of the cake has been annihilated: only the </p>

<p>accidents (the color, shape, feel, etc.) remain. As I have hid to
swallow it -- the wafer, I mean, as well is the doctrine --
thousands of times I can assure that the "accidents" are very much
like those of a dry cracker. It sticks to the pilate, etc. And on
the strength of this prehistoric theory of substance and accidents,
begot by the genius Aquinas out of <ent type='NORP'>Aristotle</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> today
sternly insists that the wafer has been annihilated, and the living
divine-human person of <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> has taken its place -- quite literally
-- that if you broke it into a hundred crumbs the living and entire
body of <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> would be present in each, and that this is true of
each one of the millions of wafers (<ent type='NORP'>Eucharist</ent>s) which are stored in
little safes on the altars of all the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>es in the
world. <ent type='GPE'>Pfew</ent>!</p>

<p> I say that in the earlier part of this century priests in
<ent type='GPE'>Buenos</ent> Aries or <ent type='ORG'>Rio</ent> or <ent type='GPE'>Lima</ent> would not have made a parade of that
belief in the streets The historic conflict of the <ent type='NORP'>Blacks</ent> and
<ent type='PERSON'>White</ent>s in <ent type='NORP'>Latin</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> had ended in an incomplete but considerable
victory for the <ent type='NORP'>Liberals</ent>. The middle-class was substantially
skeptical. In 1906 the Freethinkers of <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> held a
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Buenos</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Aires</ent>. The delegates crowded the Teatro
Argentino. <ent type='NORP'>Argentinians</ent> of high position (Vice-Admiral <ent type='PERSON'>Howard</ent>, Soto
and <ent type='PERSON'>Alvarez</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>the Council</ent> of <ent type='EVENT'>War</ent>, etc.) supported them. The
Presidents of <ent type='GPE'>Guatemala</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Uruguay</ent> sent telegrams of
congratulations in the name of their republics. <ent type='ORG'>The Women</ent>'s
Committee, of 50 members, included some the most brilliant writers
in <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. The leading papers treated the <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> with
respect . . .</p>

<p> And in 1934 the public men of <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent> were falling Over each
other to kiss Pacelli's ring. What had happened? The <ent type='ORG'>Reds</ent>, of
course. Socialism spread through <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> with extraordinary
rapidity after the last war, and the news of the revolution in
<ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent> in 1932 gave a powerful impetus to the movement. So impartial
an observer as the famous woman traveller <ent type='PERSON'>Rosita Forbes</ent> said in
1933 after a prolonged visit that "it is possible that the
organization and method's of <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> may be destined to
provide the machinery necessary to liberate the <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n
Republics" (Eight Republics in search of a Future, p. 7.) In <ent type='GPE'>Peru</ent>,
she found that "the educated youth of <ent type='GPE'>Peru</ent> is in the hands of
<ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent>." A minister who introduced an anti-<ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> law in the
<ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent>an <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> was compelled to resign, and the government
refused to recognize degrees granted by <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> universities. An
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n merchant who had lived 25 years in <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent> reported that
"Communism of the intellectual type" was very widespread. The
Alianza Popular Revolutionaria <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>na (Apra) swept the
continent, and its leader would have become President of <ent type='GPE'>Peru</ent> but
for Black corruption of the vilest kind. The Rev. Dr. McKay, a
Protestant missionary in the <ent type='NORP'>Argentine</ent>, said that the Trade Unions
turned out any worker who supported the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, that the workers
now commonly called a man they wanted to vituperate "you poor
Christ" (equivalent to the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n "son of a lady-dog"), and that
one of their leaders said publicly that the sound of the word God
made him spew. I was editing the Militant Atheist in 1933 and gave
plenty of details of this sort.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> to the rescue. Returning to the subject in the 'Appeal
to Reason' Library (No. 3) in 1935 I gave the symptoms of spreading
reaction and asked: "Will the struggle end as in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, and
<ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent>, in a coalition of all political parties with the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>
again Labor?" At the time <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> was still an obscure emissary of
<ent type='ORG'>the Vatican</ent> whose position as Secretary of State was according to
the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Press</ent>, not very secure. How bitterly we pay for not
watching the <ent type='ORG'>Black International</ent> more closely! In <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, as
in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, there were Socialist
leaders who said that the fight against the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> was over -- some
wanted friendly alliance with it -- and all attention must be
concentrated on the politico-economic struggle. And in the whole of
<ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> as in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Czecho</ent>-<ent type='GPE'>Slovakia</ent>, etc., within a year or two Socialism was bloodily trodden
underfoot and the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> was triumphant.</p>

<p> The change did not begin in 1934. The <ent type='NORP'>Blacks</ent> were already
organizing and intriguing everywhere, and futile revolts
strengthened their hands. But after 1934 the clerical-capitalist
revolution proceeded at a great pace. I have not a shred of proof
to offer that, <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> counted in the organization of this. Just
naughty suspicion, and you may please yourself whether you accept
it. I do not say that <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> intrigued to bring closer together
the heads of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> and the heads of the army and state who in
every part of <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> were shuddering before the Red Menace.
The only facts we know are that the situation was completely
transformed after 1934; that within a few years six of the ten
Republics of <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> including <ent type='GPE'>Brazil</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Peru</ent>, were
truculently <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>, and even <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent> (where the priests have no
millions of <ent type='NORP'>Indians</ent> to stir up) and <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent> were semi-<ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>; that
most of the <ent type='NORP'>Liberals</ent> had in fact lined up with the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>; and that
this coalition was first revealed on a large scale when <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent>,
the arch-intriguer and hater of Socialism in every form had gone
from capital to capital and soldiers and statesmen knelt for his
blessing. You may want to go father than I do and believe that
<ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> not only promoted the entire cordial of <ent type='NORP'>Liberal</ent> statesmen
and their traditional enemies, but encouraged also the leaders of
the millions of <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>s and <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>s, who, as the duped statesmen
have now found, were already secretly weaving their great plot.
Please yourself.</p>

<p> The upshot was that not only was "the menace of <ent type='NORP'>Bolshevism</ent>"
destroyed in <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> but the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> got between ten and
twenty million apostates bullied into silence and their leaders
flung into jail. Figures are farcical in <ent type='NORP'>Latin</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. In <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>
a high official warned me privately that their published statement
that their population consisted of 4000000 <ent type='NORP'>Indians</ent> and 12000000
<ent type='NORP'>Mexican</ent>s might be turned the other way round. A careful recent
estimate is that there are 90000000 Indian's in <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> and Central
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. Few people seem to realize that these provide about one-third of the total number of <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>'s real subjects. As in
<ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>, the majority of them would turn against the priests as soon
as they got encouragement to do so from their government. The
situation was closely parallel to that of <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>. Within another
ten years the great bulk of the 90000000 would be lost to the
Vatican. Are we asked to think that <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> scrupulously avoided </p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p>political maneuvers that promised to avert that tragedy? Remember
the <ent type='NORP'>Irish</ent> revolutionaries confiding their plot to <ent type='LOC'>the Pope</ent>;
remember Dollfus's, <ent type='PERSON'>Franco</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Henlein</ent>, and others.</p>

<p> But we are concerned with actualities. The cream of the
<ent type='NORP'>Indians</ent>, of the millions of workers of such mixed blood that it is
time we dropped these racial distinctions, are the industrial
workers. The majority, we saw, had abandoned <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent>, Add the
university youths and a large number of their professors and other
middle-class men and <ent type='NORP'>Liberals</ent> of the old school, and it will be
seen that <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> had to envisage an actual secession of between ten
and twenty millions. They are now back in the fold -- on paper.
They are bullied into silence and their most active representatives
are in jail. By the end of 1935 there were 10000 political
prisoners in jail in <ent type='GPE'>Brazil</ent> alone. Yes, says the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>, the scum
who had recently organized a rebellion. So it was reported in
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. But the very impartial <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> 'Annual Register' (1935)
which gives the above figure adds: "Among these were university
professors and many other distinguished <ent type='GPE'>Brazil</ent>ians belonging to the
best society" (p. 312). They were victims of the Black
International.</p>

<p> And by one of those blunders into which the brutally and
callousness of the agents of these <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> governments are always
betraying them we learned that this <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>-Wealth coalition is not
only using force but, as it has always done, using it savagely. The
<ent type='GPE'>Brazil</ent>ian police arrested as spies two ladies of the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>
aristocracy, Lady <ent type='PERSON'>Hastings</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Lady Cameron</ent>, who were visiting <ent type='ORG'>Rio</ent>.
Viscount <ent type='PERSON'>Hastings</ent> wrote a letter to the <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> press (News-Chronicle, July 14, 1936) on what they saw. It contained such
things as:</p>

<p> In the prison they saw men and women who had been so
badly beaten that they could only move with the greatest
difficulty; a man's wife had been beaten insensible in front
of him to make him confess; the hands of another man had been
mutilated by having iron spikes driven underneath the nails
... The day before my wife and sister were arrested, the
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n boy <ent type='PERSON'>Victor Baron</ent> was found dead in prison after
'questioning' . . .</p>

<p> Immutable <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent>! So it was in <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> in the thirteenth century,
all over south Europe in the nineteenth, in <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent> forty years ago,
and is now in many countries. If a mere working man, or even a
professor, had reported these things, moat people would say "Red
lies." There is obviously some use in <ent type='NORP'>Aristocrats</ent>.</p>

<p> In <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent> the struggle with the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> and the attempt of
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> to get intervention, which would certainly
mean war and annexation, had begun long before <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> became
Secretary of State. I am tracing the action of the Black
International not of <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> alone but I have written this earlier
history so fully elsewhere that I will not return to it. I need
repeat only about the acute conflict of 1926 that I was then in
<ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent> and saw with what remarkable indifference the people
accepted what was <ent type='PERSON'>mendaciously</ent> called the persecution of the
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, and read articles by <ent type='NORP'>Mexican</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> journalists in the </p>

<ent type='ORG'>THE RED</ent> POPE</p>

<p>leading <ent type='GPE'>Havana</ent> paper a little later expressing deep disgust with
the lies (executions of priests etc.) sent by the priests to the
<ent type='ORG'>Knights</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Columbus</ent>, who zealously enlarged them and circulated
them in Wall Street. If you want a <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> (or at all events pro-<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>) witness to this close alliance for years of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s. and Wall Street read George <ent type='PERSON'>Selde</ent>s' '<ent type='ORG'>The Vatican</ent>' (1934,
pp. 278-86). There was, of course, an outcry and the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> bishops published a letter denying that they were working
for armed intervention." They merely felt it their duty to "sound
a warning to <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> civilization that its foundations are being
attacked and undermined." God, they said would find a way to,
destroy the evil. By priests blowing trumpets, I suppose. A thinner
pretense of pacifism it would be hard to find. It has a <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese
ring.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> did not go to <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>, but the brilliant <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>
success that followed his visit to <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> had echoes in the
north. In 1935 F.V. Williams, Al Smith's publicity agent, had a
revolting article in '<ent type='GPE'>Liberty</ent>' (Aug. 24) calling for intervention.
A <ent type='NORP'>Mexican</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> annihilated his statements in the 'Forum;' in
fact, they had been answered in advance by various visitors to
<ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent> (World-Telegram, June 8, 1935, etc.) The <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Teeling
also admits that <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s intrigued at <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> to get
intervention and that Msgr. <ent type='PERSON'>Burke</ent> served as intermediary.</p>

<p> It is, at all events, true that from 1936 <ent type='PERSON'>Pacelli</ent> included
<ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent> in the list of countries in which he invited the great
powers to "extinguish" <ent type='NORP'>Bolshevism</ent>. It was so clearly a war-program
that I have never read even a <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> attempt to give his words,
the slogan he sent through the whole <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> world, any other
meaning. An innocent young nun or a Lord <ent type='GPE'>Halifax</ent> might suggest that
he "extinguish it by prayer." Is that what he meant when he sent
Cardinal Faulhaber, as we shall see, to beg <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> to allow the
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> to cooperate with him in the good work? It was a war
program; a call to, as it has proved, the bloodiest war in history.
So who are the real <ent type='ORG'>Reds</ent>?</p>
