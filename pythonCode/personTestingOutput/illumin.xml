<p>- A 20 Year History In Brief</p>

<p>"Fear them not, therefore; for there is nothing covered that shall not be
revealed; and hidden, that shall shall not be known. "What I tell you in
darkness, that espeak in light; and what ye hear in the ear, that proclaim
upon the housetops." Matthew</p>

companies and dummy corporations to conceal their takeover operations of

United <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> Bank through <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>-linked <ent type='ORG'>Lockheed</ent> Aircraft Corporation.
Both banks used by <ent type='ORG'>Onassis</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Khashoggi</ent> to funnel bribes and payoffs via
the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>Deak Bank</ent> to captive <ent type='NORP'>Japanese</ent> and other crooked politi<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>ns.

Street which will be rented to <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent>, another at Plimmer Steps
to house <ent type='GPE'>West Germany</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> will set up eavesdropping communications centre inside the Willeston
Street building and another at 163 The Terrace which will link with
equipment installed in the Plimmer Steps building. Four <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> techni<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>ns
will run the whole operation.</p>

<p>April 1974: Finance Minister <ent type='PERSON'>Rowling</ent> appoints <ent type='PERSON'>Ron Trotter</ent> to the Overseas
Investment Commission, whose chairman, G. Lau, is also a member of the <ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Foundation</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/<ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent>) investment board.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Whitlam</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Kirk</ent></p>

<p>Mid-1974: Gough <ent type='ORG'>Whitlam</ent> and Norman <ent type='PERSON'>Kirk</ent> begin a series of moves absolutely
against the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Trilateralist</ent>s. <ent type='ORG'>Whitlam</ent> refuses to waive restrictions on
overseas borrowings to finance <ent type='ORG'>Alwest Aluminium Consortium</ent> of Rupert
<ent type='ORG'>Murdoch</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>BHP</ent> and R.J. Reynolds. <ent type='ORG'>Whitlam</ent> had also ended <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> War
support, blocked uranium mining and wanted more control over US secret spy
bases - e.g. Pine Gap.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Kirk</ent> had introduced a new, tough Anti-Monopoly <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent> and had tried to
redistribute income from big companies to the labour force through price
regulation and a wages policy.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Kirk</ent> had also rejected plans to build a second aluminium smelter near
<ent type='GPE'>Dunedin</ent> and was preparing the Petroleum Amendment <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent> to give more control
over <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> oil resources.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Kirk</ent> had found out that <ent type='PERSON'>Hunt</ent> Petroleum, drilling in <ent type='LOC'>the Great South Basin</ent>,
had discovered a huge resource of oil comparable in size to the <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Sea
or <ent type='NORP'>Alaskan</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Slope. Gas reserves alone now estimated at 30 times
bigger than <ent type='ORG'>Kapuni</ent> and oil reserves of at least 20 billion barrels - enough
for <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> to be self-sufficient for years. Oil companies completely
hushed up these facts. To have announced a vast new oil source would
probably mean a decline in world oil prices, which would not have allowed
<ent type='ORG'>OPEC</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Onassis</ent> plans for the <ent type='NORP'>Arabs</ent> to eventuate. N.Z. could be exploited
at a later date, particularly since the <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Sea operations were about to
come on stream - <ent type='PERSON'>Kirk</ent> was the last to hold out.</p>

<p>September, 1974: According to <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> sources, <ent type='PERSON'>Kirk</ent> was killed by the
<ent type='ORG'>Trilateralist</ent>s using <ent type='ORG'>Sodium Morphate</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Rowling</ent>'s f<ent type='ORG'>irs</ent>t act as NZ Prime
Minister was to withdraw <ent type='PERSON'>Kirk</ent>'s Anti-Monopoly <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent> and the Petroleum
Amendment <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent>.</p>

<p>Later, <ent type='PERSON'>Rowling</ent> was to be rewarded with ambassadorship to <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>.
Incidentally, the Shah of <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> was murdered the same way as <ent type='PERSON'>Kirk</ent> on his
arrival in the US.</p>

<p>6th October, 1974: <ent type='PERSON'>Ray</ent> cline implements <ent type='PERSON'>William Colby</ent> plan to oust
<ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralian Prime Minister <ent type='ORG'>Whitlam</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank finances payoffs to
<ent type='PERSON'>Malcolm Fraser</ent> and other pro-US politi<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>ns. A joint bugging operation
commences between <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and ASIA.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Rupert Murdoch</ent>, playing his part, uses his newspapers and television
network to spread lies and misinformation. <ent type='ORG'>Whitlam</ent>, as well as refusing to
waive restrictions on overseas borrowing to finance the aluminium
consortium, had plans to ensure that all corporations were at least 50%
<ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralian-owned. This interfered with the <ent type='ORG'>Seven Sisters</ent>' plans to build
three oil refineries at Cape <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent>umberland in South <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia to exploit
<ent type='LOC'>the Great South Basin</ent> discovery.</p>

<p>December, 1974: <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralian Governor-General <ent type='PERSON'>John Kerr</ent> joins <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Ray</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Cline</ent></ent>'s
payroll and received his f<ent type='ORG'>irs</ent>t pay-off of $US200000 credited to his
account number 767748 at the <ent type='GPE'>Singapore</ent> branch of the <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank.</p>

<p>11th November, 1975: Governor-General <ent type='PERSON'>Kerr</ent> sacks the <ent type='ORG'>Whitlam</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>.</p>

<p>August 1975: <ent type='PERSON'>Rowling</ent> re-introduces unrecognisable <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent>, designed
to aid monopolisation of the NZ economy and repeals the News <ent type='ORG'>Media</ent>
Ownership Act, allowing more foreign ownership of NZ media. The new
legislation does not define monopoly, competition or stipulate permissable
maximum market share, or even ascertain what the public interest is -
resulting in a sell-out to big business.</p>

<p>December, 1975: Election battle between <ent type='PERSON'>Rowling</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent>. Oil companies
pour thousands of dollars into <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent>'s campaign via <ent type='ORG'>National Bank</ent> (NZ),
whose general manager <ent type='PERSON'>Mowbray</ent> is also a member of <ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Foundation</ent>s;
Investment Board Director Tudhope also Managing Director <ent type='ORG'>Shell Oil</ent> and
Chairman <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/<ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> wins.</p>

<p>February, 1976: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> implements pre-election secret agreement with the
NZ <ent type='ORG'>Seven Sisters</ent>' oil representatives of <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/<ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent> for helping finance
the <ent type='ORG'>National Party</ent> campaign.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> removes the $3 per barrel oil levy for the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Refining
Company, which increases the oil companies' profits by 100% at the
taxpayers' expense and with all future oil prospecting licenses, the
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> has the option to take 51% of any discovery without meeting
exploration costs. This is designed to discourage further exploration,
thereby keeping the lid on <ent type='LOC'>the Great South Basin</ent> discovery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia, new P.M. <ent type='PERSON'>Malcolm Fraser</ent> reopens uranium mining and
opens the way for takeover of mineral resources with big tax breaks for oil
exploration, coal and mining.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> returns a favour to the oil companies by arranging $US200 million
loan for <ent type='ORG'>Maui Gas Development</ent> for <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/<ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent>.</p>

<p>September, 1976: With captive politi<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>ns in place in both <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia and
<ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>, the <ent type='NORP'>Internationalists</ent> can now proceed with their strategy of
takeover of the economy and exploitation of natural resources. "In New
Zealand, the elimination of unnecessary competition is fundamental to a
sound economy," <ent type='PERSON'>Brierly</ent> says.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Parksy</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Colby</ent> use <ent type='PERSON'>Brierly</ent>/<ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent> Investments as a vehicle to buy into
A.B. <ent type='ORG'>Consolidated Holdings</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>.</p>

<p>Asso<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>te of R. <ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Pat Goodman</ent>, is appointed 'consultant' of A'<ent type='NORP'>asian</ent>
and <ent type='ORG'>Pacific Holdings</ent>.</p>

<p>November, 1976: The <ent type='NORP'>Internationalists</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>) set up a NZ money 'funnel'
using <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>City Realties</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>National Insurance</ent> Co acquires 33% of the
stock. Largest stockholders in <ent type='ORG'>National Insurance</ent> are the US Firemen's
Fund - Chairman and President Myron Du Bain also Vice Chairman of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n
Express (<ent type='ORG'>Amex</ent>). Chairman of I.E.L. linked <ent type='ORG'>International Harvester</ent>, Archie
McCardell, also <ent type='ORG'>Amex</ent> Director. <ent type='ORG'>Amex</ent> linked with <ent type='ORG'>Chase Manhattan</ent> and Seven
Sisters' <ent type='ORG'>Texaco</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Mobil</ent>. Du Bain also Director of <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>-linked United
<ent type='GPE'>California</ent> Bank, which is a partner in Commer<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Trust.</p>

<p>To complete the money funnel, <ent type='ORG'>National Insurance</ent> becomes a stockholder in
<ent type='ORG'>Chase Manhattan</ent>'s Chase-NBA. <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>'s declared assets reach $100
million, with shareholder's capital of only $2.5 million - all cash
acquisitions.</p>

<p>3rd February, 1977: <ent type='PERSON'>Parksy</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Colby</ent> close down the <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>/<ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent>
Investment funnel and open up seperate channels for <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent>.
<ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent> will be supplied with 'laundered' funds via <ent type='GPE'>Sydney</ent> branch of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank, while for Ron <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Gerald Parsky</ent> uses Myron Du Bain,
Director of United <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> Bank and also chairman and president of the
US Firemen's Fund, which are the largest stockholders in <ent type='ORG'>National Insurance</ent>
(NZ). Funds to be 'laundered' via <ent type='ORG'>Chase Manhattan</ent> Bank through National
Insurance to City Realty and via United <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> Bank through <ent type='ORG'>COMPAC</ent>
(<ent type='LOC'>New Hebrides</ent>) to <ent type='ORG'>National Insurance</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>City Realties</ent>.</p>

<p>To expand the Bierley/I.E.L. 'front', <ent type='PERSON'>Parsky</ent> establishes Industrial Equity
<ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> (<ent type='GPE'>Hong Kong</ent>).</p>

<p>September 1977: <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>'s new holding company begins operations -
A.B. Consolidated. H.W. <ent type='ORG'>Revell</ent> appointed Deputy Chairman and B. Hancox
General Manager, while newly-appointed directors include S. Cushing,
B. Judge, O. <ent type='PERSON'>Gunn</ent> and P. <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>, linked with <ent type='ORG'>Renouf</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Papps</ent>
through I.E.L./N.Z.U.C.</p>

<p>* Strategy: To target and divide key sectors of the economy for takeover,
exploitation and monopolization. <ent type='ORG'>Operations</ent> to extend to use <ent type='GPE'>Hong Kong</ent>
facility, I.E.P. <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>s to extend the <ent type='ORG'>Khashoggi</ent>/<ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Travelodge</ent>
operation by taking holdings in <ent type='ORG'>Vacation Hotels</ent> and Intercontinental
Properties (<ent type='ORG'>Renouf</ent> Chairman).</p>

<p>October, 1977: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> and JOhn <ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent> - <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/<ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent> - sign an agreement.
NZ Govt would take 24.5% holding in <ent type='LOC'>the Great South Basin</ent> for $1.65
<ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent>ion. <ent type='PERSON'>Hunt</ent> would reduce his holding from 45.5% to 27.5% and <ent type='ORG'>Arco</ent> would
sell its 6.5%.</p>

<p>* Reason: <ent type='PERSON'>Hunt</ent> did not possess the technology to pump oil from deep water;
<ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> possessed the technology but did not tell <ent type='PERSON'>Hunt</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Arco</ent> was not told
anything and were swindled out of its 6.5% concession.</p>

<p>November, 1977: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> introduces the S.I.S Amendment <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent>, designed to
keep the economy free of obstruction and to help uncover obstructive
elements. Telephone taps, mail tampering and other surveillance methods
approved after <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> input on contents of legislation.</p>

<p>Late 1977: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> travels to the US to meet top <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> offi<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>ls,
including <ent type='ORG'>Trilateralist</ent>s' Deputy Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Warren Christopher</ent>,
and <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Bolbrooke</ent>, who were in charge of the new "South <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Desk"
at the <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> Department established by <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> to target exploitation
of both <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia. In <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> meets top
<ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> offi<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>ls, <ent type='PERSON'>Robert Anderson</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>Rockwell</ent> Chairman, also Director of
<ent type='GPE'>Kashoggi</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>Security Pacific</ent> <ent type='ORG'>National Bank</ent>) and P. Larkin (<ent type='ORG'>Rockwell</ent>
Director, also Chairman, <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Committee <ent type='ORG'>Security Pacific</ent> <ent type='ORG'>National Bank</ent>
and Director of <ent type='PERSON'>Marac</ent>).</p>

<p>April, 1978: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> sets up <ent type='ORG'>Petrocorp</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> taxpayers pay for the
exploration costs but the oil companies control all distribution outlets.
<ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> blocks development of <ent type='LOC'>Maui</ent> B as restructured supplies mean higher
prices and bigger profits for <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/<ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent>. <ent type='LOC'>South Island</ent> gas market not
developed as <ent type='LOC'>Great South Basin</ent> fields closer than <ent type='ORG'>Kapuni</ent>. Plans develop
for re-opening of <ent type='ORG'>National Parks</ent> for mineral exploitation.</p>

<p>22nd July, 1978: Director of <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralian Federal Bureau of Narcotics
suspends his investigation into the <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank after pressure from the
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralian politi<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>ns controlled by <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>, particularly Malcolm
Fraser.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Brierly</ent>'s declared assets reach $200 million, with shareholders' funds only
$17 million.</p>

<p>May, 1979: <ent type='ORG'>Trilateral Commission</ent> secretary <ent type='PERSON'>Zbignieu Brzezinski</ent> appoints
<ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> chairman of Board of Governors of IMF/<ent type='ORG'>World Bank</ent> on orders of
<ent type='PERSON'>David Rockefeller</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> would head three-man administration committee
which included <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> Finance Minister <ent type='PERSON'>Mitchell Sharp</ent>, key figure in the
<ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Council</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>Trilateral Commission</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralian <ent type='PERSON'>Treasurer</ent> McMahon
also involved.</p>

<p>8th June, 1979: <ent type='PERSON'>Michael Hand</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Frank Nugan</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>James Fetcher</ent> meet
in Hand's <ent type='GPE'>Sydney</ent> penthouse to discuss the establishment of the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> organization.</p>

<p>Mid-1979: <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> Oil using its man <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, begins operations designed to
capture key sectors of the economy. A.B Consolidated restructured into the
<ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent> Group and <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent> to run operations but with the majority of the
stock held by IEL and <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> using <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent> companies plus dummy
corporations.</p>

<p>* Strategy: To take over food and produce resources, <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>
restructured a small private company, H.W. Smith, using <ent type='PERSON'>Cyril Smith</ent> as
Chairman but with key executives Judge, <ent type='PERSON'>Collins</ent> and McKenzie.
<ent type='PERSON'>Bob Jones</ent> helps.</p>

<p>Private company used, as no <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent> Commission control, accounts not
published, no public disclosure of transactions. Bunting is established as
a shell company and the <ent type='LOC'>South Island</ent> is targeted for asset-stripping and
takeover, as well as key sectors of the automobile industry.</p>

<p>Unlimited funds channelled through <ent type='ORG'>City Realties</ent>, NZUC and <ent type='PERSON'>Marac</ent>.
<ent type='ORG'>UEB</ent> extends <ent type='ORG'>Travelodge</ent> operations by buying control of <ent type='ORG'>Transholdings</ent>, which
has strategic holdings in <ent type='ORG'>Vacation Hotels</ent> and Tourist Corp. <ent type='GPE'>Fiji</ent> Holdings.</p>

<p>17th August, 1979: <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> inaugral meeting in <ent type='GPE'>Sydney</ent> including
Hand, <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>, R.<ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Alan Hawkins</ent> and L.<ent type='PERSON'>Papps</ent>.</p>

<p>Key sectors of the economy would be taken over - food, using <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>;
forestry and farming, using <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent>; property, using <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>
and <ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, Hand and <ent type='PERSON'>Papps</ent> would be responsible for banking,
insurance and finance, while <ent type='ORG'>Hand and Hawkins</ent> would be responsible for
setting up new "laundry" channels into <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>.</p>

<p>The economy would be taken over using cheap loans of less than 5%, while
consumers would pay 28%.</p>

<p>October, 1979: BP Oil begis $100 million joint venture deal with <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>
and <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent> at Tasman.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> makes secret deal with oil companies which effectively robs New
Zealand taxpayers by giving <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/<ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent> the <ent type='LOC'>Maui</ent> Gas deal. Normally the
granting of drilling rights on public land is done using a worldwide system
which incorporates an auction tender system. <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> bypassed this.
Also, <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/<ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent> pays no tax on <ent type='ORG'>Kapuni</ent> profits, while putting funds into
<ent type='LOC'>Maui</ent> development.</p>

<p>19th November, 1979: Secret meeting in <ent type='GPE'>Auckland</ent> between <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>
and <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent> to transfer 43% <ent type='ORG'>Tasman Pulp and Paper</ent> held by <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> to <ent type='ORG'>Challenge Corporation</ent> (Chairman <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent>) and <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>s.
Tasman has lucrative 75-year contract for cheap timber signed in 1955.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> paid off with a $1 million 'non-repayable' loan - $500000 to be
paid into account number 8746665 at <ent type='LOC'>New Hebrides</ent> branch of the <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralian
International Bank.</p>

<p>November, 1979: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> drops restrictions on foreign investment.
<ent type='ORG'>AMAX</ent> (Stnadard Oil of <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> subsidiary) captures the <ent type='PERSON'>Martha Hill</ent>
goldmine.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> unveils the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>'s plans (instructed by <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>) to form
<ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> into an offshore production base for the multi-national
corporations as benefits include government export incentives, stable
government, cheap labour, and so on.</p>

<p>27th November, 1979: <ent type='PERSON'>Gerald Parsky</ent>'s lieutenant, <ent type='PERSON'>David Kennedy</ent>, meets
<ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> to deliver $US100000 cash to <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> for implementing the
<ent type='NORP'>Internationalists</ent>' <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> Think Big plans.</p>

<p>These plans began with big contracts and guaranteed profits for the Seven
Sisters, <ent type='ORG'>Bechtel</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Mitsubishi</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Mitsui</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Nippon Steel</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>Internationalists</ent>'
<ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> banks.</p>

<p>With the experimental petroleum plant, the oil price has to be $50/barrel
to be profitable, yet <ent type='ORG'>Mobil</ent>'s profits are guaranteed.</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Steel is to be expanded 500%, even though there was a global
steel glut of 50%.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>s own 10% of <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Steel and are majority stockholders in
<ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Steel and control monopoly over wire rod, reinforcing steel. Also,
<ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> taxpayers subsidize <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>s' profits.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> introduces the National Development <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent> with 'fast-track'
legislation, to keep the economy 'free of obstruction' for long-term
monopolization.</p>

<p>C.E.R. plan introduced, designed to integrate the economies of <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia
and <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> with the <ent type='ORG'>Trilateral Commission</ent> for the purpose of
exploiting the South <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> countries and as a 'back-door' entrance into
<ent type='GPE'>China</ent> - the world's largest untapped consumer market. <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> is also
the closest country to <ent type='LOC'>Antarctica</ent>, which has a vast mineral resource for
future exploitation.</p>

<p>"Think Big" projects begin, even though <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> aware of studies that show
<ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> could conserve up to 40% of energy consumption using existing
technology, which would mean funds could be invested elsewhere to lower
consumer prices, lower inflation rates, less demand for imported oil and
increased employment by creating new industry to manufacture and install
energy-saving technology. None of these options seriously considered as
all would lessen profits for members of the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> organizations.</p>

<p>December 1979: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> unveils 'stage two' of a four-stage plan to exploit
<ent type='LOC'>the Great South Basin</ent> discovery. Plan prepared by <ent type='ORG'>Trilateralist</ent> 'Think
Tank' - the Brookings <ent type='ORG'>Institute</ent>.</p>

<p>'Stage Two' includes methanol plant and synthetic petrol plant, which would
initially use gas from the <ent type='LOC'>Maui</ent> field and later would link with underwater
gas pipe from <ent type='LOC'>Campbell Island</ent>.</p>

<p>With the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Steel 500% expansion, 'stage three' of the project and
Think Big contracts to go to <ent type='ORG'>Bechtel</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Fluor Corp</ent>., <ent type='ORG'>Mitsubishi</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Mitsui</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'>Nippon Steel</ent>, etc. All investments would be financed by the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>
taxpayer.</p>

<p>17th January, 1980: $500000 deposited in <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent>'s account number 8746665
at the <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralian International Bank, being the final payment for the
Tasman deal.</p>

<p>Early 1980: <ent type='GPE'>Kashoggi</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Travelodge</ent> operations extended with affiliation
agreement between <ent type='ORG'>Dominion Breweries</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Western International Hotels</ent>
(Seattle F<ent type='ORG'>irs</ent>t <ent type='ORG'>National Bank</ent>).</p>

<p>May, 1980: <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>'s <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent> Hand banking operation crashes after <ent type='PERSON'>Frank Nugan</ent>
killed. Death ruled as suicide even though no fingerprints found on the
rifle. <ent type='ORG'>Maloney</ent>, Houghton, Yates and Hand shred important documents, but
miss some. <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> helps <ent type='ORG'>Hand and Bank</ent> President <ent type='PERSON'>Donald Beasley</ent> escape to the
U.S. The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralian Security Intelligence Organisation cover
everything up. <ent type='ORG'>Beazley</ent> appointed President of <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> City <ent type='ORG'>National Bank</ent>,

<ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> sells 10% of <ent type='ORG'>Watties</ent> to the NZ Dairy Board - setting the stage for

<p>February 1984: <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> politi<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>n D. <ent type='ORG'>Lange</ent> meets <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Ray</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Cline</ent></ent> in
<ent type='GPE'>Wellington</ent> and agrees to go on the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> payroll for monthly fee of
$UA40000 paid into account number 5263161 at Commer<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Trust,
<ent type='LOC'>New Hebrides</ent>.</p>

<p>March 1984: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> knighted with GCMG for keeping the economy free of
obstructions for easier takeover and exploitation.</p>

<p>24th May, 1984: Four-man <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> team co-ordinated by <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Ray</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Cline</ent></ent> arrive in New
Zealand to begin installation of equipment for subliminal television
advertising at five sites - <ent type='ORG'>Waiatarua</ent>, Mt Erin, <ent type='GPE'>Kaukau</ent>, <ent type='LOC'>Sugarloaf</ent> and
Obelisk.</p>

<p>Sophisticated equipment can be installed within one kilometer of TV relay
aerials and all linked to one <ent type='ORG'>IDAPS</ent> computer bureau in <ent type='GPE'>Auckland</ent>.</p>

<p>Same equipment installed in <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia August 1985; <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> September 1986;
UK February 1987: <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> 1987. Also, <ent type='ORG'>Amax</ent> geoligists now estimate Martha
Hill gold source could be worth up to $30 billion on strength of high
gold/ton ore assay.</p>

<p>17th July, 1984: In <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>, subliminal advertising begins on Channel
Two between 6pm and midnight - hours later extended to begin at noon.
Subliminal messages prepared in the US by the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and with <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>
election imminent, tell voters to support <ent type='ORG'>the Labour Party</ent>, the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>
Party and to buy <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> company products.</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Party was formed to ensure that <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> would lose, as Big
Business unhappy with controls over economy. Big campaign contributions
from <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, the oil companies and the Business Round Table ensure a
<ent type='ORG'>Labour</ent> victory.</p>

<p>Later, <ent type='ORG'>Lange</ent> agrees to repay the favour to <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> by selling the
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> holding in the Kariori Pulp Mill to <ent type='ORG'>Winstones</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>
taxpayer loses $100 million.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> then becomes the arm of big business, using economic policies
provided by the Business Round Table, implemented by Finance Minister Roger
<ent type='PERSON'>Douglas</ent> and the package being sold by David <ent type='ORG'>Lange</ent>, who also keeps up a
noisy <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> directed <ent type='ORG'>ANZUS</ent> withdrawal campaign.</p>

<p> * Reason: 1) <ent type='ORG'>ANZUS</ent> Treaty did not cover <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> requirements over the Great
South Basin discovery;
2) To identify any oppositin or threats within <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> who
align themselves with supposed <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> policy, <ent type='ORG'>Lange</ent> increases the <ent type='ORG'>SIS</ent>
budget and strangthens links with the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.</p>

<p>Brookings <ent type='ORG'>Institute</ent> are the actual designers of the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>
econmomic policies provided by the Business Round Table (NZ <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> front)
and implented by the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Douglas</ent> devalues the dollar and deregulates interest rates, which means
cheaper labor, cheaper capital assets and high mortgage rates, thereby
implementing <ent type='ORG'>Big Business</ent> policy of driving farmers off the land,
establishment of the corporate farm and eventually remove viability of
small business sector, etc.</p>

<p>27th September, 1984: <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> meets at new 'safe house'
registered under <ent type='PERSON'>Fernyhough</ent>'s name, in <ent type='GPE'>Auckland</ent>. Those present include

appointment of <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent> as International Vice President of the Trilateral
Commission <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Basin Economic <ent type='ORG'>Council</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> outlines strategy of privatization of the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>
and the establishment of the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Centre for Independent Studies
which will be chaired by <ent type='PERSON'>Gibbs</ent>, aided by <ent type='PERSON'>Fernyhough</ent> and controlled by
<ent type='PERSON'>Cline</ent>, which will 'advise' <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent> on privatization.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Parsky</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Seldon</ent> hold a separate meeting with <ent type='PERSON'>Parsky</ent>, outlining
plans for an expanded laundry operation which will coincide with the launch
of 'Crack' - a new addictive product developed by <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> chemists for the
world market.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Equiticorp</ent> (<ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>) will be launched with <ent type='PERSON'>Adler</ent> as Manager and a new merchant
bank using <ent type='ORG'>Eldrs</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent> and Jarden.</p>

<p>IEI will merge with <ent type='ORG'>Armco Bank</ent>, which has 20 branches in South East <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>;
<ent type='PERSON'>Ariadne</ent> will acquire <ent type='ORG'>the Bank</ent> of Queensland, and <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> Investments will
form a cross-shareholding with <ent type='ORG'>NZI Corp</ent> to further increase control by
their <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> organization. Other plans include the laundering of funds
directly to the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralian <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>s and the
establishment of key companies within the economies of <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia and <ent type='GPE'>Hong Kong</ent>.</p>

<p>The f<ent type='ORG'>irs</ent>t key company will control the food industry in <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralasia through
merger of Elders, <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>s, <ent type='ORG'>Allied Mills</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Fielder Gillespie</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Watties</ent>.
<ent type='ORG'>Allied Mills</ent> will control 30% <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>s, 30% Fielder, 20% <ent type='ORG'>Watties</ent> and will
expand into <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> via acquisition of Rank, Hovis McDougall (UK). Allied
Mills will be controlled through IEL.</p>

<p>26th October, 1984: <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Hawkins</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Lange</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Douglas</ent> meet in <ent type='GPE'>Wellington</ent>

banking system.</p>

<p>Late 1984: As part of the <ent type='ORG'>IDAPS</ent> computer-controlled 'laundry' operation,
<ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> help establish the '<ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Investment Fund' with
<ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralian and <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> investments to be managed by <ent type='GPE'>Hong Kong</ent> and
<ent type='GPE'>Shanghai</ent> Bank subsidiary, <ent type='PERSON'>Wardley</ent> and the <ent type='NORP'>Japanese</ent> operation controlled by
<ent type='ORG'>Tokyo Trust and Banking Company</ent> - owned by <ent type='ORG'>Sanwa Bank</ent>, Taiyo-Kobe Bank and
<ent type='ORG'>Nomura Securities</ent>. All are members of the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>World Government</ent>
organization.</p>

<ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia. In the UK, Tozer, Kemsly &amp; <ent type='PERSON'>MIllbourn</ent> would be taken over using
<ent type='ORG'>IEP</ent>, while in <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia, the <ent type='ORG'>Holme</ent>'s A'<ent type='ORG'>Court</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Bell Group</ent> would be used to

Packer and <ent type='ORG'>Bond</ent> (TV and Radio) <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Holme</ent>s A'<ent type='ORG'>Court</ent> (newspapers).</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Murdoch</ent> takes orders from <ent type='PERSON'>Brzezinski</ent> since his <ent type='ORG'>News Corp</ent> was taken over in
1982 by <ent type='ORG'>Chase Manhattan</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Security Pacific</ent> <ent type='ORG'>National Bank</ent>.</p>

<p>At a separate meeting with <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Seldon</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Cline</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Parsky</ent> outlines plan
for 'key' <ent type='ORG'>Media</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ral<ent type='NORP'>asian</ent> Holding company using the <ent type='ORG'>Bell Group</ent> which

George <ent type='ORG'>Franklin</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Brzezinski</ent> outlines plans to invade <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> using 75000 strong mercenary army
supported by US Air Force and <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> with starting date of 8th February,
1988. An integral part of the plan <ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>i oil tankers would fly
the US flag to provoke an <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>ian attack so that US invasion of <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> would
be 'justified'.</p>

<p> * Reason: The <ent type='ORG'>Seven Sisters</ent> wanted to exploit a secret oil field near
<ent type='PERSON'>Bandar Abbas</ent> discovered in 1976 with estimate 150 billion barrels and also
a huge gold source at <ent type='ORG'>Neyshabur</ent> discovered in 1977.</p>

<p>If you believe that then run and read "The <ent type='ORG'>Brotherhood</ent>" by <ent type='PERSON'>Stephen Knight</ent>.
In it he points out why many of the legends/stories/rumours about the

<p>He also describes, with examples, the mechanisms by which <ent type='ORG'>Freemason</ent>ry can
be a corrupting influence with deleterious effects on the public at large.</p>

<p>Re: Novus Ordo Seclorum.</p>

<p>This phrase is from the FREEMASONS 100%!</p>

<p>I will post more details later.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>Freemason</ent>s are alive and well in the <ent type='GPE'>USA</ent>. There are 33 degrees of
membership. On the top level are the leaders of various countries.
On the basic level there are people like you and me (ordinary <ent type='ORG'>Joes</ent>).
I do not mean to say I am a <ent type='ORG'>Freemason</ent>, by the way.</p>

<p>They are NOT known as <ent type='ORG'>Freemason</ent>s over here; they are known as "lodges".
Thus, the <ent type='ORG'>Shriners</ent>, the Elks, etc. are all the same group.</p>

<p>They are existing from the time of <ent type='PERSON'>Moses</ent>, or maybe even from before that.
It used to be <ent type='NORP'>Greek</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Roman</ent> influenced fraternity. They were outlawed in
<ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent> in the late 70's because of their involvement in some
questionable things. It is said that the <ent type='ORG'>Freemason</ent>s want to protect and
maintain a certain status quo in the world (make it safe for the extremely r
ich), but God knows best as to their real aims.</p>

<p>The Lodges are very active in doing some good things for the common man.
The <ent type='ORG'>Shriners</ent> have adopted a pseudo-<ent type='NORP'>Islamic</ent> pose, without having anything
to do with <ent type='ORG'>Islam</ent> as presented in the Quran. The <ent type='ORG'>Shriners</ent> have their own
"prophets" etc.</p>

<p>It is easy to join the <ent type='ORG'>Freemason</ent> fraternity on the basic level. You are
told that it is for uniting all the different nations and religions of the
world. You can only progress (up the 33 degrees) if you are of any use in
your so<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l position to the <ent type='ORG'>Freemason</ent>s. You may join as a basic <ent type='ORG'>Freemason</ent>,
and remain so all your life, and it would look like you just joined a
harmless so<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l club.</p>

<p>On the top level, their aims are quite different. They do not like any
organization (in the name of religion or anything else) to endanger their
finan<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l assets and interests. Some believe that the <ent type='ORG'>Freemason</ent>s have
been successful in completely destroying the faith of ordinary <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent>
by influencing and introducing corruption in the <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> church, and
distorting religious concepts. The big challenge before the <ent type='ORG'>Freemason</ent>s
now is to destroy the organizing power of <ent type='ORG'>Islam</ent>, which they view as the
final threat.</p>

<p>There has been some research done on the <ent type='ORG'>Freemason</ent>s, their introduction
methods, their activities (open and hidden), in <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent>
Arabia. If anyone is interested, I can detail everything in my following
posts.</p>

I forgot to give you the beta on the <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent>:

These folks are more secret than <ent type='PERSON'>Moussad</ent>(the <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>i SS) who is the
undisputed ultimate "secret agent men/women" experts of the world.
Therefore, you will find no reliable sources of information on them.

They like to frequent <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> chalets and spend their loot on good spirits
and women. Oh, they do not have women for members.

Their asso<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>tes are in international banking and are world leaders of
organized crime. But they are not ever necessarily top world leaders or
top CEO's, but they completely influence the major decisions of most
multinational companies and world leaders.

They are always there but you never see them:

Once, at a coffee shop in an affluent <ent type='GPE'>Denver</ent> 'burb in the foothills, I ran
across a man of this general authority. With a <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> accent, he had told
me that if I were to sit at a table, I was to buy coffee, but he did not
work there. He wore a $2000 <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> pilot's chronometer on one wrist. His
clothes cost at least half of the watch and he wasn't wearing a suit!
We were just waiting for the rain to stop and I could not believe my ears
when he tried to shoo me away from my dry spot under the curbside table's
canvas awning. I thought carefully and then replied something to the likes
of "The <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent> would always like for me to be recirculating my money
back into their economic system of manipulation."

As soon as I said this, never mind the weather, he took off. He was a
strong 50 year old <ent type='NORP'>Aryan</ent>, about 6'1", 200lbs, to my 5'11", 150lbs
but he looked extremely agitated before he left. I could tell he was not
physically scared of me. In fact, he knew all too well what I was saying
about the globally economic policies of his "asso<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>tes" in the <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent>.
You see, they have effectively cut off information about even their
existence, that it will damn near give one of them vapor lock if you call
their hand!
(Notice that <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> houses the ultimate banks next to <ent type='GPE'>Bavaria</ent> on <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent>
soil, and note how the <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> are given <ent type='ORG'>International Neutrality</ent> to boot so
that the Secret accounts will be safe and stable! I would wager a month of
Sundays that money in a <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> account is backed by real gold too!)

Conclusion:

<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> belongs to the "Skull and Crossbones Club" which is the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n
Equivalent of the <ent type='ORG'>Illuninati</ent>. You have to study at <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> and be in a family
that is part of the old boy system and then you might get in. It is highly
secret, but really is much more well known than the <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent>. It exists
to perpetuate the existence of the old boys in <ent type='NORP'>Amerika</ent>, much as the
<ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent> does the same in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>.

Amazingly, the only reference to the <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent> that I have ever seen other
than in a few paper back books on mysticism called the Trilogy which
actually are probably right 50% of the time, was in the Unabridged
Webster's Dictionary, where all it dares say is that they were "the members
of an anticlerical, deistic, republican society founded in 1776 by Adam
Weishaupt, professor of law at <ent type='GPE'>Ingolstadt</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Bavaria</ent>. It was suppressed by
the <ent type='GPE'>Bavaria</ent>n government in 1785: called also the Order of the <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent>."

I suppose they had to go deep undercover, much more so than even the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>.
This might explain the agitation I evoked in the fellow!

It might be fun to know more about these fellow, but you now know all you
need to know, except their names. <ent type='ORG'>Search</ent> and destroy!

<p>HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE BLOCKS S&amp;L INVESTIGATION
=====================================================
<ent type='ORG'>Convergence Magazine</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>Christic</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Institute</ent>, Winter 1991, p. 16</p>

<p>As <ent type='NORP'>Convergence</ent> went to press we learned that the House Intelligence
Committee will refuse to investigate the reported use of failed savings and
loan institutions to launder funds for the <ent type='PERSON'>Reagan</ent> Administration's secret
war in <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>.</p>

<p>The last issue of <ent type='NORP'>Convergence</ent> (Fall 1990) reported that an investigation by
<ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='NORP'>Christic</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Institute</ent></ent> had found new evidence that drug traffickers may
have taken advantage of S&amp;L deregulation to launder cocaine profits
destined for the <ent type='NORP'>contras</ent>. In a separate investigation, the <ent type='ORG'>Houston Post</ent> has
concluded that several failed S&amp;Ls were looted by businessmen connected
with both organized crime and <ent type='ORG'>the Central Intelligence Agency</ent>.</p>

<p>Last summer the <ent type='ORG'>House Banking</ent> subcommittee on finan<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l institutions
attempted to investigate the reports, but abandoned the effort when C.I.A.
Director <ent type='PERSON'>William Webster</ent> refused to testify. But the subcommittee's chair,
<ent type='GPE'>Illinois</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Frank Annunzio</ent>, referred the allegations to the House
<ent type='ORG'>Intelligence Committee</ent>, which has jurisdiction over <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s spy agencies.</p>

<p>On Nov. 15 <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='NORP'>Christic</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Institute</ent></ent> delivered 30000 petitions to
Rep. <ent type='PERSON'>Anthony Beilenson</ent>, the <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent> who cha<ent type='ORG'>irs</ent> the Intelligence
Committee, asking for a full investigation of the reports. The signatures
were gathered in 22 cities in one day of canvassing by volunteers from the
<ent type='NORP'>Christic</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Institute</ent>'s local action networks and the Citizen/Labor Energy
Coalition.</p>

<p>A spokesman for <ent type='ORG'>the intelligence committee</ent> said the staff had conducted
dozens of interviews to determine whether the reports should be
investigated. But in November investigative journalist <ent type='PERSON'>Pete Brewton</ent>
reported in the <ent type='ORG'>Houston Post</ent> that "the committee has not attempted to
trace any of the S&amp;L money looted by C.I.A. operatives.''</p>

<p>The committee staff also failed to contact a former C.I.A. contract agent
who told a Federal court in 1988 that the agency used funds from failed
banks and thrift institutions to finance covert operations.</p>

<p>When asked by <ent type='PERSON'>Brewton</ent> why the committee made no attempt to trace any S&amp;L
money to discover if it had been used for covert operations, staff director
<ent type='PERSON'>Dan Childs</ent> said "we have only three attorneys to do this.''</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Childs</ent> was the chief finan<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l officer for the C.I.A. during the period
when the alleged transfer of funds occurred.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>The <ent type='NORP'>Christic</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Institute</ent></ent>'s probe of S&amp;L fraud goes back to 1988, when
<ent type='NORP'>Christic</ent> investigators found evidence that C.I.A.-sponsored drug
traffickers may have used dozens of thrifts in several states to launder
cocaine profits destined for the contra war effort.</p>

<p>"<ent type='ORG'>The <ent type='NORP'>Christic</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Institute</ent></ent> has uncovered evidence that covert operatives and
drug traffickers exploited dozens of S&amp;Ls to launder funds destined for
the illegal contra war,'' said <ent type='PERSON'>Daniel</ent> P. Sheehan, the <ent type='ORG'>Institute</ent>'s general
counsel. "This evidence suggests that the links among S&amp;Ls, covert
operatives and organized crime can be traced to the 'off-the-shelf
enterprise' described by Oliver <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> before the <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>-contra investigating
committees.</p>

<p>"It appears that S&amp;Ls may have made fraudulent loans in order to siphon
money to the <ent type='NORP'>contras</ent> at a time when <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> had cut off aid to the
rebels.''</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Brewton</ent>'s investigative series in <ent type='ORG'>Post</ent> has concluded that "at least 27
failed finan<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l institutions (25 S&amp;Ls and two banks) had links to C.I.A.
operatives or to organized crime figures with links to the C.I.A..''</p>

<p>"The savings and loan collapse will cost taxpayers over $500 billion,''
said <ent type='PERSON'>Sara Nelson</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>Institute</ent>'s executive director. "If it is true that
S&amp;L money went to the <ent type='NORP'>contras</ent>, then the U.S. public was duped into paying
the bill for the contra war after <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> had outlawed contra aid.
The evidence pointing to a systematic fraud on</p>

<p>"The response to this petition has been enormous,'' said <ent type='PERSON'>Nelson</ent>, "and
shows just how upset people are that <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> has failed to investigate
the intelligence connection to the S&amp;L collapse. We hope that <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>man
<ent type='PERSON'>Beilenson</ent> will take this message very seriously.''</p>
