<p>Bewitching <ent type='ORG'>Science</ent>
by <ent type='PERSON'>Val Dusek</ent></p>

<p> [Note by <ent type='PERSON'>Brian Siano</ent>: This article originally appeared in
the November/December 1987 issue of _<ent type='ORG'>Science</ent> for the People_,
published by <ent type='ORG'>the Science Resource Center</ent>, 897 Main Street,
<ent type='GPE'>Cambridge</ent>, MA 02139. I don't even know if the magazine is still
being published; it's a shame, because it regularly dealt with
such topics as toxic wastes, nuclear power, eugenics,
biotechnology, and the like. I have a few back issues, one of
which has a dandy article in the psychological experiments of Dr.
<ent type='PERSON'>Ewen Cameron</ent> conducted in <ent type='GPE'>Canada</ent>. I wish a local newsstand still
carried it. (BTW, its editorial advisory board includes Stephen
Jay Gould and <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Lewontin</ent>.)
[Since this article appeared, <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> _has_ published his
data, although I don't have the specific references for where he
published. This article addresses his public statements prior to
publishing, and raises important questions as to <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent>'s
impartiality over his thesis.
[<ent type='PERSON'>Val Dusek</ent>, at the time of publication, taught philosophy at
<ent type='ORG'>the University</ent> of New Hampshire.]</p>

<p> For seven years, popular magazines have regaled us with
tales of <ent type='PERSON'>Oskar</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Jack</ent>, a pair of twins, one raised in <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>Germany</ent>, the other raised as a <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Trinidad</ent>, who both think it
funny to sneeze in elevators and always flush a toilet before
using it. We have also been told about <ent type='PERSON'>Bridget</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Dorothy</ent>,
<ent type='NORP'>British</ent> twins who each wore seven rings.
These anecdotes issue from scientists undertaking a massive
study of identical twins. The study, conducted by Thomas <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent>
and others at <ent type='ORG'>the University</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Minnesota</ent>, is said to show that
I.Q., personality traits, and virtually every other mental
attribute or behavior is heritable, or capable of being
inherited.
During the past year, lengthy articles have appeared in U.S.
News and World Report (a cover story), <ent type='ORG'>Discover</ent>, and <ent type='ORG'>Science</ent>.
Shorter pieces have appeared in <ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>, U.S. News and World Report,
the New York <ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s, and other magazines and newspapers. (1)
<ent type='ORG'>The Minnesota Twins Study</ent>'s "latest bombshell" (as U.S. News
calls it) purports to show that traits such as shyness,
political conservatism, dedication to hard work, orderliness,
and intimacy are to a great extent heritable, and that
extraversion, conformity, creativity, optimism, and cautiousness
are more determined by heredity than by environment.
Despite all the media coverage, the scientific data and
methods of analysis upon which these conclusions are based have
not yet been published in a refereed scientific journal. A
December 1986 article in the New York <ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s and one in the
January 12, 1987 issue of <ent type='ORG'>Time</ent> referred to results "submitted"
and "being reviewed" by professional journals. However, in the
August 7, 1987 issue of <ent type='ORG'>Science</ent>, no reference is made to any
article having been submitted; it is said only that "the group
recently has submitted a paper."
This seems like a minor anomaly until one realizes that for
the last seven years, <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> has been releasing announcements
to the media regarding <ent type='ORG'>the Minnesota Twins Study</ent> and its results.
The news section of <ent type='ORG'>Science</ent> has several times enthusiastically
quoted <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent>. Also since 1980, articles have appeared in
<ent type='ORG'>Science</ent> 80, <ent type='ORG'>Newsweek</ent>, The New York <ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s, the New York <ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s
Sunday Magazine, People, the <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans States</ent>-Item, the
<ent type='ORG'>Washington Post</ent>, and elsewhere. (2)
In these articles, traits from political conservatism to
toilet flushing have been claimed to be heritable. <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> has
declared his results "devastating" to feminists. (3) Opponents
have been termed "ideological." (4) U.S. News stated, "Unable to
hold back the swelling tide of evidence for the importance of
genes, supporters of the nurture side try to fight back with
words." (5)
This public trumpeting of 'science' without data is perhaps
the most extreme recent example of popular media releases without
scientific publication. Given the popular interest in <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent>'s
alleged results and their purported policy impact for child
rearing, social welfare programs, the criminal justice system,
and the schools, this situation raises questions of ethics and
responsibility. These questions relate to not only <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> and
<ent type='ORG'>the Minnesota Twin Study</ent> group in releasing these so-far
unverifiable claims. They also relate to the journalists who
uncritically convey the study's claims and the members of the
relevant subdisciplines within the scientific community who have
not raised critical notice concerning the twins study and its
media coverage. </p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Persecuted Galileos</ent>?
Doctrines of hereditary I.Q., race differences in I.Q., sex
differences in math ability, the sociobiology of aggression and
sex roles, and other aspects of biological determinism have
flooded the media. In these media presentations, hereditarians
play a double game. On the one hand, they claim to be 'pure
scientists,' above the political battle. On the other hand, they
are not shy in hyping their doctrines to the popular press, and
have never, to my knowledge, criticized a favorable presentation
of sociobiological doctrine, no matter how vulgar and distorted
it may be.
The biological determinists often present themselves as
persecuted Galileos of science. But they do not hesitate to make
policy pronouncements on such topics as the inferiority of black
intelligence, the inability of women to pursue careers in science
and the law, the ineffectiveness of attempts to educate the
disadvantaged, or the 'naturalness' of female depression, rape,
capitalism, and war. (6) However, biological determinists tend to
claim that their own views are purely scientific, while their
opponents' views are purely ideological.
<ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent>, his co-workers, and supporters follow this
pattern. According to <ent type='ORG'>Science</ent>, "<ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> wants to keep his study
free from politics." But in the same article, <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> is also
quoted as saying that his <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> twins are "devastating to the
feminist contention that children's personalities are shaped
differently according to the sex of those who rear them, since
<ent type='PERSON'>Oskar</ent> was raised by women and <ent type='PERSON'>Jack</ent> by men." (3) Thus, in a sample
of one pair of twins, <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> is willing to draw conclusions
concerning child rearing and sexual politics.
Many biological determinists portray themselves as liberals
who were brought by the 'harsh facts' of biology to hold
conservative doctrines. <ent type='NORP'>Sociobiologist</ent> E.O. <ent type='ORG'>Wilson</ent>, psychologist
of inherited criminality <ent type='PERSON'>Sanford Mednick</ent>, and others have made
this claim.
<ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> is no exception. Despite his discipleship to the
scientific racist <ent type='PERSON'>Arthur Jensen</ent> at <ent type='GPE'>Berkeley</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> claims to
have been engaged in "political activism in the radical
sixties." (7) <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> also presents himself as having stumbled
"almost casually" in 1979 into an interest in twins through
reading about a pair of reunited twins. (8)
In fact, <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> had already published research and review
articles years before on the heritability of I.Q. From this work
and that of his mentor, <ent type='ORG'>Jensen</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> must have realized the
centrality of studies of twins reared apart for the I.Q. debate.
This importance greatly increased after <ent type='PERSON'>Cyril Burt</ent>'s data, a
major basis for <ent type='ORG'>Jensen</ent>'s claims concerning black/white I.Q.
differences, was discredited as fraudulent. (910) Inferences
From Coincidences
Despite the claims concerning hard evidence, large samples,
and the appeal to the biological sciences, what we find in
statements by <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> and in material released to the media from
<ent type='ORG'>the Minnesota Twin Study</ent> are anecdotes and amazing stories. What
is striking about the anecdotal material is its similarity to the
sort of evidence often offered as proof for astrology or
extrasensory perception (ESP).
Striking coincidences are reported as supposed grounds for
belief in the phenomenon itself. In literature about astrology
and ESP, cases where forecasts came true or where thought of a
friend was immediately followed by a phone call from that friend
are offered as evidence. The cases where forecasts failed or
where a thought of someone is not followed by a phone call from
that person are forgotten or left unmentioned.
<ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent>'s coincidence anecdotes are of a similar nature:
we are told about the similarities (seven rings on fingers,
sneezing in elevators) but not about the differences. But some of
the similarities are physical ones that are to be expected in
identical twins. Other behavioral similarities are not all that
amazing.
Two twins living east and west of the <ent type='GPE'>Mississippi</ent> turn out
later to live on opposite sides of the river in <ent type='GPE'>Louisiana</ent>. Even
if "the mighty <ent type='GPE'>Mississippi</ent> divided" the twins, the fact that they
both wear cowboy hats and like hunting is not that unusual for
two working-class men in the same region of <ent type='GPE'>Louisiana</ent>.11
<ent type='PERSON'>Oskar</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Jack</ent>, the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent> -- superficially the most
spectacular case of twins reared apart -- both had less
isolation from each other and less different environments than
the media stories reveal. They were raised by their own relatives
in two <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> households. One of these households emigrated to
<ent type='GPE'>Trinidad</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> himself admits that their household
environments were more similar than their <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>-vs.-<ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent> image
suggests. In fact, the two men met briefly during the 1950s in
<ent type='GPE'>Germany</ent>, and their wives kept up correspondence since that
meeting. (11)
<ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> notes that one function of the media publicity
about spectacular coincidences is to recruit more pairs of twins.
But such pairs may wish to exaggerate similarities of behavior or
wear identical dress to receive publicity and scientific approval
for themselves. This sort of recruitment bias has occurred in
some earlier twin studies.
Some of the coincidences recalled can have nothing to do
with the twins' genetics, such as twins being adopted by
families which had adoptive brothers with the same name or the
twins themselves being given the same name by their adoptive
families. (12)
Even the language of twin study reportage is similar to
that concerning the occult. One of <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent>'s co-workers says
that they were still "bewitched by the seven rings." (13)
<ent type='ORG'>Discover</ent> magazine's front cover introduces us to "<ent type='ORG'>The Eerie World</ent>
of Reunited Twins."
While admitting that "Genes do not cause fires," one popular
book entitled Twins: Nature's Amazing Mystery moves easily
between enthusiastic reports of <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent>'s coincidences and
discussions of telepathic communication between twins and
synchronous events such as fires in the lives of distant twins.
(15) The anecdotes that <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> relates would seem more at home
on the pages of <ent type='ORG'>the National Enquirer</ent> than in those of <ent type='ORG'>Science</ent>.
It is ironic that <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent>, in his reviews of the critics of
the twin studies, dismisses their work as ad hoc and
unscientific. (14) In reviewing <ent type='PERSON'>Howard Gardner</ent>'s criticism of
I.Q. tests, <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> says. "This book is primarily an opinion
piece, a collection of anecdotes... <ent type='PERSON'>Gardner</ent>'s scheme is not,
however, a theory in the rigorous (or even the non-rigorous)
scientific sense." (14) This remark is particularly ironic since
all that <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> has so far released are anecdotes of strange
coincidences that "struck" him.
Given that the largest study of identical twins reared
apart fraudulent by even <ent type='ORG'>Burt</ent>'s students and admirers, and that
earlier studies of twins are replete with tester and surveyor
bias,15 it would seem especially desirable that <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> and the
<ent type='GPE'>Minnesota</ent> group open to public scientific scrutiny their data and
experimental design. However, all we have in the popular reports
are assertions of the heritable nature of various traits and
anecdotes concerning a few of the twin pairs.
The only paper in a refereed journal which makes use of the
<ent type='GPE'>Minnesota</ent> Twin Study data is a study of homosexuality in twins
reared apart. (16) This study relies on the huge data base of six
pairs of twins -- four pairs of females and two pairs of males.
Both members of one of the male pairs are gay. Only one member of
the other male pair is gay. Of the four pairs of female twins,
only one member each is lesbian or bisexual and one member each
is heterosexual.
From these results, <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> and McGue conclude that male
homosexuality has a strong heritable component, while lesbianism
does not. That such a grand conclusion can be drawn from this
sample of two gay male twins is even more mind-boggling than some
of the coincidences that <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> relates.
The <ent type='ORG'>Science</ent> review of earlier I.Q. correlation studies 11
and the study on the heritability of homosexuality are the only
articles in peer-reviewed journals closely relevant to or based
upon the twin study material.
A central feature of science is its public and critical
nature. Scientific data, unlike the lore and traditions of some
religious cults or such esoteric practices as alchemy, are made
publicly available in journals whose contents are reviewed,
evaluated, and published by members of the scientific community.
<ent type='ORG'>Peer</ent> review is meant to subject articles to critical scrutiny
prior to being accepted as worthy of publication. Despite the
fact that peer review does not always function to ideal
effectiveness, it is better than outright cronyism or nepotism.
Once the scientific article has been deemed worthy of
publication by a group of fellow scientists, the publicly
available account of data and methods is available to the entire
scientific community for further examination and criticism.
Methods of data collection, sources of sample populations,
statistical techniques. and the logic by which conclusions are
drawn can be carefully analyzed and criticized by other
scientists.
The failure of <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> and his colleagues in the <ent type='GPE'>Minnesota</ent>
Twin Study to participate in the peer review process is an
extreme example of circumventing the scientific process and using
the media for public relations. But scientists in competitive
fields such as high-energy physics, genetic engineering and
medicine have also announced their discoveries to the press
before they are published in the organs of the scientific
community. Editors of <ent type='ORG'>the New England Journal</ent> of Medicine and
Physical Review Letters have complained about this practice, (17)
and have tried to discipline scientists who publish in the
popular press before their work is refereed by other scientists
through refusal of publication in their journals.
For seven years, <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> and the <ent type='GPE'>Minnesota</ent> group have been
announcing their 'conclusions' concerning the heritable nature of
personality traits. They have been relating anecdotes of
coincidences to convince the general public that subtle
characteristics such as "beringedness" (wearing rings) have
heritable predispositions and that complex behaviors, such as
double toilet-flushing, sneezing in elevators, and naming one's
dog Toy, are relatively independent of upbringing and
environment.
Most recently, the <ent type='GPE'>Minnesota</ent> group has released a list of
group's representatives have also expounded on such topics as the
heritable nature of <ent type='PERSON'>Chuck Yeager</ent>'s bravery (although Yeager is
not known to be a subject of their survey). (18)
It is possible that <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent>'s survey is exhaustive and his
logic impeccable. But as long as <ent type='ORG'>the Minnesota Twin Study</ent> does
not publish its data and the methodological basis for its
conclusions in a peer review journal, we cannot tell. To
investigate the background, upbringing, and circumstances of
recruitment for the twins involved in <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent>'s research, a
book-length study would first have to be released. The <ent type='ORG'>Discover</ent>
article promises such a book by 1989, but by the time critical
evaluations are published by scientists, a decade of media
coverage will have made its impression.
The media anecdotes about "eerie" and "freakish"
coincidences that "struck" <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> must remain on a par with
tales about astrology and ESP. And <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent>'s data and methods
must remain in that limbo in which <ent type='PERSON'>Cyril Burt</ent>'s imaginary
assistants and unverifiable data existed.</p>

eulogist at <ent type='ORG'>Burt</ent>'s funeral and "official" biographer of <ent type='ORG'>Burt</ent>, was
only reluctantly led to his conclusions that <ent type='ORG'>Burt</ent> invented both
data and research assistants. <ent type='PERSON'>Leon Kamin</ent> (The <ent type='ORG'>Science</ent> and
Politics of I.Q., 1974) had already raised doubts about <ent type='ORG'>Burt</ent>'s
data.
Interestingly, the only person who by 1980 still seemed to
have doubts that <ent type='ORG'>Burt</ent>'s data were fraudulent was <ent type='ORG'>Science</ent>
journalist <ent type='PERSON'>Constance Holden</ent>, author of three articles in praise
of <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>Science</ent> 80, Nov 1980, and <ent type='ORG'>Science</ent>, vol. 207, 1980,
to cite two).</p>

<p>10. A look at <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent>'s previous publications in psychology
does not increase one's trust in the so-far-unpublished twin
data. <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> and McGue's "<ent type='ORG'>Familial Studies</ent> of Intelligence: A
Review," (<ent type='ORG'>Science</ent>, vol 212, 1981) reviews previous studies of
correlations of I.Q. among relatives, omitting <ent type='ORG'>Burt</ent>'s discredited
studies. This article is obviously meant to show that despite the
loss of <ent type='ORG'>Burt</ent>'s supposed data, there is a large body of work on
which hereditarians can base their assertions.
The survey has many faults. One is that <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> and McGue
do not mention or bother to deal with the faults already found
in the early studies that they resurrect (dating back to the
1920s, and largely from the 1930s and 40s). Many of these studies
were biased in their methodology and reported as "separated from
birth" twins who actually lived next door to one another,
attended the same school, played together, and had frequent
social interaction.
These studies are also vitiated by neglecting to correct for
the age bias in I.Q. tests. Despite the fact that I.Q. is
supposedly corrected for age, the I.Q. tests used in these
studies show I.Q. rising with age. Thus, part of the weaker
correlation between nontwin siblings than between twins arises
from the fact that twins are exactly the same age, while other
siblings may differ in age.
Finally, <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> and McGue simply pooled the samples from
very different tests and from tests which gave extraordinarily
divergent results. For instance, one test of siblings gave an
I.Q. correlation of 10 percent, while another test gave a
correlation of 90 percent. <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> and McGue simply averaged the
two to give a correlation of 50 percent. Given the radically
opposite results of the two surveys, it is likely that they were
performed with radically different biases and methodologies. They
could not have been randomly sampling two subpopulations of the
same homogeneous population of data -- a basic requirement for
drawing valid statistical inference.</p>

<p>Sidebar: "Financing Racist Research"</p>

<p> The first New York <ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s report about the <ent type='GPE'>Minnesota</ent> Twin
study quoted <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> as saying, "I'm going to beg, borrow, and
steal" to pursue the twin study. In fact, <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> has solicited
money from the <ent type='ORG'>Pioneer Fund</ent>, a foundation with racist and radical
right-wing connections. <ent type='ORG'>the University</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Minnesota</ent> has received
grants from the fund for <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent>'s twin study. Butthe Pioneer
Fund is best known for its support of research purpoting the
inferiority of blacks.
Once headed by directors such as the Chairman of the House
Committee on UnAmerican Activities, Representative Francis E.
Walter, and <ent type='GPE'>Mississippi</ent> Senator <ent type='PERSON'>James</ent> O. <ent type='ORG'>Eastland</ent>, the fund has
long subsidized research and publication of the works of
scientific racists, including <ent type='PERSON'>William Shockley</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Arthur Jensen</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'>Jensen</ent> served on the scientific advisory board of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> Neo-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> journal <ent type='PERSON'>Newe Anthropologie</ent>. (SeeBarry <ent type='PERSON'>Mehler</ent>'s article "The
New Eugenics" in the May/June 1983 issue of _<ent type='ORG'>Science</ent> for the
People_.)
The <ent type='ORG'>Pioneer Fund</ent> financed the work of <ent type='PERSON'>Roger Pearson</ent>, quthor
of _Eugenics and Race_. <ent type='ORG'>Pearson</ent> also helped organize the 1978
World Anti-Communist League meeting in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C. The
League has united old <ent type='NORP'>European</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s with leaders of Third World
death squads.
<ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent>, in his grant application to the <ent type='ORG'>Pioneer Fund</ent>,
noted that the National <ent type='ORG'>Science</ent> Foundation has repeatedly refused
funding for his study and has made numerous criticisms of his
method. <ent type='ORG'>Bouchard</ent> has claimed that the <ent type='ORG'>NSF</ent> and the National
Institutes of Health are packed with left liberals who deny him
funds on ideological grounds.</p>

<p> [Additional Commentary by <ent type='PERSON'>Brian Siano</ent>: In fairness to the
<ent type='ORG'>Pioneer Fund</ent>, they also provided some funding for _The Atomic
Cafe_, a savagely funny documentary about the ridiculous claims
on the harmlessness of nuclear war circulated in the 1950s. It's
hard to call this film 'right wing.'
[As for the comments on the World Anti-Communist League,
they're certainly true; the <ent type='NORP'>WACL</ent> was even condemned by the John
Birch society as being too fanatical. A good resource on this
organization (which has numbered <ent type='PERSON'>Roberto</ent> D'Aubuisson, Rev. Sun
<ent type='PERSON'>Myung Moon</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Ferdinand Marcos</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>John Singlaub</ent> as its members) is
_Inside The League_, by <ent type='PERSON'>Scott Anderson</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Jon Lee Anderson</ent>.
[<ent type='PERSON'>Roger Pearson</ent> deserves a study by himself. Many of his
books (some still sold my the American <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> Party) argue classic
racist themes, mainly against the dilution of <ent type='ORG'>the white race</ent>'s
genetic stock through intermarriage with blacks and <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s. _Inside
the League_ provides a quick thumbnail study of <ent type='ORG'>Pearson</ent>'s views
and activities.]
