<ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
There is criticism on the part of the media to opening up the
<ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> F. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> assassination to a new investigation. However,
there are individuals who are willing to challenge this stance.
They feel that there are more than enough reasons to open up
<ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> findings and to take another look;
even to convene another impartial group of researchers and
investigators who have subpoena power; even a special prosecutor,
if necessary, to delve into this issue without the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> and the
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> being the ones who are primarily responsible for giving the
information, as some doubt has been raised concerning their
objectivity in the original <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent> hearings and
research-gathering. </p>

<p>Our first guest on today's program is <ent type='PERSON'>Harold Weisberg</ent>, the
House Subcommitee on <ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent> investigator, the author
of a book on <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent> and the post-mortem, the whitewash
and the frame-up. He has also written a book on the assassination
of <ent type='PERSON'>Martin Luther King</ent>. Welcome to our program, Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Weisberg</ent>.
I would like you to give us your professional assessment of the
House Select <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> on <ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent> -- since you were a
primary investigator there -- on their findings, on the <ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent>, and on ....</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>HAROLD WEISBERG</ent>:
I had no connection with the <ent type='ORG'>House Committee</ent>. I was the source
for most of the stories that appeared that were critical of them.
It was a synthetic duplication of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>. It began
with the intent (now, I'm not talking about each individual
member. I'm talking about the staff who did it; especially
<ent type='PERSON'>Blakey</ent>, the general counsel and chief-of-staff) .... It began
with the intent of putting down all the critics. Each hearing
-- each public hearing -- began with what he called "the
narration", and he picked out the critics whose work he was
going to address, and then the hearing was dedicated to debunking
them and proving them wrong. And I'm happy to say that there's
only one critic he managed to avoid; and that's me. He wasn't
going to pick a fight with me.</p>

<p>All of their [the Committee's] work was faulted in varying
degrees of ways, but they NEVER investigated the crime itself.
In that, they did exactly what the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> did, and exactly what
<ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> did. They did NOT -- any one of them --
investigate the crime itself.</p>

<p>Now, I think you should know that, unlike the other books,
there are no theories in my book. I'm a former investigative
reporter, a Senate investigator, an intelligence analyst; and
that's not my bag. And I don't think that that's what the people
of the country need for the democratic system to work. They're
factual. Now, I'm going to quote, <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>urately from memory, a
record I got through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.
Perhaps it would help your audience to understand more about
where I'm coming from to say that I filed about a dozen Freedom
of Information Act lawsuits against the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>. Most of them
are on the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> assassination. And most of the records I got
were from the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>. In all, I have about a third of a million
pages of records. These are the same ones that <ent type='PERSON'>Oliver Stone</ent> has
been promoting for himself in his movie by saying that they're
suppressed. </p>

<p>Now, from <ent type='ORG'>the Department</ent> of Justice and from the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> I got a
record of a memorandum. <ent type='PERSON'>Nicholas Katzenabach</ent> -- who was then
the Deputy Attorney-General of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States and acting
Attorney-General as of the time in question, because <ent type='PERSON'>Bobby</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was not there because of the crime and the tragedy.
He [<ent type='PERSON'>Katzenbach</ent>] wrote <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lyndon</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent></ent>, through his [Johnson's]
channel, <ent type='PERSON'>Bill Moyers</ent>, recommending to <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lyndon</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent></ent> that they
had to convince the country that <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> was alone, that <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>
was the assassin, that he had no confederates who were still
at-large, and that the evidence was such that he would be
convicted in trial. The typed copy is dated early Monday morning
the first working day after the assassination, November 25, 1963.
I also happen to have gotten Katzenbach's handwritten copy, which
he wrote when he had no typist available on <ent type='LOC'>Sunday</ent>. And from the
<ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> I got a record which said that <ent type='PERSON'>Katzenbach</ent> had discussed it
with [<ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> Director] <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent> on <ent type='LOC'>Sunday</ent>, as soon as <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> was killed. </p>

<p>So as soon as the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> knew that there would be no trial of
<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent>, they closed the books, the crime was solved, and
that was it. So you see, when the crime itself was never
investigated, there are no leads for other people to follow. And I
address this so that your audience can understand that those
people, who develop theories and advance them as solutions, do it
without a factual basis. I don't know of any theory that is
factually supportable by the known evidence. And now I'm talking
about the official investigative reports of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> and things
like that which do establish some fact.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay, we thank you very much, Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Weisberg</ent>, for sharing your
views and for giving us this insight on this important piece of
critical information. I appreciate your being on with us today.
Let's go now to another guest who is standing by, who has a
different point of view, and who has additional information.
I would like to invite <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Marrs</ent> [author of CROSSFIRE] onto our
program again. Welcome to our program, <ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent>. </p>

<p>I'd like to pick up where we left off yesterday. For those of you
who were not here yesterday and who didn't hear the program, we did
a careful assessment, going step-by-step through the events that
led up to the actual shooting, showing that <ent type='ORG'>the American Public</ent>
has never been made aware of the fact that earlier in the day, in
<ent type='GPE'>Fort Worth</ent>, there was also a motorcade for President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>, but
that motorcade was substantially different. It was VERY very
heavily guarded, on proper protocol, by <ent type='ORG'>the Secret Service</ent>. And the
police were maintained, meaning that sharpshooters were stationed on
rooftops, no window was allowed to be opened, there was adequate
protection. But all of that was suspended at Dealey Plaza and for
the trip through <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. WHY? <ent type='ORG'>WHO</ent> was responsible? Who caused
the rescinding of these orders? Those are questions that have to
be thoroughly analyzed.</p>

<p>I would like just a brief summary of some of the points from
yesterday -- an overview of some of the discrepancies between
what we have been led to believe and what actually occurred.
Then I would like to go into the area that our previous guest,
Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Harold Weisberg</ent> has suggested -- that there is NO evidence
to support any of the assassination theories. I would like you to
give us YOUR information, your belief, and whatever documentation
you have that could, in any way, directly or indirectly, tie in
any of a number of proposed agendas such as the renegade <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
agents, the knowledge that <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> director J. Edgar <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent> could
have known or may have known in advance that the assassination
was imminent, certain right-wing extremists, certain members of
the military, and also members of <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent>, and some
anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent>.</p>

<p>Now, all of these have been alleged -- depending upon the theorist
-- to have participated. But you have some unique insights and
and I would like you to share with us some of those insights at
this time.

JIM MARRS [author of CROSSFIRE]:
Well, first just let me say that the one thing I think that
everyone including Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Weisberg</ent>, including <ent type='PERSON'>Gerald Ford</ent>, including
<ent type='PERSON'>David Bigeley</ent>(?), including everybody who is connected with this
thing at this point .... I think the one thing that we can all
agree on is that there is substantial controversy over the death
of President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> and over the subsequent investigation and
the medical evidence. Now, in this particular case, that
confusion, that controversy, that obfuscation, if you will, is
the basis of what can legitimately be called "the cover-up".
There should not have been a cover-up. There should not have been
this confusion. This was a case .... this was the President of
<ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States, for God's sake. There was an autopsy at
<ent type='ORG'>Bethesda Naval Hospital</ent>. There was treatment at a reputable
hospital: <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent>, in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. And there should not be this
confusion. There should be some very clear-cut answers based on
scientific, medical, forensic evidence to say: "Here's what
happened. He was shot three times from the rear." Or: "He was
shot once from the front and once from the rear." It should be
very clear, but it's NOT. It is TOTALLY muddled. It is TOTALLY in
confusion. And THAT is the nature of this cover-up. Not that
there has never been any information, but that there has been so
much information, and so much CONTRADICTORY information that it
has thrown the whole thing into confusion and controvery, so that
we can't seem to get to the bottom of this. I think that is very
self-evident. </p>

<p>Now, who has the power to do that? And who CAN do that? And who
could have saved us from all of this? The <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>!
The <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> who supposedly had him autopsied. The <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>
who supposedly is in charge of the investigation. It should have
been clear-cut, but it's not. And, to me, that shows, in an
overview, that the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> has been responsible for all this
confusion, rather than clearing it up and actually presenting us
with factual information as to what happened. So this is what is
causing all of the problems, because the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> is <ent type='ORG'>STILL</ent>
saying: "Well, there's nothing there. It's all cut and dried."
And yet, it's not. </p>

<p>You can look at the evidence for yourself. For instance, in the
medical evidence, I could go down the whole list of doctors in
<ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> who said that he had a large gaping hole in the right rear
portion of his head. Even <ent type='PERSON'>Clint Hill</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>the Secret Service</ent> agent
who jumped up on the back of the car in a vain effort to save his
life; in his <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent> testimony he says, quite bluntly,
quite to the point: "The right rear portion of his head was
missing." End-quote. Okay? How much clearer do you want to be?
And every doctor in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> backed him up. Doctor <ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent> says that
there was a large defect in the back side of his head. Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Perry</ent>
said: "I noted a large evulsive wound in the right
parieto-occipital area." I could go on and on and on. They all
said the same thing: that there was a gaping hole in the right
rear portion of his head. But today, we have an autopsy
photograph that has come out of the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> that purports to
show the back of President Kennedy's head, and there's no large
gaping hole there. All there is is a small hole that <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> told us was an entrance wound. And yet, the autopsy
doctor, Dr. <ent type='ORG'>Humes</ent>, in his testimony to the <ent type='ORG'>House Committee</ent> said:
"Well, I don't know what that was, but that wasn't any wound of
entrance. And I know that for sure." Okay? So what's going on
here? I mean, the confusion points the finger at what REALLY is
going on, and at who is generating all this. And it's the <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>!</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright, so let's take a look here. You're suggesting that the
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>, or various members of different areas of the
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> have participated in a systematic cover-up.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Absolutely! For instance, <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> tells us -- and
the people who defend <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> to this very day tell
us -- that one of the shots (it started off that it was the first
shot. Now they're backing up by saying: Well, maybe it was the
second one or the third one) .... but one of the shots, they say,
went through Kennedy's neck and did not hit anything. It went on
to strike Governor Connally, causing all of his wounds --
which has become known as "the single bullet theory"; this idea
that one bullet went through both men. This is the foundation of
the "single assassin theory". Okay? If you don't have one bullet
going through two men, then you've got more bullets, which means
more shooters, which means a conspiracy involving more than one
gunman. So to keep from having to admit that, they came up with
the "single bullet theory" which says that one bullet went
through Kennedy's neck and struck Connally. </p>

<p>Now, the problem is that the bullet did not go through his neck.
The <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent> plainly states that it hit him in the
middle of the back -- the third thoracic vertebrae, between the
shoulder blades. Doctor <ent type='ORG'>Humes</ent> places it there in the
<ent type='PERSON'>Siebert</ent>-O'<ent type='PERSON'>Neill</ent> <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> Report of the autopsy. His jacket and his
shirt, in the <ent type='ORG'>National Archives</ent>, show a bullet hole in the middle
of the back. Well, if there's a bullet hole in the middle of the
back, and you try to track that to the throat wound -- which is
what they do -- now you've got an upward trajectory, which
destroys the idea that this bullet somehow cursed downward and
struck Governor Connally. Plus, you've got Governor Connally's
wrist X-ray, which shows that there are still more pieces of
bullet in his wrist today than are missing off of the bullet that
the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> still claims caused the wound. So it's very
obvious that they're simply lying about what went on.</p>

<p>We now have the January 27th minutes of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>, in
which their Chief Counsel admits that since we have a picture of
where the bullet entered the back, that it's below the place
where it came out the front. So how could it go and turn around,
etc.? They knew it, and so they chose to lie to us and simply
claim that the bullet went through his neck. And the supporters
of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> are still telling us the same thing,
although this is totally opposite to what the medical evidence
shows us.
</p>
<p>
So it's a huge thing. You have to look at the totality of this
case. Any one particular issue can be picked apart or explained
away or rationalized as coincidence or happenstance, but if you
look at the total picture, you can begin to get an understanding
of what really went on.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright, <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Marrs</ent>, I want you to hold on, because we're going to
present some new information. By the way, <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Marrs</ent> is an award-winning reporter for the <ent type='GPE'>Fort Worth</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Star</ent>-Telegram, and he was a
reporter at the time of the assassination for the Denton Record-Chronicle. He teaches at <ent type='ORG'>the University</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> at <ent type='GPE'>Arlington</ent>.

please assist in disseminating it by posting it to other

<ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Now, just today -- just less than an hour ago -- <ent type='ORG'>the American</ent>
Medical Association gave it's official position on the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>
assassination, and a Doctor <ent type='PERSON'>George Lundberg</ent>, the editor of the
Journal of <ent type='ORG'>the American</ent> Medical Association and Editor-in-Chief
of <ent type='ORG'>Scientific Publications</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>JAMA</ent>, read their position paper,
and I'll just quote something from it. Later in the show we're
going to come back to this, because we have a part of the press
conference recorded by <ent type='ORG'>WBAI</ent>. It says: </p>

<p> "The recent <ent type='PERSON'>Crenshaw</ent> book"
(and we had Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Crenshaw</ent> on the show)
"is a sad fabrication based upon unsubstantiated allegations. The best
explanation for the motivations of myriad conspiracy theorists are
paranoia, the desire for personal recognition, public visibility and profit.</p>

<p>Anyhow, it says that this is all nonsense. There was no
conspiracy; that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> was right. And THAT was
the press conference. We'll get more on the press conference, but
I just want you to know that finally <ent type='ORG'>JAMA</ent> (and I don't know why
<ent type='ORG'>JAMA</ent> would be sticking it's nose into something that it knows
nothing about, to begin with) came out and felt the need to hold
a press conference to say that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> was right.
Everyone (they say) in the field writing books, doing broadcasts,
or offering information to the public, must be doing it for profit,
recognition or some other [personal] motive. </p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
I've got news for them. Talk to anybody who has known me and
they'll tell you that I've been making the same criticisms since
the early '70s, and I certainly never made any money. In fact,
people ....</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
<ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent>, let me ask you something. Have you ever been found guilty, in
an extended trial, of restraint of trade, monopolistic practices,
and, if so, was that conviction upheld all the way clear up to
all the different appeals courts, and now the conviction is
final?</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Not me.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Well that has happened to <ent type='ORG'>the American</ent> Medical Association. So,
when the <ent type='ORG'>AMA</ent> has the audacity to come onto a press conference --
with the muddled background that they have for having been caught
engaging in the restraint of trade and in monopolistic practices
-- claiming that others have ulterior motives, I think it's
absolutely absurd.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Anybody who knows anything knows that the <ent type='ORG'>AMA</ent> is a FIRM supporter
of the status quo, and that it has been highly political for
years. And I would ascribe political motives to almost anything
that they do. The point that I want to make here is -- if my
understanding is correct -- if they are simply quoting from the
two autopsy doctors who worked on President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>, well then,
this is just an affirmation [of that autopsy]. Of course, those
doctors are going to say the same things they said in 1963 and
1964, and it's going to support <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>'s
contention. But this is a diversion. This is a red herring. This
is not the issue. The issue is that what the autopsy doctors saw
was not the same as what the doctors saw [at <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent> Hospital]
in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. And there is a very DEEP discrepancy between the
wounds as viewed in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> .... I just quoted you all these
people who said that there was a large hole in the back of his
head. This was not seen at the autopsy -- or not reported. So
we've got some real discrepancies here, and this particular
little news conference and their pronouncements are simply
skirting the issue.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay, <ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent>, I want you to hold on because we're going to introduce
some new evidence and a new individual to our conference here.
He is <ent type='PERSON'>Harrison Edward Livingstone</ent>, the author of HIGH TREASON II.
Welcome to our program, Mr. Livingstone.</p>

<p>HARRISON <ent type='ORG'>LIVINGSTONE</ent>:
Thanks for inviting me.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
I would like to go straight to some of the most important issues,
and if you would, please give us the research that you have
uncovered on these. First, I would like to have you review, from
your perspective, the eyewitness descriptions of Kennedy's real
wounds.</p>

<p>HARRISON <ent type='ORG'>LIVINGSTONE</ent>:
Well, as you know, I've been able to interview almost every
living medical witness. I did not talk to Doctor <ent type='PERSON'>Clark</ent>, although
he gave me certain answers through his secretary, twelve years
ago. I have talked to Doctor <ent type='ORG'>Humes</ent>, but I can't say that anything
was productive there, even after as much as an hour of talk.
But, other than that, my book presents the most complete history
of what these doctors are saying today, and put in perspective of
what they said and wrote in 1963. No other book or writer or
researcher has achiveved this.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
We're not here to promote your book, as such. We're here for you
to please share your information with us. So if you could, please
go right to the information. Would you talk about the evidence of
forgery and retouching of the autopsy photographs and X-rays?</p>

<p>HARRISON <ent type='ORG'>LIVINGSTONE</ent>:
[initial words were drowned out by <ent type='PERSON'>Gary Null</ent>'s voice]
.... doctors and the two autopsies. And the point being that they
are trying to head off at the pass the research that I have just
published, and for no other reason; also [they're targeting] Doctor
Crenshaw's book and his statements. They made a number of totally
false statements at this press conference. For instance, that
<ent type='PERSON'>Crenshaw</ent> (they quoted other doctors, and this is an example of how
they cooked their article by <ent type='ORG'>the American</ent> Medical Association) ....
that <ent type='PERSON'>Crenshaw</ent> was not present at the autopsy -- when if you go and
read in Volume Six of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> books, he is mentioned
by almost every doctor as having been there. And he was certainly
in a position to observe the wounds and to see what was going on.
And it doesn't take anybody more than an idiot to know that a
bullet is either an entry hole through the skin of the neck, or
it's an exit, because, if it's coming out, it's going to make
quite a tear. And anybody, basically, would see the difference.
I was pretty stunned, as you probably know, because I was at this
press conference today. You ask: Why is <ent type='ORG'>JAMA</ent> [<ent type='ORG'>the Journal</ent> of the
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Medical Association] doing this at this time, and I'm
just telling you there is only one reason why they're doing it.
It's because the whole cover-up perpetrated by the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> in
this case is directly threatened by the research that I have done
and by my making it possible for <ent type='PERSON'>Crenshaw</ent> and the other doctors
to come forward.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. Would you give us some link between <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Nixon</ent>'s men
and <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Kennedy's killers that ties the assassination directly
to <ent type='EVENT'>Watergate</ent>? And could you please give us the facts?

HARRISON <ent type='ORG'>LIVINGSTONE</ent>:
Before I get to that, you had asked me a question on this medical
evidence. Do you recall?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Yes. I asked you for the evidence of forgery and retouching in
the autopsy photographs and X-rays.</p>

<p>HARRISON <ent type='ORG'>LIVINGSTONE</ent>:
This is my special area of research. I discovered that the X-rays
were fake in that they show the entire face missing on the right
side. And again, this is what <ent type='ORG'>JAMA</ent> tried to head off at the press
conference today. They tried to ridicule criticism of the medical
evidence without facing these facts. And I asked them at the
press conference: "Didn't you notice that the face is missing --
that the President's face is missing in the X-rays, but it's NOT
missing in the photographs?" And, of course, at that point, the
press conference became tumultuous, and the whole thing began to
be overturned. The photographs, of course, show extensive
retouching and evidence of forgery. And this was directly how the
Chief Justice of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States was tricked -- with this faked
evidence. The doctors, most recently (quite a few that <ent type='ORG'>JAMA</ent> did
not interview, and they don't dare interview, and if they did,
like other researchers, they're not going to report it) ....
because those doctors insist, to this day, that that throat wound
WAS an entry hole. And the many people who were at the autopsy
.... and Doctor <ent type='PERSON'>Fink</ent>, the forensic pathologist who was at the
autopsy, who was not interviewed by <ent type='ORG'>JAMA</ent>, and whom they claimed
declined, and I've talked to him. But he testified that the hole
in the back was an entry hole that did not penetrate into the
chest. So what <ent type='ORG'>JAMA</ent> did -- and as <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Marrs</ent> just said: They're a
political action committee that doesn't dare let this evidence
link up because .... they've kept it compartmentalized. I asked
them: "What about Doctor Humes's stating at the end of his
testimony to <ent type='PERSON'>Arlen Specter</ent> that the bullet that hit <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Connally
could not possibly have been the same bullet that went through
<ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> because of the fragments that were found in Connally?"
They said: "We did not discuss <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Connally in this article.
It's not relevant." So that's an example of compartmentalizing
the evidence by a political action committee which has sought
to control the medical community in this country.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay. Let's try to go back to the photographs. And please, if
you would, try to keep .... we have limited time and we want the
opportunity for you to give us as much information as you can.
Let's go specifically to the fraud that you are asserting, and
on the retouching of the photographs that no one else in the media
has picked up on.</p>

<p>HARRISON <ent type='ORG'>LIVINGSTONE</ent>:
Right. This is the key to the case, right now. The Chief Justice,
<ent type='PERSON'>Earl Warren</ent> (and he mentions in his memoirs that he was shown
autopsy photographs) [said] that he was tricked by phony
photographs and X-rays which apparently show a shot that came from
behind. They claim that there is an entry hole in the area of the
cowlick, although the autopsists, Doctors <ent type='ORG'>Humes</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Boswell</ent>, told
the committee of doctors at <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> of Representatives that
they denied .... He said: I defy you to see this hole here where
you say it is; that this is not a hole. It's something else. And
it was four inches -- as the <ent type='PERSON'>Clark</ent> Panel found in 1968 -- from
where that entry hole was placed in the autopsy report by Doctor
<ent type='ORG'>Humes</ent> and Doctor <ent type='PERSON'>Boswell</ent>. It was four inches above it. Then,
showing the face missing in the X-rays and not showing Earl
<ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> the photographs that showed the President's face intact
made him think that his face was blown away. And that's what we
see in the <ent type='PERSON'>Zapruder</ent> film. And I believe that that's animated.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay, let's go to some specific references. I'm looking now at a
photograph of <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>. It's called "the stare of death"
photograph. And I'd like for you to talk about the reference
black triangle that appears on the right upper forehead of
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> in this photograph.</p>

<p>HARRISON <ent type='ORG'>LIVINGSTONE</ent>:
Yes, if you have a clear print of that in the negative, in the
negative there is no light whatsoever that comes through that
triangle. It's much clearer in a clear print. In my book, we were
able to do the best possible reproductions, but, of course,
they're screened and it's not that clear. But in a comparable
right profile photograph, which we publish there, you can see
what has been covered up. And they're from two DIFFERENT sets of
photographs. One, with the reference black triangle is known as
"the <ent type='ORG'>Fox</ent> set of photographs" which came into the possession of
<ent type='PERSON'>Mark Crouch</ent>, who was a friend of <ent type='ORG'>the Secret Service</ent> man, <ent type='PERSON'>James</ent> K.
<ent type='ORG'>Fox</ent>, who took the rolls of film from <ent type='ORG'>Bethesda Naval Hospital</ent> over
to be developed in the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> labs. The other set of photographs,
which were in the possession of <ent type='PERSON'>Robert Groden</ent>, show that there is
a major laceration extending into the forehead of the President.
This was NOT seen in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, but two of the autopsy doctors did
describe this laceration to me. They brought it up. I did not
bring it up. And they told me about the laceration going a half
an inch into the forehead above the right eye. That's where that
reference black triangle is. What the reasons were for covering
it up in some of those photographs are not clear to me. I can't
answer that question. All I know is that they conflict with each
other -- these two different pictures, as do many of the
photographs conflict with each other.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Also, it's very clear that the whole right side of the head is
blackened out, and only the ear is visible. That is CLEARLY
retouching.</p>

<p>HARRISON <ent type='ORG'>LIVINGSTONE</ent>:
That's it. And the whole back of the head, extending around
behind to the right ear was missing. And a major part of my
research was to try to resolve the puzzles of the medical
evidence. Exactly what did the wounds look like? I was able to
determine -- by having the doctors and the witnesses at the
autopsy and in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> draw on mannequin heads -- exactly where
the bone defect was and how much scalp was missing. And they are
identical. The wound was not altered, but there was a large hole
that went all the way around to the side of the head. The autopsy
report is <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>urate in that respect, but the problem was that
there was sort of a flap of scalp that was badly macerated and it
did have an egg-shaped-sized hole through it. But it could not
possibly cover up all of the missing bone that was underneath
there. And this caused a lot of confusion among engineers and
<ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ountants and other people with that mindset who do this
research, because they can't semantically separate out the
issues, for instance, between alteration and tampering, or
between laceration and incision. A lot of the confusion in the
case (in the medical evidence) is semantic, so I was able to
determine that the body was not altered. It may have been
tampered with, but even that doesn't appear to have been
necessary when all they really had to do was to fake the
photographs and flash them at <ent type='PERSON'>Earl Warren</ent> who put them aside
immediately because of their <ent type='PERSON'>gore</ent>.

<ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright, now there are two other very VERY important issues here.
And they are that the photographs of <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Kennedy's body, where
he is on his face, lying on his stomach here, it shows ....</p>

<p>HARRISON <ent type='ORG'>LIVINGSTONE</ent>:
Lying on his back. There's no picture of him lying on his
stomach.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Oh, okay. Yeah, it's been turned around there. I have a picture
of his back, and the first bullet hole ....</p>

<p>HARRISON <ent type='ORG'>LIVINGSTONE</ent>:
He's lifted up from the table -- yes. </p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay. The first bullet hole is about four inches, it looks like,
below the ....</p>

<p>HARRISON <ent type='ORG'>LIVINGSTONE</ent>:
Well the larger hole is not the hole. It's about two inches below
that. You'll see a small red thing, closer to the roller, and
that, the men all state, was a hole. And they also indicate that
that deep depression down toward the bottom of the roller is a
bullet hole.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Yeah, well there are two bullet holes in his back. How can a man
have two bullet holes in his back, and then ....</p>

<p>HARRISON <ent type='ORG'>LIVINGSTONE</ent>:
I don't know what the answer is, but I do know that there were
gunmen all around that car. In Senator Dodd's report -- that was
appended to the <ent type='ORG'>House Committee</ent> report when he was in <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent>
of Representatives -- stated that there were at least three
gunmen firing, and two of them had to have been from behind,
because of the closeness of the shots. There ARE six shots on
that <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> [motorcycle] police tape recording.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Yeah, but you see, <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> does not state that.</p>

<p>HARRISON <ent type='ORG'>LIVINGSTONE</ent>:
No! They say that three shots were fired and two struck the
President.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Also, you have the entire back of the head shown very clearly,
and you do not see the ....</p>

<p>HARRISON <ent type='ORG'>LIVINGSTONE</ent>:
No. Part of that is not clear at all. You see the area that's out
of focus there. The background is in focus and the foreground --
where the cowlick [is] closest to the lens of the camera -- is in
focus. But the area all along the hairline from behind the ear
down to the center of the neck (in the hair) is out of focus. And
that's where they smudged all that over when they made their
composite photograph.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright, what I'd like to do is this. Let's just summarize here
for a moment. What we have are some CLEARLY retouched
photographs. We have more bullet holes in the President's body
than <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>, or any of the so-called "official"
investigations, have recognized. How in the world does a man end
up with this many proveable bullet holes, and yet, still have
one man doing all the shooting? Some of these bullet holes are
clearly exit wounds. Some are entrance wounds. And yet, the
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent> has, for whatever reason, only presented that
these were rear entrance wounds. The autopsy photographs HAVE
been altered. The X-rays HAVE been altered. It is not possible to
end up with an X-ray .... Let's say if you took a normal anterior
/posterior skull X-ray, and then you took the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> anterior/
posterior skull X-ray -- the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> lateral skull X-ray --
there's an amount of facial bone that's missing. If this were
presented in any regular forensic trial today, it would be
<ent type='ORG'>LAUGHABLE</ent>. The evidence would be thrown out as inadmissible and
faulty.</p>

<p>We're going to take a brief break. I'd like both <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Marrs</ent>
[author of CROSSFIRE] and also, our guest on the phone right now
-- who just returned from the press conference -- <ent type='PERSON'>Harris</ent>on Edward
Livingstone, who needless to say, was part of the reason that the
<ent type='ORG'>AMA</ent> called this hasty press conference (and the press conference
itself you'll hear a little later on. We tape recorded some of
it) .... we're going to get to some information that I think the
people in this audience have always wondered about. Are you aware
that not ONCE were we ever given the real reason as to why the
<ent type='EVENT'>Watergate</ent> Break-In occurred? What was in the safe they were
looking for? Why did <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> people go into that safe? Why did <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent>
authorize it? That brought down the whole <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> Administration
-- about sixty-seven of his top cronies. Why? We were never
asked that! The media never probed it further than what was
given to them.</p>

<p>Well, you're going to hear something when we come back, about the
link between <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Nixon</ent>'s men and <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Kennedy's killers that
ties the assassination directly to <ent type='EVENT'>Watergate</ent>.
(to be continued)
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p> [JD: There was an incident which remains vivid in my memory, and
it has never been explored by anyone, though it might provide
a fuller picture of the possible link between the <ent type='EVENT'>Watergate</ent>
Break-In and the assassination of President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>.</p>

<p> Those of you who are old enough will recall the numerous
Presidential press conferences of <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Nixon</ent> during which
he was interrogatively flayed and driven to the brink of
impeachment by a concerted onslaught from the press corps,
members of which have since been alleged to be journalistic
prostitutes for the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> (e.g. <ent type='PERSON'>Walter Cronkite</ent> and, I think,
<ent type='PERSON'>Dan</ent> Rather, notorious among many). In one of those press
conferences (I think it may have been the "I'm not a crook!"
press conference) a reporter asked <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> [I'm paraphrasing]:
You said something about the <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> assassination as
an example or an analogy ....
And then, <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> cut him off and exclaimed, with distress:
"No, no, no! I didn't mean to imply that I know any more
about that assassination than anyone else does."
Nixon's tenseness at this moment was striking.
Since then, I have been suspicious that <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> might have
knowledge, if not some involvement in the assassination.</p>

<p> What ought to be examined is a tape of that press
conference so that perhaps a scientific voice analysis
can be done to indicate, albeit not to prove, that <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent>
was lying about his lack of knowledge of any unreported
evidence surrounding the assassination of <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>.

If enough people wish to collaborate on such a project,
we may be able to finance the purchase of the tape and the
voice analysis with small cost to everyone involved.

We're also going to talk about proof of fraud and disinformation
campaigns WITHIN the assassination research community, and how a
United States Senator and two former Presidents personally
covered up facts in the case. And we're also going to talk about
proof that bullets WERE removed from the President's body at
<ent type='ORG'>Bethesda Naval Hospital</ent> before the autopsy began. That's just
some of what we're going to talk about today. New information;
very powerful information. And, contrary to what my first guest
suggested (and I respect that each guest can have their own point

if it differs with other people on the show) he suggested that
there was no hard data. This is as good data as can be produced.</p>

the discussion with the next day's broadcast in the series.]</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright, <ent type='PERSON'>David</ent>, if you could, please, would you go through this
evidence in some detail? You're making a lot of statements and a
a lot of allegations. We'd like you now to substantiate the
differences between the official version.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>DAVID</ent> <ent type='ORG'>LIFTON</ent></ent>:
Okay. With regard to the casket, for example, the witness who
opened the casket .... the persons who saw the casket come in the
back door of <ent type='ORG'>Bethesda Naval Hospital</ent>, and who actually unloaded
it are Dennis <ent type='PERSON'>David</ent>, the chief-of-the-day at <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> Naval
Hospital and a man named <ent type='PERSON'>Don Rabbatisch</ent> [sp] who was actually one
of the casket toters, so to speak -- who took it out of the black
hearse in which it arrived.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ount of Dennis <ent type='PERSON'>David</ent> is that he is at the back of the
hospital. He is in charge of part of the security function. He is
told that the President's body is going to arrive there. They go
down. The black hearse pulls in. He assembles some of his men.
<ent type='PERSON'>Don Rabbatisch</ent> is one of them. They bring the casket inside.
A black hearse pulls up. There's a group of plainclothesmen and
two men in O.R. smocks. They get out of the ambulance. The
shipping casket (and that's what it was: a shipping casket) is
removed from the black hearse. It is brought onto the loading
dock and it is brought to the door of the morgue. In the door of
the morgue is Paul O'Connor. He's the medical technician listed
in the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> reports, and who is also listed in the official <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent>
records, and in <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Select <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent></ent> records. He opens the
casket which is a shipping casket, <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ording to O'Connor. Inside
the shipping casket is a body bag. He unzips the body bag, puts
the President's body, along with others in the morgue, on the
table. He said that when the wrapping was removed from the head
area, there was a gasp in the room, and he said: "and I looked
down and said, 'My God, there's no brain!'" And you could see
this. It was apparent. The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>, at that time, writes notes. They
write a report that weekend. In their report, which was not
published with <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> documents, but is at the
<ent type='ORG'>National Archives</ent>, they write that when the body was removed from
the casket in which it was transported, it was (quote) "apparent
that there had been surgery to the head area; namely in the top
of the skull." And that's the official record. That's the
evidence.</p>

<p>Now, <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> did not know about most of this
evidence that I am talking about here. They did not perform this
kind of analysis. They did not establish what, in law, is called
a "chain of possession" on the body. So the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> commander who
performed the autopsy simply comes before the <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent>, raises
his right hand and testifies as to the condition of the body.
And they <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ept that autopsy report which states that President
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was shot twice from behind, based on wounds you see on
the body which were NOT on the body in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, if you compare
<ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> versus <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> -- <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> being where the President was
shot, <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> being where the autopsy was performed six hours
later. Based on the <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> wound p<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ern, President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> IS,
or appears to be, in fact, shot twice from behind. Based on the
<ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> wound p<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ern, he was NOT.</p>

<p>Now ordinarily, you would trust the autopsy over the <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ounts of
the doctors at <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, because the autopsy is better evidence.
It's, in fact, the "best evidence". It's based on the body of the
President. But the irony is that, in this case, there is a
subterfuge, and, in fact, the body was altered. That's what my
book was all about: persuading the reader that there is evidence
that the body was altered, and that this is the reason why the
evidence looks the way it does. I might just add that if you
start with this evidence in 1992, the same evidence that they had
in 1963, unless this autopsy is overturned, you're going to come
to the same conclusion: that <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> shot the President. This
autopsy is the legal foundation for that whole house of cards.
It cannot collapse unless the autopsy is overturned in a
definitive fashion.

What would have been the sequence of events to have allowed the
brain to have been removed, since there is no evidence that it
was removed in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> during the procedures that were performed
on the body at that time?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>DAVID</ent> <ent type='ORG'>LIFTON</ent></ent>:
If I understand you correctly, you're asking me when was the body
stolen. Is that what you're saying?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Yes. When was it stolen, and why would they have removed the
brain, and where did the brain next appear?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>DAVID</ent> <ent type='ORG'>LIFTON</ent></ent>:
The only time that the body could have been taken out of the casket
(and this is covered in the conclusion of my book), and the only
time (I don't want to say that the casket is unguarded because
there are always <ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent> agents around, and you cannot have
this go forward without the connivance of some <ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent> agents),
but the only time that the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>s aren't all over that casket is
when they come back to <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> One after the shooting. That is,
after the President is pronounced dead at <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent> Hospital,
a coffin is obtained -- a large viewing casket which everybody sees
on national TV. They go out to Love Field with the President's body
in the casket. They go aboard the aircraft and they learn that
there is going to be a delay. "Why," they ask. "Why can't they
take-off immediately for <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>?" "Well," they're told,
"<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lyndon</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent></ent> is aboard this aircraft. He didn't go back to
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> on the other plane. He's on this plane."
And he appears and says: "I spoke to <ent type='PERSON'>Bobby</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>, and <ent type='PERSON'>Bobby</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> said, 'Delay the flight. I must be sworn in first in the
state of <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>.'" This is all denied that night by <ent type='PERSON'>Bobby</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>
who tells his sister-in-law Jacqueline <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> that he said no such
thing to <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lyndon</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent></ent>; that he (<ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent>) called <ent type='PERSON'>Bobby</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>,
who was Attorney-General in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, and said: I'm being told
that I should be sworn in. Do you have any objections; that it
wasn't the other way around.</p>

<p>Anyway, the result of this is that the flight is delayed by about
a half-hour, and basically, the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>s (Mrs. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> and the
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> aides) are told or requested to come to the front of the
plane to witness the swearing in. It is in connection with this
activity of "delay the flight and let's go to the front of the
plane for the swearing in" .... that's the only time that the
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> party is not all over that casket. That's the time, I
believe, (and it's a process of elimination, I will concede. I
don't have a direct witness; otherwise I'd have solved the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>
assassination) .... but it's during that period that the body
must have been taken out of the casket and put into some other
casket and brought somewhere. I personally believe, at the time I
wrote BEST EVIDENCE, that the body was flown to <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C.,
and that the alterations occurred on <ent type='LOC'>the East Coast</ent> after the
plane landed at Andrews <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> Base at six o'clock. And I
cited, as evidence, helicopter activity on the starboard side;
that is, the side facing away from public view -- and from radio
transmissions indicating that they were going to go with the body
to <ent type='ORG'>Walter Reed Army Hospital</ent> where (quote) "an autopsy was to be
conducted under guard." And all that's on the radio. And I
spelled it out in my book. </p>

<p>Now, it's an unsolved mystery as to where this body was taken.
But wherever it happened, that's where the brain would be removed
and the wounds altered. It would be done very quickly. It was
done VERY sloppily, I might add. And that's why, when the body
arrived without a brain, it was immediately noted that there had
been surgery to the head area. That's what the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> wrote down.
We're not dealing with some kind of perfect fraud here. We're
dealing with a very imperfect crime with footprints all over the
place; footprints which are ignored by <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>
because they saw the crime -- or you might say they saw these
events through very Establishment eyes. They never questioned any
of this stuff that's brought up in my book.

<ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
When did the brain next appear?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>DAVID</ent> <ent type='ORG'>LIFTON</ent></ent>:
A brain is infused, in the autopsy room, by another technician:
<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>James</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Jenkins</ent></ent>. Now let me explain this. It's kind of interesting.
There were three technicians in the room: a guy named <ent type='PERSON'>Ranicki</ent>, a
fellow named Paul O'Connor and a fellow named <ent type='PERSON'>Jenkins</ent>. Paul
O'Connor gives me the <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ount (and it's a thing that he will
never forget. It just came out of his mouth when I interviewed
him in 1979), that the cranium is empty. There's no brain, etc.
And on the chart where the body organ weights are listed (a chart
which is perfectly authentic. It has little pink spots on it.
That's Kennedy's blood. It's in the <ent type='ORG'>National Archives</ent> today)
there is no weight given for the brain, but there is a weight for
many of the other body organs.</p>

<p>That night, at some point -- and I don't know when -- a brain is
brought into the room. That brain is given to <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>James</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Jenkins</ent></ent>,
another technician. <ent type='PERSON'>James</ent> infuses that brain with formaldehyde.
And that brain becomes the evidence brain. It is weighed ten days
later, or something. It's weight is recorded in a supplementary
brain report. When I confronted O'Connor, on camera, with the fact
that there is this brain, he said: "Well I don't know where they
got it from. It certainly couldn't have been the President's!"
In other words, it did not arrive in the body. Now, that's the way
an autopsy is supposed to happen. The body is supposed to have the
body parts inside it. You know, we're not dealing with United
Parcel Service where you send something and say: "See <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ached."
The brain is supposed to come in the cranium. Now, a brain is
definitely brought into the room. I do not know how it got into
the room. I can just tell you that <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>James</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Jenkins</ent></ent> infused a brain
that night, whereas Paul O'Connor said that the cranium was empty.
And by the way, O'Connor's <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ount is corroborated by the X-ray
technician who said that the hole was so large and the thing was
so empty that he could have put his hands inside the hole.

Alright. We're going to be speaking with Paul O'Connor in just a
few moments. We have him on the show, as well, because we wanted
indidividuals who could corroborate your information.</p>

<p>But right now, we're going to ask you to remain on hold. We're in
the midst of a <ent type='ORG'>WBAI</ent> fund-raising [period] ....</p>

<p>.... My show is on the air five days a week bringing programs to
you that will give you insights. Like right now we're doing a
whole series on <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> agendas and hidden agendas, and the
conspiracies. We're targetting, right now, the [<ent type='PERSON'>John</ent>] <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>
Assassination, just because that assassination is something that
everyone would agree had a major national impact. The trouble is,
what we were told is the OFFI<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>L position doesn't blend with what
other researchers and first-hand observers are suggesting were the
actual cases. And then, we have to ask: Why would someone cover-up
this information? Why? Why would the media not report it? Why
would the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> not investigate it? Why would the <ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent> not explore it? So we're looking at that.</p>

<p>Right now, on our program (and I want to thank our guests for
being patient and for standing by) is <ent type='PERSON'>David</ent> Lifton, the author of
BEST EVIDENCE. He is suggesting that there were two caskets, one
body; and that the body arrived without a brain; and that the
brain that we were told was President Kennedy's brain may have,
indeed, been someone else's; that there was a gaping hole large
enough to put a fist through when it arrived in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>; and
that therefore, there had been alterations. </p>

<p>Now, let us see what other corroboration we could have for this.
We have, on the conference phone right now, Dr. Charles <ent type='PERSON'>Crenshaw</ent>.
Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Crenshaw</ent>, who graduated from the <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent> Memorial Hospital in
<ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, who specializes in general surgery, is presently
the chairman and director of <ent type='ORG'>the Department</ent> of Surgery at Saint
Peters-Smith Hospital, in the <ent type='GPE'>Fort Worth</ent> area. He is a professor
of clinical surgery at <ent type='ORG'>the University</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, Southwestern
Health Center's Science Center in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. Welcome to our program,
Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Crenshaw</ent>.</p>

<p>DR. <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
Thank you.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
By the way, Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Crenshaw</ent> is also the author of a very important
work on the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Assassination called, <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent>: THE CONSPIRACY OF
SILENCE, which right now, I believe, is number one on the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>
Times bestseller list. Isn't it?</p>

<p>DR. <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
Yes, it is.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
And, by the way, THREE other books on the top-ten bestseller list
are also about this assassination, so CLEARLY there is interest.
Would you be good enough to explain to us the inconsistencies
between your EYEWITNESS <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ount and the official report upheld by
<ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>?</p>

<p>DR. <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
That day, on November the 22nd, 1963, all of the surgeons at
<ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent> believed that our President, <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Fitzgerald <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was
shot at least once from the front. We saw two wounds there. Both
of them were from the front. The head wound was tangential in
nature, coming in over the right side, above his ear, and leaving
a large exit area, a vulsed[?] area in the right-rear part of the
head. There was loss of part of the parietal, temporal and most
of the occipital lobe of the right cerebral hemisphere, with
exposure of the cerebellum. It was about two-and-a-half to two-and-three-fourths inches in diameter. It was more or less
circular. And in the photos from the <ent type='ORG'>National Archives</ent> -- which
are so damaging -- this wound had completely vanished. There was
no wound seen in the exhibits that are marked "B" and "E" in the
book. This wound, that ALL of the physicians at <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent>
described, was completely gone. The second wound was in the
anterior part of the neck. It was about three to six millimeters
in size and with an arc the size of your little finger. It was
clearly demarcated as round and relatively clean-cut. Then the
tracheal tube that had been put down was ineffective. And then
Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Perry</ent> performed a tracheostomy through the entrance wound.
The incision was sharp with smooth edges, and about an inch to
and inch-and-a-half long. It was no longer than the flange on the
tracheostomy tube, which was one-and-three-fourths inches. Not
only that, after the nurses had removed this tracheostomy tube
before we placed him in the coffin, it was brought back again.
The edges were still smooth and very sharp. And in the autopsy
photographs that I first saw in looking for the head wound, this
wound was widely gaping, it was irregular, and it was now about
two-point-five to three inches long. So there was CLEARLY a
change between these wounds, that I saw at <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent>, and the
wounds that we saw on the autopsy pictures that were given from
the <ent type='ORG'>National Archives</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Why didn't you or others at the scene later complain or even make
an issue or an affidavit showing that this was an alteration?</p>

<p>DR. <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
We never saw the photos. The first time I saw these was in early
1991. The <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent> physicians were never given this opportunity.
They were only told about the additional wounds (which I doubt
whether there was another wound in the back of the head, because
I looked there) and were never told or shown any other evidence.
We were told only about the autopsy. And we, like most people,
felt that they would have had the best forensic minds in our
country to examine our President. However, obviously, [from] what
has been discussed and what we now know, [that assumption] was wrong.
And so, we had no other knowledge other than the description by the
<ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
So if you had the description by <ent type='ORG'>the Secret Service</ent>, by an
extension of this logic, <ent type='ORG'>the Secret Service</ent> or someone would have
had to participate in this cover-up, or this obstruction of
information. Would that be a reasonable assumption?</p>

<p>DR. <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
I think that's a very reasonable assumption.

<ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. Do you believe that the shots came just from <ent type='ORG'>the Book</ent>
Depository, or from the Grassy Knoll, or from where?</p>

<p>DR. CHARLES <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
I cannot say that, but he WAS shot twice from the front. And I
assume, also, that he was shot from the back. So there could not
have been just one shooter; that is, <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>. We spent all of the
next week from the 22nd to the 29th [of Nov. '63], trying to figure
out (as we had been told the official version: that it was <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>)
how in the world the President could have been shot from the
front when <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> was supposedly the lone shooter. And on
December the 5th of that year, it was the same way with the
<ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent>. They reenacted the assassination, and it was
their ability there, trying to show how he was shot from the
front, yet being shot from <ent type='ORG'>the School Book</ent> Depository. It was a
question in everyone's mind.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
We know that there was one bullet that missed the bodies of both
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> and Connally completely, because it ricocheted off of the
cement. There is absolute evidence of that. The ricochet struck
one of the people standing right on the curb. That meant that
there had to have been four bullets shot, at minimum. We know
then of three. There is an estimate of six. There were acoustical
recordings showing six shots. So even if we assume that there
were four, <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> claims that there were not four.</p>

<p>DR. <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
Yes.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Now, how in the world is it possible for one shooter, from the
Book Depository, firing at a moving target, to get off four
rounds in what would have to have been under approximately
four-point-eight seconds. And even extending it to six seconds,
it's not humanly possible. No one has ever been able to duplicate
that.</p>

<p>DR. <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
No. And I don't think they ever will be. And one other thing.
I also took care of, post-operatively, Governor Connally. And
Connally and Mrs. Connally (Nellie) have always stated that he
was not hit by the same bullet that the President was hit by. He
stated that post-operatively, and he has also stated it recently.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. The <ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent>'s refusal, against [<ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent>]
Hospital policy and <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> law, to allow an autopsy to be
performed on <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent>, and the swift removal of the President's body
from the hospital to <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> One and back to <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C. ....
Give us your insights on that, please.</p>

<p>DR. <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
Well, you know, this is the reason. I was a junior resident,
staying there preparing the President's body along while the
nurses were preparing him. But I would stay there because this is
just a law, and we MUST have a chain of evidence if we were going
to prosecute whoever had shot the President.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, there was such a hubbub with the Secret
Service. They would not have the autopsy performed there, even
though our forensic pathologist, Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Earl Rose</ent>, had told them, in
no uncertain terms, that this had to be. So they asked the
administrator to get a justice of the peace. A very young,
uneducated justice of the peace came there. And he even talked
with the district <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>orney and the chief of police, and he was
told that he should at least have an autopsy or a bullet.
However, he chose to go along with <ent type='ORG'>the Secret Service</ent> and sign
the death certificate. Also, in so doing, he checked the inquest
that was performed. That was merely his walking at the head of
the room, looking in. And also, he checked that an autopsy was
performed. And I can assure you, there was no autopsy performed
there. Then, at Mrs. Kennedy's request and [that of] the Secret
Service, the coffin was brought in, and it is the one that is
described. It was the large bronze coffin. And there, we put a
rubberized sheet there, and a clear plastic m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ress cover over
that to keep the blood from getting into the satin. He had,
initially, towels around the head, but he had bled through that,
and Mr. O'<ent type='PERSON'>Neill</ent>, of the O'<ent type='PERSON'>Neill</ent> Funeral Home, put several
rubberized sacks (we had no good plastic then), and then we
placed him in the coffin. After, again, I looked at the head
wound and placed a sheet over the President, with his clothes at
the bottom. And there was no body bag at <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent>. He had just a
sheet over there. And the coffin was the bronze one that all the
pictures were made [taken of] at Andrews <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> Base.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Isn't it rather unusual that a Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Boswell</ent> would state that he is
now removing head bandages? What is the significance of that
statement?</p>

<p>DR. <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
I do not know. <ent type='PERSON'>Boswell</ent> is also the one who has said, of course,
that the tracheostomy was almost three inches long. And it was not
that [length] when it left <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent>. But he did have those rubberized
sacks over his head. This is the only thing that I could have
thought: that maybe they thought it was a body bag. But there was
NO body bag.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay. I'm going to go now to Paul O'Connor.
Mr. O'Connor, are you on the line?</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>PAUL</ent> O'CONNOR:
Yes sir.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
And Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Michio Kaku</ent>, are you on the line?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>MICHIO KAKU</ent>:
I'm on the line.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay. We're going to come to both of you in just a second, but I
want to follow this train of thought:
<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lyndon</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent></ent>'s direct order to YOU, Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Crenshaw</ent>, to obtain a
deathbed confession from <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent> during an emergency
surgery to save his life ....</p>

<p>DR. <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
Yes, this was on that <ent type='LOC'>Sunday</ent>. Obviously, we did not watch the TV.
And the head administrator of <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent> called for a free
operating team to come to the emergency room. We went there.
We were told that <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> was coming in. At least we were
prepared. So immediately, in seven-and-a-half minutes, we got
<ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> up to the operating room, and operated on him on the cart.
We didn't even place him on an operating table.</p>

<p>After all of the <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ending staff .... some even at home had seen
this [the shooting on TV] .... they immediately came. And Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Perry</ent>
initially started the operation. I was an assistant there. So
when all of the <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ending staff arrived, I scrubbed out, was
standing there, and looked at this funny looking gentleman over
there on the left side. But, of course, <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent> was so wild
then. People were in every corner there. This man looked like the
comedian, <ent type='PERSON'>Oliver Hardy</ent>, in a small scrub suit. He did have a
badge out of his front pocket, and a very large gun out of the
back pocket. And I thought: Well gee, it's just something weird
again at <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent>. The nurse tapped me on the shoulder then and
asked me if I would take the phone call. I went to the operating
room supervisor's office, picked up the phone, and there, a voice
like thunder said: "This is the President, <ent type='PERSON'>Lyndon</ent> B. <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent>.
How is the <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>used assassin doing?" And I said: "Well, he's
critical. He's lost a lot of blood, but he is holding his own."
He said: "Would you take a message to the chief operating surgeon?"
And I said, obviously: "Yes sir." He said: "There is
a man in the room, and I want him to take a deathbed confession
as soon as possible."

DR. CHARLES <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
So I went back, I tapped Dr. Shires[?] on his shoulder and he
looked at me because everything was bedlam there. And I said:
"I've just been talking to the President of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States,
and that man over there is to take a deathbed confession." And we
both just kind of looked and knew that, had <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> survived, he
wouldn't have been able to talk for two or three days anyway.</p>

<p>Consequently, because of the ravages of hemorrhagic shock,
Oswald's heart started failing and ultimately fibrillating. We
tried all of the resuscitative measures -- chemical injections
and starting with the shocks -- but to no avail. So I then went
over and tapped this guy on the shoulder and said: "There'll be
no deathbed confession today." So <ent type='PERSON'>Oliver Hardy</ent> melted away again.
I don't know who he was. I don't know how he got there. The only
interesting part is that I know that the President of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent>
States knew that he was in the room.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Give us again the astonishing differences between the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>
medical team's <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ount of the <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent> wounds and the findings of the
official <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> autopsy team.</p>

<p>DR. <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
The most striking, of course, is the head wound which is right at
the back of the head at this occipit. It was in the right-rear
portion, in the occipital area. It was about the size of a
baseball. In the official pictures of the autopsy, this wound had
vanished. It was completely gone. And then the neck wound which
had the tracheostomy performed there, which was an inch to an
inch-and-a-half -- smooth, sharp edges, EVEN when the
tracheostomy tube was removed. This is now gaping, irregular and
was three inches in length [in the <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> autopsy].</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
The <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent> Hospital's nervousness about residents treating the
President, which resulted in <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>'s failure to
obtain crucial statements from the <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ending medical staff ....
Would you give us some background on this please?</p>

<p>DR. <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
Well, basically, there were thirty visits -- twenty-four of them by
<ent type='ORG'>the Secret Service</ent> and six by the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> -- in which they talked to
different physicians and nurses there. And it's interesting that
not ONE of these conversations was given to <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Not one of thirty?</p>

<p>DR.<ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
Not one!</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
What does that tell you? What does that imply?</p>

<p>DR. <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
It would imply that they didn't want to hear any contradictory
remarks.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. What is your feeling about <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> Kennedy's involvement
in any possible cover-up?</p>

<p>DR. <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
I've always felt that maybe he wanted to become president so that
he could reopen this investigation. Three days before HIS
assassination, in a small community college, he announced to
everyone that only the power of the Presidency could unravel the
mystery of his brother's death. And he was, of course, assassinated
then. But immediately, Mrs. <ent type='ORG'>Lincoln</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Fitzgerald Kennedy's
secretary, called Senator Ted <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> and told him of artifacts
that the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Family had in their possession. And he told her
not to worry; that everything was taken care of. So the implication
has been that the <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>orney-general or Senator <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>, at that
time, did have important information that he had sequestered
there, so that, if it were at all possible, he could
reopen this investigation.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
And lastly, Jacqueline Kennedy's immediate reactions and behavior
following the shooting?</p>

<p>DR. <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
I thought Mrs. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was very regal. She was standing there
initially. We asked her to sit outside the room. And then, of
course, after his death we did not officially pronounce him dead
because of her request for a priest and the last rites. The
priest arrived, and she walked into the room after him. We had
pulled the sheet up. It was a little short. She stopped at the
foot and kissed his great toe, and then went forward and stood
there holding his right hand, listening to the last rites.
Immediately after that, she took her wedding ring off and placed
it on the President's little finger. It would not go past the
knuckle, and so when she came in, after they had had the harangue
about the autopsy, and before we placed him in the coffin, one of
our orderlies there -- I believe it was <ent type='PERSON'>Aubrey Wright</ent> -- helped
her get the ring on his small finger.</p>

<p>I had read many <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ounts of how their marriage was just that, in
name only. But being in trauma surgery now for thirty years, I
have seen grievances and unhappiness and definite examples of
removing the facade of what one felt. And I still will always
believe that there was no greater example of genuine and intense
love for the President than that exhibited by Mrs. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
I want to thank you very much, Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Crenshaw</ent>, for sharing
your insights with us in this special report on cover-ups.</p>

<p>DR. CHARLES <ent type='PERSON'>CRENSHAW</ent>:
Thank you.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Now let's shift gears. I want to go over to two other panelists

<ent type='PERSON'>MICHIO KAKU</ent>:
I think it's very important when we look at the ballistics tests
that show, for example, frame 313 of the <ent type='PERSON'>Zapruder</ent> film which
clearly shows the President's head going to the rear, which
indicates that a bullet came from the front. Now in the <ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent> Report, the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>, of course, had <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ess to the <ent type='PERSON'>Zapruder</ent>
film and also to the ballistics -- and what they did was they
REVERSED two frames of the <ent type='PERSON'>Zapruder</ent> film to make it look like the
Now, there was one bullet -- the famous "magic bullet" -- that
zig-zagged and essentially reversed direction about seven times,
going through two bodies and winding up on a stretcher with only
two percent of its mass disturbed. However, if you take a look at
the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle and simply perform ballistics
analysis on this, shooting bullets through, for example, animal
carcasses, you can show very clearly that when it goes through
cartilage and goes through tissue, you get much more than two
percent deformation of the bullet. So, in two very egregious
examples, we have major deficiencies within the <ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent> Report.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. Approximately what percentage of that bullet should
have been missing?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>MICHIO KAKU</ent>:
Tests show that you could easily get twenty to thirty percent
deformation of that bullet. Now I should also mention that <ent type='ORG'>NOVA</ent>,
the science program on <ent type='ORG'>PBS</ent>, did a reenactment wherein they got a
watermelon, and they shot bullets through the watermelon, and the
watermelon actually recoiled in the direction of the bullet,
which violates common sense. The conclusion would be, therefore,
that it is possible to violate common sense and have the head
lurch in the wrong direction. However, the tests done on this
watermelon were of a disembodied head, in the sense that there was
no neck and there was no body. You could even blow on a
watermelon with your breath and have the watermelon move.
In other words, this is an extremely minor effect. It only takes
place when you have a watermelon suspended without being <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ached
to another body. However, tests done on animals by, for example,
deer hunters and bear hunters have not shown this recoil effect
where the head lurches in the direction of the bullet. So I think
that <ent type='ORG'>NOVA</ent> was grasping for straws, trying to get a relatively
minor effect to explain a major discrepancy within the ballistics
[data] of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> Report. And the very fact that
the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> was forced to deliberately tamper with the <ent type='PERSON'>Zapruder</ent> film
indicates that the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> itself was aware of the fact that the body
was going in the wrong direction.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
That would therefore give us the impression that the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>
participated in the cover-up of the assassination of President
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>MICHIO KAKU</ent>:
That's right. In 1975, the Freedom of Information Act revealed
some of the minutes of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> Report, which stated
that they were aware of the fact that <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> was, in fact,
Agent S179 of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>, and that he was an informant of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>
who got something like two or three hundred dollars a month for
his work, and that this information would be EXTREMELY important.
But, basically, they failed to follow it up because they couldn't
put <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> agents under oath and have them lie under oath. And so,
this report was essentially unverifiable. But three different
sources, including the Attorney-General of the State of <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>,
stated to <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> that their understanding was that
<ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> was, indeed, Agent S179 of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>. And the conclusion of
<ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> Report was that this evidence was so HOT --
it was SO damaging that it would have to be kept classified for
fifty years. Fortunately, the Freedom of Information Act revealed
this document in 1975.</p>

<p>Also, by the way, in 1978 <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Select <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent></ent> [on <ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent>]
interviewed the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> paymaster -- a Mr. Wilcott, <ent type='PERSON'>James</ent> Wilcott --
and he testified under oath that he was, in fact, the paymaster
of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> in charge of covert operations against <ent type='GPE'>the Soviet Union</ent>,
and that one of his contract employees was, in fact, <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent>.
So, in other words, <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> was a bit player and he apparently had
a role to play with the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> and also the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>. And both agencies,
of course, had a vested interest in keeping this information out of
<ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> Report.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
I think it's interesting at this point that <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> Director <ent type='PERSON'>Gates</ent> is
now suggesting that the file on <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>, which he is turning over,
will show that <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> had nothing to do with the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> assassination.
Of course, anyone who would <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ept for a moment that the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> is going
to give any information about anything that has not been altered
is extraordinarily naive.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>MICHIO KAKU</ent>:
Right. In fact, in 1973 the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> destroyed most of the <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>
file. We know that it was in two large file cabinets -- in fact,
two large file cabinets with four drawers apiece. He had a 201
file, which means that he had a very long history with the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>,
and in 1973 the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> destroyed that entire file. So, in other
words, what is going to come out now is basically a fraction of
what was, once upon a time, in the files of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>. Now the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
has been questioned about this and they said that this was
"routine cleaning" [housekeeping]. So in the "routine cleaning"
of the files, they destroyed potentially damaging information.
We will never know what was in these files. So whatever <ent type='PERSON'>Gates</ent>
might reveal, at some point, will only be a shadow of what was
actually in there.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
And CERTAINLY nothing that would implicate the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.
Also, is it not the case that the primary person pushing this
"single bullet", this "magic bullet" theory is Pennsylvania's
<ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> Senator <ent type='PERSON'>Arlen Specter</ent>, who also was the <ent type='PERSON'>Anita Hill</ent> basher?</p>

<ent type='PERSON'>JOHN DAVIS</ent>:
Now, first of all, I have to explain myself why I think there was
a conspiracy, because the available evidence indicates that
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was struck twice by bullets from the front and twice by
bullets coming from the rear, and Governor Connally was struck by
a bullet coming from the rear that was not the same bullet that
hit the President. Therefore, this adds up to anywhere from two
to four shooters. Hence, a conspiracy. But evidence that it was a
conspiracy goes far beyond an <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ounting of bullet holes.</p>

<p>Let's consider first the motive for an organized crime conspiracy.
We have to realize that, for the first time in United States
history, the executive branch of the <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> declared
war on organized crime. This had never happened before. For the
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> brothers, it was all-out war against the Mob.
"I'd like to be remembered as the guy who broke the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>", <ent type='PERSON'>Bobby</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> told an associate in 1961, shortly after he took office
as <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>orney-general. In his book, THE ENEMY WITHIN, <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> had written: "If we do not <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ack organized criminals
with weapons and techniques as effective as their own, they will
destroy us." Now, to back up this admonition, one of the first
things that <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> did, in his assault against organized
crime, was the so-called kidnap/deportation of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Carlos</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent></ent>
on April 4th, 1961. Now this was an unprecedented and arguably
illegal act. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> had <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent> snatched off the streets,
herded to an awaiting <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> jet, flown to <ent type='GPE'>Guatemala</ent>, and dumped
in a <ent type='GPE'>Guatemala</ent> City airport. <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent> had complained that he
couldn't call his wife, pack any clothes, or cash a check.
The action put the Mob on notice that <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was serious.
Upon returning to the U.S. illegally, <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent> swore vengeance
against the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>s on at least three reported occasions. We
have witnesses for three occasions in which <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent> swore
vengeance against the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>s.</p>

<p> [JD: I could not understand a few of Davis's words because
his voice was overdriving the input of the phone.]</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>JOHN DAVIS</ent>:
Immediately after this episode, <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> went after (quote)
"friends and associates" of <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Santos Trafficante</ent>, [name is
unintelligible due to aircraft radio interference], and the
mob-led <ent type='ORG'>Teamsters</ent>' [Union] boss, <ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent>my Hoffa. Soon, <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>
electronic listening devices began picking up complaints from
mobsters all over the country about what <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was doing to
them. I'll mention just two of them. They were reported by the
House Select <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> on <ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent> in 1979. [Name is
unintelligible], a mobster working for <ent type='ORG'>the Bruno Family</ent> in
<ent type='GPE'>Philadelphia</ent>, was recorded by a bug saying this: "See what
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> done? With <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>, I should take a knife and stab and
kill the f*cker. I mean it. This is true. Honest to God. I hope I
get a week's notice. I'll kill. I'll kill, right in the White
House. Somebody has got to get rid of this guy."
<ent type='PERSON'>Nicolino</ent> Carlente[sp], a Genovese Family caporegine[? - probably
means something like "royal head"], two months later was recorded
by an <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> bug saying this: "I'd like to hit <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>. I'd gladly
go to the penitentiary for the rest of my life. Believe me."</p>

<p>Well, by the fall of 1962, the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> had become desperate. In the
summer of '62, <ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent>my Hoffa, who of course was totally controlled
by the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>, confided a plan to assassinate both <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> brothers
to <ent type='GPE'>Louisiana</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Teamsters</ent> official, <ent type='PERSON'>Edwin Parton</ent>. Parton's
testimony on this issue was later confirmed by a <ent type='GPE'>Louisiana</ent> judge.
Two months later, a businessman from <ent type='GPE'>Las Vegas</ent> was present
at a farm house in <ent type='GPE'>Louisiana</ent> when he heard <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Carlos</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent></ent>
threaten to kill President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>; not only threaten, but to
outline a plan to kill him in order to neutralize his crusading
brother <ent type='PERSON'>Bobby</ent>. Two weeks after this, Marcello's <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent> friend
and associate, <ent type='PERSON'>Santos Trafficante</ent> -- who was very much involved
also in the anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cuban</ent> movement -- was talking to a <ent type='NORP'>Cuban</ent>
exile leader, Jose' <ent type='PERSON'>Alaman</ent>[sp] about how <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was
persecuting <ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent>my Hoffa. "<ent type='PERSON'>Mark</ent> my word", Trafficante told <ent type='PERSON'>Alaman</ent>,
"This man <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> is in trouble and will get what is coming to
him." At this, <ent type='PERSON'>Alaman</ent> took issue with Trafficante and
Trafficante replied, "No, Jose', you don't understand me. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>
is not going to make it to the election. He is going to be hit."
<ent type='PERSON'>Alaman</ent>, incidentally, who doubled as an <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> informant, related
this conversation to the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> and it was eventually related to
<ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> director J. Edgar <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent>. So <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent>, by this time -- by the
fall of 1962 -- must have known that some plot was in the wind.</p>

<p>Skipping a few months, we come to the spring of 1963, and an
allegation by an <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> informant in <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent> that seemed to
indicate that a plot, a <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> plot to assassinate <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was in
the wind. <ent type='PERSON'>Eugene Della</ent> Colle[sp], who was a bar man in a <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent>
controlled bar in <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent>, told the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> that in April, 1963,
<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Carlos</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent></ent>'s brother <ent type='PERSON'>Tony</ent> had come into the bar one morning
to service the slot machines, and said (quote): "There is a price
on the President's head and other members of the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Family.
Somebody will kill <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> when he comes south."</p>

<p>So, in conclusion, <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> boss <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Carlos</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent></ent> and his allies in
the Mob and in the <ent type='ORG'>Teamsters</ent> Union had powerful motives to kill
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>. We have witnesses who have testified to their planning
an assassination <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ack on the President; associates who
apparently had foreknowledge of such an <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ack, such as <ent type='PERSON'>Santos</ent>
Trafficante and the one I just mentioned -- <ent type='PERSON'>Tony</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent>.
So the motive was there.</p>

<p>Now, if you want to get into a discussion of means, we can do
that. If you want to get into a discussion of how a cover-up was
put in place, we can go into that.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Sir, we're going to get into all those things, but unfortunately,
we have a terrible, almost inaudible connection on your line.
We're going to ask you to hang up so that our engineer can call
you back. But I want <ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harris</ent> to stay on. I just want <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Davis</ent> to hang up because we're going to call you back. I'm sorry
for the poor technical quality.</p>

<p>Let's switch over to <ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harris</ent>. Welcome to our program Mr.
<ent type='PERSON'>Harris</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>JONES HARRIS</ent>:
Hi, <ent type='PERSON'>Gary</ent>. Nice to meet you at long last. I've looked forward to
this. Now, I'd just like to make a few comments.</p>

<p>I'm nowhere near as informed on the <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> level as <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Davis</ent>, who has written an excellent book, that I do recommend to
people to read, called <ent type='ORG'>MAFIA</ent> KINGFISH. My point is this. I went
to <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> at the end of '63 and then spent a lot of '64 there.
I interviewed a great many people: police, lawyers who knew
police, and so forth. It was made very clear to me that <ent type='PERSON'>Jack Ruby</ent>
was a member of <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent>, that he had been so for a long
time; that he held a very important position for anybody to hold
in any major <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> city. And that is, he was one of the chief
suborners of all <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> police who would do the bidding of Organized
Crime. He was the payoff man, which meant that he had a <ent type='ORG'>LOT</ent> of
important information and a lot of important knowledge. Anybody
who knows the case knows the ease with which he circulated throughout
those days, including getting in [into the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> courthouse] in
order to kill <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>. I don't think there's any doubt that <ent type='PERSON'>Jack Ruby</ent>
worked directly under a man named <ent type='PERSON'>Joe</ent> Civella[sp], who was the
<ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> boss in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, who directly, himself, worked under
the far more important figure, <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Carlos</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent></ent>.</p>

<p>I'd like to tell your audience, <ent type='PERSON'>Gary</ent>, that the idea of a conspiracy
does not begin with a lot of researchers and people like myself,
some of whom wrote books, some of whom didn't. It begins within
<ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> itself. I think there are not many people who
understood that one of the top members of the <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent>, Senator
<ent type='PERSON'>Richard Russell</ent> [of <ent type='GPE'>Georgia</ent>] REFUSED TO SIGN <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>
[Report] at the end when it was finished. He had felt all along
that it was a conspiracy. He had called <ent type='LOC'>Marina</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>, from whom
eighty percent of the stuff against Lee <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> came .... he had
called her a liar and said that she had lied specifically to the
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent> on six different occasions. He then had to sit down
with <ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent>, and he finally submitted to signing the
thing, though he changed the preamble a little bit. He then told me,
and told any number of interviewers and close friends for the rest
of his days, that he was UTTERLY convinced that this thing was a
conspiracy: the killing of <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>.

<ent type='PERSON'>JONES HARRIS</ent>:
When I was fortunate enough again to interview <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> McCloy some
years before he died, and sat with him and his wife in his home
in Connecticut, and we talked things over, he said to me as I was
leaving: "Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Harris</ent>, we realized afterwards that there were many
things that were never told to us." Now this was important,
coming from <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> McCloy because <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> McCloy had been priveleged
to deal in intelligence m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ers for <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States from 1917
on. I thought that that was an important admission. I believe
that <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> played a very important role in the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>
assassination, <ent type='PERSON'>Gary</ent>, but I do not think that is the total story.
And one of the reasons I think it's not the total story is the
very thing that <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Davis</ent> mentioned. I do not believe that
Trafficante would have said to a non-Mob person that "<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was
going to be hit" if <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> themselves were sending in
the killers. I do not believe that he would then have made that
comment to a non-<ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> person. I do believe that what
Organized crime did was ..... this crime could have taken place
in <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent>. It could have taken place in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. It was a moveable
feat. It could have taken place in <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>. But wherever it was
going to take place, <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent>'s contacts with those police
figures who were corrupt were going to be very important to
making the thing come out the right way. And there is no question
that in the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> area, that man was <ent type='PERSON'>Jack Ruby</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. We're going to pause and reflect on all of this, put
this into perspective, and recapitulate some of the things that
<ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Davis</ent> has suggested.
<ent type='PERSON'>John</ent>, are you back on the line?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>JOHN DAVIS</ent>:
Yes, I am.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
I'd also like to introduce <ent type='PERSON'>Gaeton Fonzi</ent>. Welcome to our program,
Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Fonzi</ent>.</p>

<p>GAETON FONZI:
Thank you.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
We're going to come to you in just a moment because you are a
highly respected investigator and journalist. You were an
investigator for <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Select <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent></ent> on <ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent>.
And we're going to get your perspective. </p>

<p>Again, it is not our intention to suggest that one group, one
individual alone [is guilty], but rather, we're looking at all of
the pieces and saying: What evidence do we have that was not and
has not been made the primary focus of either the <ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent> or the general news media presentation in taking it to
a level that, up to this point, simply has not existed. And also,
we're going to deal with some of the inconsistencies that have
occurred and some of the theories that have gone on. So we're
going to come to these issues in just a moment.</p>

<p>Now, because this is a non-commercial public <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ess station, <ent type='ORG'>WBAI</ent>,
and as a part of the overall <ent type='ORG'>Pacifica</ent> Network throughout the
United States, several times a year we have to take a couple of
weeks and just raise some funds so that the station can continue,
so that we can keep ourselves commercial-free.</p>

<div>.......</div>

<p>For twenty-seven years, as an award-winnning investigative
journalist who has broken more stories -- over two hundred and
seventy-three major stories in the areas of medicine, the
environment, consumer health issues, I have always had to start
off with the problem of not just convincing <ent type='ORG'>the American Public</ent>
that there is something wrong with something that they were
believing in and trusting in, but I also had to go up against the
very forces who have enormous economic power and who have control
over the media. For instance, just two days ago, the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>
Times, in an editorial, started to talk about the fact that there
was a challenge against the theory that the HIV virus is the
single cause of AIDS. Where was the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> Times eight years
ago when this information was readily available? And where was
Time Magazine twenty-five years ago talking about vitamins?
NOW they say that vitamins help to prevent diseases like cancer.
Yes, vitamins do. But the evidence has been there all along. And
it hasn't been hidden. The evidence has been there that the HIV
virus is not the single cause of AIDS. It could not POSSIBLY be
the single cause of AIDS. There's no science to prove that, by
itself, it causes anything. And yet, why is it that no one has
written about it? Today's Amsterdam News writes about it.</p>

<p>The problem is that you have three things to contend with.
First, is convincing someone that something they thought was true
is not. Secondly, trying to deal with the idea that if you're
going to challenge the Status Quo -- as we're challenging the
Status Quo on the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Assassination -- that means you're
challenging something that people believe in almost as much as
they believe in themselves, or their parents, or their whole
life. And that is: orthodoxy; that is: authority. So it takes a
great deal of effort for the person to even be open to an idea
that challenges the prevailing view. And then, thirdly, is to see
whether or not they believe you enough to even look at the
evidence you have, and then try it. Why do you think, for
instance, just now we changed the Basic Four Food Group, which
was a <ent type='ORG'>SCAM</ent>. It was a fraud. It was unscientific. It was an
economic ploy. And it killed people by the hundreds of thousands
and millions because they were saturating their bodies and their
arteries with cholesterol and fats. And it causes heart disease
and cancer. Well now we know that. Alright? That's known.
BUT, we knew that all along. Certain people knew it. Just like
my guests today .... they have information that they've had for a
long time. Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Harris</ent> has had information for a long time. He had
information in 1978 that nobody wanted to pay <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ention to.
"Nobody", meaning mainstream media, and mainstream belief
systems. But it didn't m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er. He has continued. We have a forum.
It's a small forum, but we have a forum for it.</p>

<div>......</div>

<p>AMY GOODMAN:
For a contribution of fifty dollars, you support <ent type='PERSON'>Gary Null</ent>
here every weekday, and you support <ent type='ORG'>WBAI</ent>, a commercial-free radio
station that would dare to put <ent type='PERSON'>Gary Null</ent> on the air as much as we
do. We don't have corporate sponsors. We don't have drug companies
who say: "We don't want our dogma, our ideology challenged."
Of course, they wouldn't say that on the air, but they would say
it to management. But we are corporate-free. We are commercial-free.
And that's what makes us important. That's what enables us to
bring you <ent type='PERSON'>Gary Null</ent>. If that is a philosophy that is important to
you, (212) 279-3400 is the number to call and support <ent type='ORG'>WBAI</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Right now, we're in the midst of a special twenty-five-part
investigation on conspiracies, cover-ups and hidden agendas.
We're looking at life in a way that we've never been told existed.</p>

<p>On the conference phone we now have <ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harris</ent>, we have Gaeton
<ent type='ORG'>Fonzi</ent>, and we also have <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Davis</ent>. I'd like to come back to you
at this time, Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Harris</ent>. If you would please continue talking
about what we now know about <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> and the
information that it chose to <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ept and review, and that which it
chose to EXCLUDE, including individuals whose testimony or
evidence it chose not to use, and that information that it chose
to use, which now in retrospect, anyone can see should not have
been included.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>JONES HARRIS</ent>:
<ent type='PERSON'>Gary</ent>, if I may, let me answer your question in a slightly broader
way than you're suggesting because the limits of your question
would better go to Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Fonzi</ent> or to <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Davis</ent>.</p>

<p>But let me say this to the public that is interested in this.
Not only did <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> go well out of its way not to
explore the <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> end of this thing. Sad to say, he's a
man whom I knew well -- and I know that he's dying at this moment
-- but I have to say that <ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent> is also a man who did
everything he could (and I worked for him down there) to shield
the <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> community. I'll give you one example of that,
if this might be of interest to you.</p>

<p>The first day I went down to work for him (and I like him very
much. A very personable fellow), he said: "<ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent>, what's the
first thing you'd like to do?" And I raised the name of <ent type='PERSON'>Carlos</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent>. And this great big six-foot-seven giant looked down at
me and he said: "Well <ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent>, of course, <ent type='PERSON'>Carlos</ent> used to be in
<ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent>, but he's just a businessman now." And there was
a pause, and then <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent> said to me: "<ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent>, you and I can have
lunch with <ent type='PERSON'>Carlos</ent> whenever you want."
Now this was one of the first things that I found worrying when I
started to work down there.

<ent type='PERSON'>JONES HARRIS</ent>:
So, my point here is this: that the decision not to look very firmly
at <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> starts almost from the beginning. It starts with
the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> Police. It starts with <ent type='ORG'>the Bureau</ent> [the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>]. It starts
with <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>. It continues to <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent>, and I must
say that even though the <ent type='PERSON'>Blakey</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> finally did come through
and say: "Yes, it looks as though there might have been involvement",
considering all the time that they spent, I found that their
information was awful awful thin.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. Let's explore that in some depth now, and let's go over
to Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Fonzi</ent>. Please hold on, Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Harris</ent>. Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Fonzi</ent>, thank you very
much for being with us. Let's explore a few things. Now you were an
investigator with <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Select <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent></ent> on <ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent>. Did
you find that there was any <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>empt by either the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> or the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> or
other leading law enforcement agencies or the <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>orney-general's
office, after [<ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent>] <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>, to downplay or to disengage the
interest of an investigation of <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> in this?</p>

<p>GAETON FONZI:
Well that was not actually one of my areas of investigation. There
was, on the part of all the agencies, I believe, not a total spirit
of cooperation. And, of course, when it came to the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, that was
even more so.</p>

<p>Let me go back to something that <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Davis</ent> said earlier on, as far
as there being no concrete evidence of <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> involvement. There was
no concrete evidence of anyone's involvement. There was no concrete
evidence of <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent>'s involvement. There was no concrete
evidence of anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cuban</ent> involvement or pro-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cuban</ent>
involvement. There was no concrete evidence of any type of
involvement. There was, I believe, no concrete evidence of Lee
Harvey Oswald's involvement in the assassination.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Are you suggesting that <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> shot himself?</p>

<p>GAETON FONZI:
What I'm suggesting is that after all these years, there has not
been an adequate investigation. There was not an adequate
investigation on the part of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>, and there
wasn't one on the part of <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Select <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent></ent> on
<ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
But why? There had to have been a reason.</p>

<p>GAETON FONZI:
Well, certainly from my own experience with <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Select
<ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>, I know the reason was strictly political. When Bob
<ent type='PERSON'>Blakey</ent>, the second chief counsel after the original chief counsel
<ent type='PERSON'>Richard Sprague</ent> was fired for wanting to conduct a murder
investigation, a unique approach to the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Assassination, the
new chief cousel Bob <ent type='PERSON'>Blakey</ent> came in and told his staff this at the
first meeting: "We have two priorities. Our first priority is to
get a report done in time. Our second priority is to get a report
done within our financial restrictions." And with those priorities
we set out to do exactly that, limiting, of course, many many areas
of investigation.</p>

<p>Let me just go on for a minute in terms of some of the specifics
that both <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Davis</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harris</ent> were talking about. I agree
that <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> probably had a part in the assassination
because of Ruby's links to <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent>. But I think, in trying
to determine any kind of strategic planning here, you've got to
<ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ount for <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> and Oswald's movements. You've got to <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ount
for Oswald's control. And when Senator <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Schweiker</ent>, who headed
the Senate Select Subcommittee on the [<ent type='PERSON'>John</ent>] <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Assassination
under the [Senator <ent type='PERSON'>Frank</ent>] <ent type='ORG'>Church Select Committee</ent> on <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent>
..... when he first got into investigating the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Assassination,
his immediate conclusion, after digging into it, was that "<ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>
had", as <ent type='PERSON'>Schweiker</ent> put it, "the fingerprints of <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> all
over his activities." So I think that, unless you crank in the
control of <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>, any theory about the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Assassination just
isn't complete.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. Can you take us into an understanding of <ent type='ORG'>Alpha</ent> 66
and <ent type='PERSON'>Antonio Visiana</ent>?</p>

<p>GAETON FONZI:
Yes, because that goes into .... when you talk about means and
motivation, I think you can find the means and motivation, not only
on the part of <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent>, but on the part of the anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent>
<ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent> or on the part of the intelligence agencies, and in almost
any direction you look. But what I feel is the strongest is the
overall picture of the intelligence agencies' connections to the
anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent>, and their motivation. And that goes back to the
period following <ent type='ORG'>the Bay</ent> of Pigs. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was given a lot of blame
for the failure of <ent type='ORG'>the Bay</ent> of Pigs [Invasion], but it wasn't his
fault. <ent type='ORG'>The Bay</ent> of Pigs was planned -- including the air strikes --
by the [Central <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent>] <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> before <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> became
president. And he was not even told about the air strikes.
Subsequently, as a result of that failure, <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was very angry,
both at <ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> and at the <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>. And he sent his
brother <ent type='PERSON'>Bobby</ent> to actually begin taking over the <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>, and set up
a secret war against <ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> that was based out of this <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent> area
here. And over the course of the years this became the largest <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
operation outside of <ent type='GPE'>Langley</ent> [<ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> Headquarters]. It was
called the Jam Wave Station and it conducted a very very effective
operation against <ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> almost on a daily and nightly basis.
These training camps, or these guerilla camps, were set up by the
<ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>. They were controlled by <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> personnel using anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent>
<ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent> as the operatives. And their spirit and motivation became
blended with the anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent>' goals. </p>

<p>Come the <ent type='NORP'>Cuban</ent> Missile Crisis when <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> realized that, as a
result of this very effective war against <ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> permitted
the <ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent> missiles to be brought into <ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> realized that
he had brought the world to the brink of a nuclear disaster. So he
made arrangements with [<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Premier] <ent type='ORG'>Kruschev</ent> to stop the secret
war and to close down these guerilla bases in return for the
withdrawal of the missiles.</p>

<p>When he did that, the guerilla bases continued operating against
-- in defiance -- of the President's orders. As a result of that,
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was forced to use other agencies -- the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent>, the Coast
Guard and other military agencies -- to close down these camps.
And in the process, he arrested some of these anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent>
whom the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> had been supporting. This was reason enough for
the anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent> and their <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> [<ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>] partners to
consider <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> a traitor. And as a m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er of fact, during the
height of delicate negotiations with <ent type='ORG'>Kruschev</ent>, it was <ent type='ORG'>Alpha</ent> 66, one
of the most militant anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> groups, that tried to sink <ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent>
ships in <ent type='GPE'>Havana Harbor</ent>, again defying Kennedy's orders.

GAETON FONZI:
When I was working for Senator <ent type='PERSON'>Schweiker</ent>, on the Senate Select
<ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> on <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent>, I developed a witness in <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> named
<ent type='PERSON'>Antonio Visiana</ent>. He was a former <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ountant in <ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent> who had founded
<ent type='ORG'>Alpha</ent> 66. As I said, it was <ent type='ORG'>Alpha</ent> 66 that was one of the anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent>
<ent type='NORP'>Cuban</ent> groups that actually tried to blow up the <ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent> ships in
<ent type='GPE'>Havana Harbor</ent>, and blow apart Kennedy's deal with <ent type='ORG'>Kruschev</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Visiana</ent>
told me that he was recruited in <ent type='GPE'>Havana</ent> in 1961 by an <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> named
<ent type='PERSON'>Maurice</ent> Bishop. Bishop was the secret behind-the-scenes strategic
director of everything that he did with <ent type='ORG'>Alpha</ent> 66.
He worked with Bishop from 1961 until 1973, and during that period
of time, he worked with him on three <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>empts to assassinate Fidel
<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent>. These were operations planned by Bishop who was obviously
an intelligence operative. He met with Bishop several times a year
and whenever it became necessary to plan strategy.

In September of 1963, he made arrangements to meet with Bishop in
the lobby of an office building in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. That was nothing new
because he had met Bishop a number of times in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. When <ent type='ORG'>Visiana</ent>
arrived, Bishop was talking to a young man. When President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>
was assassinated, <ent type='ORG'>Visiana</ent> immediately recognized <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent>
as that young man. I thought that this was tremendously important;
perhaps the single most significant piece of new evidence since the
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent> investigation, because Bishop was obviously <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.
And the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> had repeatedly denied any connection or contact with
<ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>. After we got <ent type='ORG'>Visiana</ent> to develop a sketch of Bishop, it was
Senator <ent type='PERSON'>Schweiker</ent> who identified Bishop as being <ent type='PERSON'>David</ent> Atlee <ent type='PERSON'>Phillips</ent>,
a <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> officer who had risen to one of the highest ranks in the
<ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> as the Chief of <ent type='ORG'>the Western Hemisphere Division</ent>. And we
discovered that <ent type='PERSON'>Phillips</ent> was an undercover agent in <ent type='GPE'>Havana</ent> during
the period in which <ent type='ORG'>Visiana</ent> said that he had met Bishop. In 1963,
<ent type='PERSON'>Phillips</ent> was Chief of Covert Operations in <ent type='GPE'>Mexico City</ent>, and he was
subsequently responsible for all the disinformation that the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
had fed <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> about Oswald's visits there.</p>

<p>This was one of the areas -- the link between <ent type='PERSON'>David</ent> Atlee <ent type='PERSON'>Phillips</ent>
and <ent type='PERSON'>Maurice</ent> Bishop -- that I feel <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Select <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent></ent> didn't
want to go into because it would have opened too many doors, too
many important doors. And every one of those doors was marked "<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>".</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. Now, if that is the case, then let's summarize here.
What we have is a group of individuals with intelligence community
associations: <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>. We also have a few people who were ex-<ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>,
including one who would play a very important role, and who was
also very familiar with <ent type='ORG'>Alpha</ent> 66. Then we had <ent type='PERSON'>Guy Bannister</ent>.
Now I don't believe that it was possible for <ent type='PERSON'>Guy Bannister</ent> and
<ent type='PERSON'>David</ent> Ferrie ..... who both were known to <ent type='ORG'>Alpha</ent> 66 and the people
[thereunto] associated, and who also were familiar with what had
gone on with some <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>empted assassinations of <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> (with <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
involvement). I believe that that had to have been a sub-contract to
the Mob. And when you look at what <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent>ny <ent type='PERSON'>Roselli</ent> was testifying
about in secret, and then he was killed just a short time after
that, then you start to bring in <ent type='PERSON'>Sam Giancana</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Santos Trafficante</ent>,
the Mob boss of <ent type='GPE'>Tampa</ent>. And you start showing the connection -- that
it wasn't just possibly the Mob, and it wasn't just the intelligence
community. It was a marriage of the two.</p>

<p>Still, if you look at the precision of the assassination -- and we
have new information about that assassination that we're going to
be revealing for the first time anywhere, in another week or so --
it could not have been done unless people were very very SKILLED in
hits.</p>

<p> [JD: The tape ran out here. I'll try to obtain a copy of the
missing remainder of the broadcast, but for now, let's resume
with the next day's broadcast. Here again, I missed some of
the beginning.]</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
..... ended up being there when it arrived in <ent type='PERSON'>Bethdesda</ent>. And also,
(a very important piece of evidence) the fact that there were three
separate caskets that entered that hospital .....</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>DAVID</ent> <ent type='ORG'>LIFTON</ent></ent>:
I said two.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Two. Well, also there was a circumstance of the same one being
seen twice: the bronze casket.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>DAVID</ent> <ent type='ORG'>LIFTON</ent></ent>:
Separate entries of two caskets. That's correct, <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ording to
the evidence.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
But the public was led to believe that there was only one casket:
the casket that the President's body was put in in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, arriving
at <ent type='PERSON'>Bethdesda</ent> Naval Hospital hours later, a routine autopsy being
performed. And that was the end of the story. That's what the
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent> was told. That's what we have been led to
believe.</p>

<p>In point of fact, another casket, which actually contained the body
of the President, arrived. Give us the circumstances surrounding
the arrival of that casket. What witnesses were there to acknowledge
that another casket had arrived -- that it was not the bronze
casket -- that the President's body was not the way that it was
when it left <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>DAVID</ent> <ent type='ORG'>LIFTON</ent></ent>:
Now, these are two separate issues you're addressing here. One is
the condition of the body, and the other is the issue of multiple
caskets. So which would you like me to address first?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Begin with the different caskets.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>DAVID</ent> <ent type='ORG'>LIFTON</ent></ent>:
Okay. What I was able to show in BEST EVIDENCE (and I obtained
reports which had not been examined. In fact, they're not even in
the <ent type='ORG'>National Archives</ent>, as far as <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> investigation
goes) is the report of the military casket team. In that casket
team report (and I interviewed the men who were on the casket team)
..... Let's make sure we understand what the casket team is. These
are the pall bearers, the honor guard that met <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> One when
it arrived on the night of November 22nd at Andrews <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> Base.
This is a multi-service casket team consisting of <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Coast Guard</ent>, and headed by a man named Lieutenant Samuel
Byrd who subsequently died of wounds incurred in <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>.</p>

<p>These men described to me (in telephone interviews and, in one
case, in an in-person interview in the year 1967. And it's hard
to believe that it was so long ago: twenty-five years ago) what
occurred at the front of <ent type='ORG'>Bethesda Naval Hospital</ent> when the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent>
ambulance pulled up. That ambulance pulled up and they tried to
follow that ambulance from seven o'clock when it arrived at the
front of <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> until eight o'clock when they finally brought the
coffin in. There is an hour, sort of a missing time in there. Now
we can quibble over whether it's forty-five minutes, thirty-five
minutes. But there's a serious incident in there where they <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>empt
to follow the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> ambulance, lose the ambulance, and are told by
their superiors that they have followed the decoy. There is a decoy
ambulance. <ent type='ORG'>NONE</ent> of this made it into <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> Report.
It's ALL on my telephone interview tapes. And the written report
says that they brought the big casket, which we all saw off-loaded
on TV, and the one that is supposed to contain the body .... they
brought that in at eight o'clock. That is their official written
report dated December (oh, I don't know) fifth or tenth, 1963.

<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>DAVID</ent> <ent type='ORG'>LIFTON</ent></ent>:
Now, contrary to that evidence, I actually located the witnesses
who were at the back of the hospital, and who participated in
off-loading the vehicle and the casket in which the body actually
was in. And that was a black hearse which arrived at about ten
minutes 'til seven, Eastern Time. That black hearse had two men in
O.R. smocks and a group of civilians. A shipping casket was brought
out of that hearse. Dennis <ent type='PERSON'>David</ent>, who is in Chapter 25 of my book,
described the scene of his men off-loading that casket. Furthermore,
I have documentary evidence, which is in my book (it's actually at
the <ent type='PERSON'>Gerald Ford</ent> Library now), that the arrival occurred at 6:50,
apparently. This is the shipping casket. It was brought into the
hospital. That shipping casket was opened by Paul O'Connor who was
the medical technician at <ent type='ORG'>Bethesda Naval Hospital</ent>. Inside that
shipping casket, <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ording to O'Connor, the President's body was in
a body bag. He unzipped the body bag. That statement was <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>epted
and published by <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Select <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent></ent>: the fact that he
opened the President's body bag; that the body was in a body bag.
That's the information that the body did not arrive in the same
casket that it left <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> in, even though, of course, the big
casket arrives at the front of the hospital.</p>

<p>Now, it so happens that the big casket enters twice: once at eight
o'clock, as I've just described in the casket scene. However, it
also enters at 7:14. That casket entry is documented in <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>
documents provided by <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> agents <ent type='PERSON'>Seibert</ent> and O'<ent type='PERSON'>Neill</ent>. So we have
three casket entries: the one in the shipping casket at 6:50 when,
apparently, the body arrived. Then there's this covert entry of the
big casket while the casket team is chasing around looking for it.
And that's apparently when the body was put back into the big
casket so that they could have an official casket opening at 8:00.</p>

<p>This hocus-pocus is documented. I think any historian has to <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ept
the fact that there are three documented entries. One can argue and
say that it's all a m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er of a mix-up of the paperwork. I think
that that is highly unlikely in view of the other part of my case
which involves actual alterations to the body. That's a separate
issue. But on the area of the chain-of-possession, I want to tell
you that when this material was run on <ent type='GPE'>San Francisco</ent> TV station
<ent type='ORG'>KRON</ent>-TV, in a documentary in which I was a consultant, narrated by
<ent type='PERSON'>Sylvia Chase</ent> and produced by <ent type='PERSON'>Stanhope Gould</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Stanhope</ent> said to the
<ent type='GPE'>San Francisco</ent> papers (and I was very pleased with this), he says:</p>

<p> "<ent type='PERSON'>David</ent> Lifton has courtroom evidence that the body did not make an
uninterrupted journey from <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent>. Something happened.
He interviewed these witnesses personally, on camera. He sat with
them for hours in restaurants. They are credible." </p>

<p>And unless one believes in some crazy theory of Maxwell's demons,
and that reality went haywire that night, as it is supposed to have
gone haywire in Dealey Plaza that afternoon, with all kinds of
non-physical things occurring; you know, the head going the wrong way
on the <ent type='PERSON'>Zapruder</ent> Film, or witnesses not understanding where the shots
came from ..... This is another episode at <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> that night.
And I say that what we are witnessing is, in fact, an interruption in
the chain-of-possession. A disguise was in force. The decoy ambulance
business smells. And something happened that night. Now, in my book
I try to explain what that something is. But focusing just on the
microscopic here, something happened. There are three documented
entries of two caskets. </p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay. Now let's go! What do you think happened, and how is it
significant to the conspiracy concept?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>DAVID</ent> <ent type='ORG'>LIFTON</ent></ent>:
Okay. In what I am now going to say, I'm not addressing the autopsy
X-rays and photographs. I am addressing the descriptions of the
body as recorded in the official documentation in the <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent>
autopsy report and testimony. Okay? Because the autopsy photos and
X-rays are another issue -- and an important one -- and a separate
issue. But to avoid confusion (on a radio program we do not have
visual aids), what I'm going to say to you is that the legal record
(and one of the <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>omplishments of my book was to demonstrate
that the <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> medical record, based on the descriptions of the
head wound, for example, is different from the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> medical
record), the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> record described a 35 square centimeter hole
(wound) in the back right-rear of the President's head, with a flap
of scalp connected with that hole at the back -- a wound at the
right-rear of the head. Okay? I documented that in my book.
I showed that news <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ounts, starting with the press conference
conducted within an hour of the time of death, when the two doctors
<ent type='PERSON'>Clark</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Perry</ent> conducted a press conference at <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent> Hospital,
with news interviews over the weekend, with testimony before the
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent>, with their medical reports -- it all points to
the fact that the doctors in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> saw a hole at the right-rear of
the head. Connected with that hole was a flap of scalp. They all
thought that a bullet had exited from the right-rear of the head.
When I say, "they all thought", let's say with one minor exception.
But that's what their diagnosis was. And the brain was inside the
head. It was not gone, or anything of that sort. There was severe
damage. There was some brain tissue blown out. But it was not as if
the President was in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> with an empty cranium.</p>

<p>Now, that is the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> evidence. I refer anybody listening to this
to Chapter 13 of my book ["BEST EVIDENCE"]. At the <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> end of
the line, I personally think that the finest evidence there is is a
blood-stained diagram -- today at the <ent type='ORG'>National Archives</ent>. That blood-stained diagram, executed by Commander <ent type='PERSON'>Boswell</ent>, one of it's autopsy
surgeons, shows measurements ten-by-seventeen for the hole in the
top of the President's head. Ten-by-seventeen is 170 square centimeters.
That's FIVE times larger than the thirty-five square centimeters hole
at <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent>. To use inches, at <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent> it was thought to be two
and three-quarter inches across. At <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> it's seven or eight
inches on the diagonal. In the official autopsy description, it was
listed as thirteen centimeters across, which is still a mighty big hole.
It was not what was seen in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. </p>

<p>Furthermore, specifically stated in the <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> report is that
the scalp is entirely gone over that hole. There is no flap. It is
just GONE. Now that huge crater in the top right-hand side of the
head is described in the <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> autopsy report, and it conflicts
with <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. Furthermore, two agents present -- <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> agents <ent type='PERSON'>Seibert</ent>
and O'<ent type='PERSON'>Neill</ent>, again who are also connected with the coffin business;
that is, in providing us with valuable information about that 7:14
entry -- two <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> agents report that when the body was removed from
the casket in which it had been transported, and placed on the
autopsy table, it was apparent that there had been surgery of the
head area; namely, in the top of the skull. NO such surgery was
performed in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. If the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> statement is true (and that's a
very critical question; it ought to be investigated by a special
prosecutor) ..... if the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> statement is true, then something
happened to the body between <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent>.

<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>DAVID</ent> <ent type='ORG'>LIFTON</ent></ent>:
Now that is the evidence that something happened between <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> and
<ent type='PERSON'>Bethdesda</ent>. And the consequence of that medical alteration -- if it
occurred -- is that the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> doctors thought that something exited
from the rear of the head. The <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> doctors thought that
something entered from the rear and blew out the top. Did the
doctors recognize [believe] it? Was this a perfect medical forgery?
Absolutely not. They didn't recognize it because the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> documents
that I've obtained under the Freedom of Information Act indicate
that the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> wrote down what the doctors said. So if I'm correct,
my interpretation not only goes to what happened on the body, but
what happened in the room. In other words, to paraphrase the old
question from <ent type='EVENT'>Watergate</ent>: What did the doctors know, and when did
they know it? Well, <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ording to the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>, the doctors IMME<ent type='ORG'>DIA</ent>TELY,
and I stress, immmediately recognized that there had been surgery
of the head area; namely in the top of the skull. That's what I
think the record shows in this case.

This is not some kind of a perfect crime! It's a very sloppy crime.
I think that a special prosecutor ought to question these doctors
who are still alive -- and they MUST be questioned before they pass
on. I think that we would get some stunning new information about
this case because I personally interviewed one of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> agents,
and I know that he's going to stand behind his statement, contrary
to a foolish affidavit, excerpted in some weird fashion and
published by professor <ent type='PERSON'>Blakey</ent> in a report in which they tried to
make it appear that the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> agents said that this was not true.</p>

<p>So that's what happened in the area of the head. I believe that the
configuration of the wounds was changed. Now, in the area of the
neck we have a similar problem. We have a tracheotomy, supposedly,
<ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ording to the sworn testimony of Doctor Malcolm <ent type='PERSON'>Perry</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>,
done through the neck wound. That tracheotomy, Doctor <ent type='PERSON'>Perry</ent> told me
in 1966, was two to three centimeters. And <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ording to everybody
there, it had neat edges -- neat edges as made with a knife. I
would be more than willing to testify before any investigation that
<ent type='PERSON'>Perry</ent> told me that it was two to three centimeters, in 1966, and to
offer my telephone interview tapes as evidence. In 1966, I
interviewed all the doctors on this issue of the length of the
tracheotomy incision. At the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> end of the line it was two to
three centimeters; four, some of them said. There's one or two
stragglers who say it was a little bit bigger. But <ent type='PERSON'>Perry</ent> made the
incision. He told me it was two to three centimeters. In the
autopsy report, that thing is listed as six-and-a-half centimeters
with widely gaping edges. And under oath, <ent type='ORG'>Humes</ent> said it was seven
to eight centimeters. And it has, <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ording to the autopsy report,
widely gaping irregular edges. So that is the issue: that something
happened to the throat wound between <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent>.</p>

<p>Now, if it was an entry wound, as the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> doctors originally
alleged and believed, if a bullet or fragment entered at the front
of the throat and lodged, as most of them believed, at the top of
the right lung, isn't it interesting that when the body was opened
at <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent>, where the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> doctors thought there was a bullet,
the <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> doctors found a bloody bruise with a pyramid-shaped
scar. That's circumstantial evidence, of course, but I think it's
probative. So that's the situation. I believe that there was
bullet extraction from the area of the throat too. All of this put
together raises again this question of probability. Can all these
doctors ..... can this p<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ern be an <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ident? Can we simply be
looking at mistaken medical observations, mistaken <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> reports,
mistaken observations of those who know what kind of casket was used?
I think not! I think this is the kind of stuff that the can opener
of a special prosecutor could pry wide open.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay. That's a good presentation. Now we're going to summarize
here for a moment. What you're suggesting is that there is hard
evidence, good documentation that the casket and the state of the
President's body that left <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> is not the same casket and state
of the President's body that arrived in <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>DAVID</ent> <ent type='ORG'>LIFTON</ent></ent>:
Right. There's not only a break in the chain-of-possession, but
there is alteration of the evidence.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. So they altered evidence. Now if this were put on trial,
that would be a major issue.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>DAVID</ent> <ent type='ORG'>LIFTON</ent></ent>:
That would be a major allegation. I can also guide you a little bit,
if you wish, into the way that the rebuttal would work so the
reader can understand the nature of this problem.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay. I'm going to ask you to hold onto that thought because
there's a lot more information. Now we're going to go, in just a
few moments, over to our other guest, Doctor <ent type='PERSON'>Cyril Wecht</ent>, on this
issue. There is also <ent type='ORG'>the Leibeler Memorandum</ent> which I want to talk
about. And I want to talk about some new information and the
emergence of a new hypothesis. I want to talk about the <ent type='PERSON'>Seibert</ent>
and O'<ent type='PERSON'>Neill</ent> Report. And I want to look at the X-rays and the
photographs, and the allegations of Doctor <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Ebersole, and some
of the comments from <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Select <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent></ent> in 1978.
Alright? We'll be doing that in a few moments. </p>

<p>I do want to mention to our audience that three times a year, here
on <ent type='ORG'>WBAI</ent>, non-commercial, public, free-<ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ess radio, part of the
<ent type='ORG'>Pacifica</ent> Network, that we must take a break to do some fund-raising
so that we can continue paying our bills. We're going to come back
to our guests in about ten minutes and continue on with this
information, presenting more documentation that <ent type='ORG'>the American Public</ent>
has not been made privy to, but which it must in order to make
reasonable judgments about the conclusions drawn by the <ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent>; about the role that the media has played in the
official position, and what this means.</p>

<p>Yesterday, you heard us talk about the fact that various members of
<ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> were implicated in this, and certain middle-level
members, by name, of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>; certain members of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>, by name,
such as <ent type='PERSON'>Guy Banister</ent>; the pro and anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> movements involving
<ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>, and the fact that, up to this point, we cannot find
evidence that <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> was implicated in the assassination. It's so
easy to have a single gunman, a single person, and end it there.
But we CANNOT end it there if the evidence doesn't indicate that it
should be ended there. And it does not. And so we're looking hard,
and we're looking where mainstream media either has chosen not to
look, or has looked and chosen not to <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ept the evidence.

<ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
We're allowing you to make the decision, rather than making it for
you. We'll be back with this special investigative report.
Eighteen more [one-hour] parts to this series to come. Bit by bit,
we're laying the information out. It's too much to lay out all at
once. It would be too confusing. .....</p>

<div>......</div>

<p>In our series on hidden agendas, conspiracies and cover-ups, we are
examing one type of cover-up, and that involves the assassination of
President <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> F. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>. Later on in this series we'll be dealing
with other issues, other forms of cover-up. </p>

<p>Most <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s, for a long period of time, believed the <ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent>, which said that two bullets fired by one man, who had
no connection to anyone, killed the President. There was never a
detailed effort to try to understand the inconsistencies, the
missing or altered evidence, nor the media's compliance with this
particular single view. We are now looking at new information and
trying to see whether or not <ent type='ORG'>the American Public</ent> has been given all
the information by the media to allow it to make an intelligent
decision about what really was involved.

My guest on today's program is <ent type='PERSON'>Jerry Policoff</ent> from WXIX-TV in
<ent type='GPE'>Cincinnati</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Ohio</ent>, a researcher since 1966 whose articles on the
assassination of <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> F. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> appeared in GALLERY MAGAZINE. He
has also written for ROLLING STONE, NEW TIMES, THE REALIST and
other publications, and in the op-ed pages of the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> Times
and the <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> Post. Most recently he wrote a very fine article
in the VILLAGE VOICE, co-authored with <ent type='PERSON'>Robert Hennelly</ent>.</p>

<p>My other guest is <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Marrs</ent>, author of CROSSFIRE: THE P<ent type='ORG'>LOT</ent> THAT
KILLED KENNEDY. He is also a reporter for the <ent type='GPE'>Fort Worth</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Star</ent>-Telegram.
He was a reporter for the Denton Record-Chronicle at the time of the
assassination of <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>. He teaches at <ent type='ORG'>the University</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>
at <ent type='GPE'>Arlington</ent>, on the assassination of President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>.
Welcome to our program, <ent type='PERSON'>Jerry Policoff</ent>.</p>

<p>JERRY POLICOFF:
Hi. How are you?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
and welcome to our program, <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Marrs</ent>.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
It's good to be with you.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
<ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent>, we're going to begin with you, and I'm going to be giving
information, through you, which <ent type='ORG'>the American Public</ent> simply has not
been made generally aware of, so we can throw new light on this
entire issue. I'm going to run through some issues with you. I'd
like for you to address them. First and foremost, let's try to
understand all the different things that occurred in Dealey Plaza
that most people had not even considered -- not even the <ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent>. We've been led to believe that it was just part of a
regular motorcade -- that this man just HAPPENED to have known the
[details of the] motorcade, planted himself there in very short
order, and was able to get off what is simply the fastest, most
<ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>urate shooting in the HISTORY of marksmanship -- and that that's
how it went down. Nothing outside of that occurred that should
throw any suspicion upon this. And, by and large, most of the media
in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, for all these years, has <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>epted that.</p>

<p>Quickly, let's go through it and decide what happened on November
22nd of 1963 in Dealey Plaza -- the motorcade, the crowd, the
suspicious men, the "babuska lady", the <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> <ent type='ORG'>School Book</ent>
Depository, the districting[?] seizure, the man in the doorway, the
<ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> encounter, the triple underpass, the smoke from the grassy
knoll, the third wounded man, the <ent type='PERSON'>Zapruder</ent> film, the black-dog man,
the badge man, the grassy knoll witnesses ..... Let's go through
all of this so that <ent type='ORG'>the American</ent> People can know that, all along,
this information was available, that people were coming forward,
and that this was excluded from being properly investigated or
reported on.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Right. And I think you've pretty well touched on it here. If you
look at any one single issue in this whole case, then there is
always doubt, there is always the possibility of a coincidence, or
maybe of just a mistake, or whatever. But you have to look at this
evidence in its totality. All of this evidence -- everything we
could talk about -- still comes back to one thing. And that is the
"single bullet theory". The "single bullet theory" says that one of
the bullets struck both <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> and Connally, causing seven wounds
to these two men, including sh<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ering Connally's fifth rib and
sh<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ering his wrist bone. Now if the one bullet did not hit both
men, then there has to be more than one shooter, in which case
we've got a crossfire; we've got a conspiracy. And that elevates this
thing to a whole new ball game. So I'd like to address that first.</p>

<p>They knew how long the assassination took because of the <ent type='PERSON'>Zapruder</ent>
Film. The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> diligently checked his camera and found out that it
ran at eighteen frames per second. So they know that all of the
shooting happened within 5.6 seconds. Alright. Now, within 5.6
seconds it is physically impossible for one man with a bolt-action
rifle to fire more than three rounds. Hence, they had to say that
there were only three shots fired. Alright. Two of those shots are
<ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ounted for, which leaves only ONE bullet to <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ount for the
seven wounds to <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> and Connally. So how did they go about this?</p>

<p>They simply told us -- and they are <ent type='ORG'>STILL</ent> TELLING US (people within
<ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>: [President] <ent type='PERSON'>Gerald Ford</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>David</ent> Dillon[?])
are <ent type='ORG'>STILL</ent> telling us that the bullet went through Kennedy's neck,
did not hit anything, and then went on to hit Connally. In fact,
<ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> Report itself, "Number One: Findings," said:
"President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was first struck by a bullet which entered at
the back of his neck and exited through the lower front portion of
his neck." Now the problem is that this is a small, but critical LIE!
And I say it's a lie because I'll prove it to you in just a minute.
The President was struck in the back. Okay? And they were unable
to probe the wound. However, even if they had probed it,
they claimed that it went upward and exited out his neck. Now --
there's no question about this. The autopsy face-sheet shows it.
It's marked "verified" by his personal physician. The autopsy
doctors were quoted in the <ent type='PERSON'>Seibert</ent>-O'<ent type='PERSON'>Neill</ent> Report as saying that
the wound was in the back -- the middle of the back. everybody says
that. The shirt and jacket, which are still available, plainly show
a bullet in the middle of the back. The death certificate says:
"a wound in the posterior back at the level of the third thoracic
vertebrae." And even <ent type='PERSON'>Glenn Bennett</ent>, one of <ent type='ORG'>the Secret Service</ent> agents,
in his report from hand-written notes on the day of the assassination,
said that he saw the shot hit the President about four inches down
from the right shoulder.

JIM MARRS:
Okay. No problem. He was hit in the back. But the <ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent> and everybody up to today has lied to us and said that
he was hit in the neck. Why? Because he was hit in the back, and
it came out his throat. That's an upward trajectory, and it could
not possibly turn in mid-air and come down to strike Connally.
So it destroys the "single bullet theory" which is the whole
foundation of the "lone assassin theory". </p>

<p>Now, the "smoking gun". The "smoking gun" is the minutes of the
January 27th, 1964 meeting of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>. And we have
the Chief Counsel, J. Lee Rankin addressing <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>
([ex-<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> Director] <ent type='PERSON'>Allen Dulles</ent>, [future President] <ent type='PERSON'>Gerald Ford</ent>).
And he says (quote):</p>

<p> "It seems quite apparent now, since we have a picture of where
the bullet entered in the back, that the bullet entered below the
shoulder blade, to the right of the backbone, which is below the
place where the picture shows the bullet came out the neckband of
the shirt, in front. So that how it could turn and ......"</p>

<p>And he trails off, because he realizes he has just talked his way
right out of the "single bullet theory". So they all just decided to
turn their eyes. They're not going to look at the facts, and they're
going to lie to us and say that the bullet went [entered] through
the neck. And THAT is the crux of this whole case. It was a lie
from start to finish. It was a lie perpetrated at the highest levels
of the <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>. And those people who knew better --
who knew where the bullet went, and then lied to us -- are technically
and legally, under the law, guilty of being <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>essories-after-the-fact,
which, under the law, means that they are just as guilty as whoever
pulled the trigger[s].</p>

<p>And that's what elevates this crime from the murder of President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>
to a coup d'etat in <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States.</p>

<p> [JD: a crime of "high treason" against the people of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States]</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. Let's take a look at the other evidence. Then I want to
come back to your assertion here, because if there was a coup d'etat,
I want to go through the cast of characters and people who have
been alleged, up to this point, to be suspects; such as: Organized
Crime, pro and anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and other intelligence
agencies, the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>, some of the oil cartel men, some of the right-wing
reactionaries, some of the military hierarchy. I want to look at
each one of these, because you could not have a coup d'etat without
having the participation of at least four of those groups. It would
not work. And anyone planning a military operation of this magnitude
would have known that. </p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
That's true.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
You do not plan a coup d'etat if you know that the military could
come in and stop you. The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> would stop you. The Justice Department
would stop you. So, <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent>, by itself, could not possibly
do it -- which is what's laughable about many of these assertions
that <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> could do this. First of all, it is my theory
that these members of <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> have never been very smart --
that almost everything that they have ever done we have a very
detailed history of, because they've talked about every crime
they've ever committed on audio tapes that are in the hands of the
different courts. From <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Gotti on down, every one of these
people talk. They're braggarts.</p>

<p>Secondly, they couldn't have covered-up because they've never been
able to cover anything up. In time, every one of their secrets has
come forward. And, from that time until now, if <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> was
involved, we would have heard about it on <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> wiretaps or other
taps that have occurred. So they may have had some participation.
But to assume that they were responsible BY THEMSELVES? It goes
beyond any feasibility.</p>

<p>This was a military-style operation. But the military would NOT
have committed this had they known that the security agencies
would have challenged them.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Exactly!</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
So you can't have one group [committing a coup d'etat], knowing that
there is a balance of power within our <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>. Any one of those
balances that is left uncontrolled would be the one that would
uncover it or, in effect, take back the power. So you have to have,
in effect, complicity by all the major groups. And I think it's
laughable that <ent type='PERSON'>Blakey</ent>, of <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Select <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent></ent> on
<ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent>, would have assumed that the Mob did it by itself,
as if they had the skill to do it. Their hits have been effective,
but not skillful. And these [assassins] were EXTREMELY skilled. And
their cover-up was meticulous. The Mob, by itself, could not have
covered up, and have stolen information out of the <ent type='ORG'>National Archives</ent>,
and done the things that have been done. So I want you to give us
your view of that. But let's go back and look at other
inconsistencies and obfuscations at Dealey Plaza.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Okay. First, let me make a quick point. I agree with everything
that you've said, except that I would like to point out to your
audience that I don't believe -- and I don't think you believe,
either -- that everbody within <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> and everybody within the
intelligence services knew what was going to happen and
participated actively in the assassination of President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>.
It doesn't work that way. They are all highly compartmentalized.
<ent type='ORG'>Ver</ent>y often, the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.
And the way to control that is from the absolute top. So we've got
two men who were in absolute, undeniable, total control of the
investigation into the death of President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>. And it just
happens to be the two men who <ent type='PERSON'>ben</ent>efitted most from the assassination,
and who hated <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> the most. And that was <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lyndon</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent></ent>, his
successor, and J. Edgar <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent>, Johnson's buddy and neighbor, who
was in control of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>.</p>

<p> [JD: Many years ago, I read a report that the day before President
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was assassinated, he was quoted as remarking:
"That's <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lyndon</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent></ent>, and he's in a lot of trouble."
Can anyone cite a published source of any quote like this?]

JIM MARRS:
And in the case of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>, if you can control the distribution of
the information and what information is released, then you control
the whole investigation. In other words, there were honest <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>
people who were going out, after the assassination, and doing
honest investigative work, and filing honest reports. But these
reports were thrown in with other reports of dubious authenticity;
reports which can be demonstrated to be phony -- false. And then,
from the very top, J. Edgar <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent> and his top echelon was able to
reach into this smorgasbord of evidence and pull out, selectively,
whatever case they wanted to present to the public.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
There is one other character whom you didn't mention, though I'm
sure you're aware of, and that is: <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent> had replaced <ent type='PERSON'>Allen Dulles</ent>
as the head of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, and <ent type='PERSON'>Allen Dulles</ent> ends up being one of the
key people on <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Exactly. Isn't that like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
And there was no man in the history of the intelligence community,
before or since, who's ever been as connected to everything within
the intelligence apparatus -- and very much a hands-on person --
as <ent type='PERSON'>Allen Dulles</ent>.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
That's true. And let me point out that during <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>
hearings, the allegation came up, just as it's still alive today,
that <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent> was a U.S. intelligence agent. His wife and
his mother have both publicly stated that this was so. So they asked
<ent type='PERSON'>Allen Dulles</ent> while they were meeting with <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> --
they said: If he had been an agent with the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, and you were still
the head of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, would you admit it? And he said, "No."
They said: You would lie about it? He said: Yes, I would.
And so, that's kind of where we are. I would point out that this
current committee in <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> that's debating whether or not to
open up the files on the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Assassination ..... the very first
item that they have listed that they would shield -- that they would
keep files hidden on -- is to protect the identity of a U.S. agent.
Well, that's kind of a catch-22. If <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> was indeed a U.S. agent,
then by the parameters set by the new <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>ional committee, they
can't release any information about it. Isn't that something?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay. Well, in any case, we all know that anything the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> is
going to release is going to be COMPLETELY on their side. Any
damaging files, they will have destroyed or not turned over.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
You know, let's not forget, by the way, that [President] <ent type='PERSON'>Gerald Ford</ent>,
when he was on the committee, was virtually an informant for
J. Edgar <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
I was not aware of that. Let's quickly go through the other
inconsistencies and disinformation from Dealey Plaza.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Well, of course, there's just a plethora of information there.
Beginning with the fact that the majority of people said that the
shots came, not from <ent type='ORG'>the School Book</ent> Depository, but from down near
the triple underpass, from behind the picket fence on the Grassy
Knoll. There are even eyewitnesses such as <ent type='PERSON'>Malcolm Summers</ent> and Jean
Hill and <ent type='PERSON'>Sam Holland</ent> and the railroad people who actually said they
saw the flash of light, saw the figure under the trees, and saw
smoke drift out from under the trees. And there's a point there too.
For years, apologists for the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> have claimed: Well, there
couldn't have been smoke because even if there had been somebody
there with a high-power rifle, modern rifles do not smoke.
Well, being the owner of several bolt-action rifles myself, I can
assure you that if you have one that's freshly oiled, you'll get a
nice white puff of smoke. And sure enough, in a film made by a
newsman named <ent type='PERSON'>Dave Wegman</ent>, we have a frame showing Kennedy's car,
with the stricken President, just beginning to enter the triple
underpass. And hanging in the air, coming right off the Grassy Knoll,
is an obvious white puff of smoke. So these people were all telling
the truth, and it's the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> that's lied all these years.
We've got <ent type='PERSON'>Beverly Oliver</ent> who was taking film from the south side of
Elm Street, and she had her film taken by men who identified
themselves as <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> agents. And there's a point there. In the hours
following the assassination, and for several weeks, and in fact,
all the way up into the summer of 1964 when <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>
was already writing their report saying that <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> was the lone
assassin, the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> was in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, actively, in the newspaper and on
the radio, asking people to turn in their films, their photographs,
any pictures they had taken in Dealey Plaza; and, of course,
ostensibly to investigate, to help solve the crime. The fact is
that very few of those people ever got their pictures or their
films back. And so, all these years I've had people saying:
Well look, if there's a big conspiracy, where's the evidence?
Well heck! They TOOK the evidence up. They just took it away.</p>

<p>So there was an ongoing, concerted effort to take up evidence and
to hide anything that would point to the reality of what went on.
And the witnesses, the majority of whom said that shots came from
the Grassy Knoll, were discredited, were laughed at, and were ignored.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. Let's go through a few of the particulars here:
the lack of <ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent> agents protecting the roofs, and the
speed of the motorcade. Those are two primary issues that have not
been properly addressed.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Okay. Number one: the security for the motorcade. A lot of people
don't understand, <ent type='PERSON'>Gary</ent>, that that motorcade that <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was in in
<ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, where he met his death, that was the SECOND motorcade of
that day. Earlier in the morning, <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> rode in a motorcade from
downtown <ent type='GPE'>Fort Worth</ent> out to Carswell <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> Base where he boarded
<ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> One for the short hop over to <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. Now, having been a
police reporter there in <ent type='GPE'>Fort Worth</ent> starting way back in the
mid-60s, I came into contact with a lot of police and sheriff's
people and everybody else who participated in that motorcade. And
they said that security was especially tight, and that they had
orders to keep people off of the overpasses and off of bridges that
would overlook the motorcade route -- that they had armed men
stationed on rooftops, looking for anything out of the ordinary.
Most importantly, they had orders that there were to be no open
windows facing the mototcade route. And, in fact, they had orders
to go into buildings and close windows if they saw a window go up
along the motorcade route.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>NONE</ent> of this was done in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>NONE</ent> OF IT !

JIM MARRS [author of CROSSFIRE]:
In fact, they used motorcycle officers, who were to flank Kennedy's
car, who were given orders by <ent type='ORG'>the Secret Service</ent> not to proceed
past the rear bumper. That left him hanging out there, unprotected.
<ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> police Captain <ent type='PERSON'>Fritz</ent> had requested of <ent type='ORG'>the Secret Service</ent>
that he be allowed to ride a car or two back from the President
with some of his sharpshooters and to watch the windows and watch
for problems on the rooftops. He was told: No, you can ride at
the rear of the motorcade. So, in disgust, he just went on to the
trademart.</p>

<p>None of the normal precautions were taken that day. And, in fact,
there were direct violations of <ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent> regulations, the
most blatant of which was that the men who were actually in charge
of protecting the President -- in direct violation of Secret
Service regulations -- were out drinking until four and five in
the morning over in <ent type='GPE'>Fort Worth</ent>. And they were not just drinking
beer. They were drinking <ent type='ORG'>Everclear</ent>. This was a direct violation,
punishable by dismissal from <ent type='ORG'>the Secret Service</ent>, and yet, all of
this was hushed up and covered up.</p>

<p>The next big security breach was that <ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent> regulations
stated that you would not make a turn greater than ninety degrees.
And if you had to make a ninety degree turn, you'd station
security people at the intersection. Well, the one hundred and
twenty degree turn in front of the <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> <ent type='ORG'>School Book</ent> Depository
was a direct violation. And no security people were stationed
there. Only one policeman, <ent type='PERSON'>Joe</ent> Smith, was stationed there. And
what was his experience? He said that he heard shots down near
the triple underpass by the little concrete monument, ran down
there, and could still smell gunpowder hanging in the bushes.
So you could see that there was something really wrong going on
with the motorcade.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
So <ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent> elements would have to have been involved.
Isn't it also true that the right-flanking motorcycle cop leaves
the motorcade when everyone turns onto Elm Street, and that cop
continues straight down <ent type='GPE'>Houston</ent> Street? </p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Well, that is true, but I think I have an explanation for that.
In one of <ent type='PERSON'>Mary Moorman</ent>'s five <ent type='ORG'>Polaroid</ent> snapshots, we see a
picture of this motorcycle officer, by himself, rushing down Elm
Street. I think what happened there was kind of a normal police
motorcade procedure, like in a funeral or something. One runs up
ahead, checks the intersection and holds traffic while everybody
goes through -- and then he races ahead -- leap-frogs up ahead.
I think that this motorcycle officer simply roared up <ent type='GPE'>Houston</ent>
Street a little ways to make sure that everything was secured and
that nobody was coming through there; and then he turned around,
rode back and rejoined his companions further down in the plaza.
I don't necessarily see anything suspicious in that one particular
incident. </p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
<ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent>, what you're telling us is very new and very important for
this audience. And that is that there were extraordinarily tight
and professional safety precautions earlier that same day in
<ent type='GPE'>Fort Worth</ent>, and all of that was undone. All of that was dismissed
in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. That is completely atypical, and that is something
that the media should have picked up on. That story ALONE would
have been enough, if I were the city editor, for me to send out a
reporter -- to say: Hold on a second. <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Fort Worth</ent> are
side-by-side. They're only about thirty miles apart. You have, in
one case, tight, complete, total security. And in another case
you have no security ? </p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
That's true. Well let me tell you something -- then and now.
First off ..... Well, I don't want to use any names, but a good
friend of mine, a peer, who was a news reporter at that time, and
who knew <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> quite familiarly .....and that was part of the
problem: all the news media poured into <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, but they didn't
really know <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. They didn't know how to get around. They
didn't know how to talk to the people. But this fellow did. And
he was beginning to kind of investigate on his own because he
smelled a rat. Okay? And he became convinced that his phone was
tapped, and that people were following him around. He had a wife
and a family, and he just told me, quite frankly, that it scared
him, and he backed off. Now that was back at the time [soon after
the assassination]. Today, just two years ago, a senior editor
for one of the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>-<ent type='GPE'>Fort Worth</ent> major dailies told me -- he said:
"<ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent>, I know you're right, but I can't print the truth because
it could mean my life." Okay? And the guy was dead-serious.</p>

<p>Now I, for one, do not believe for a minute that some hit-team is
going to come to <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>-<ent type='GPE'>Fort Worth</ent> and kill some newspaper editor
just because of some story he runs in the newspaper. The point is,
this fellow does. This fellow really believes it. So we've got
absolute fear still being used as a very, very powerful weapon down
here to keep people who should know otherwise ..... to keep them
silent.</p>

<p>JERRY POLICOFF:
Can I interject something here? You know, when you're talking about
security in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, of all of the places where there should have
been a greater measure of security than anywhere else, it should
have been <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> where [liberal <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent> who ran against <ent type='PERSON'>Eisenhower</ent>
in '56] <ent type='PERSON'>Adlai Stevenson</ent> had been <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>acked and spat on by a crowd.
<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lyndon</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent></ent> had been [too]. There were legitimate reasons to be
concerned about the safety of the President in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, of all places.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. We're going to take a break here to summarize everything.
Then I want to go into the means, the motives and the opportunities
to assassinate the President, and try to give as much new
information as possible, and at that time, also bring in what the
media has done or not done. I even want to get to the information
that was NOT reviewed, or not given credibility by the investigators.
In particular, when one good investigator was doing a good job,
he was fired, and a person who supported the "single gunman theory"
was brought in to take his place. So, at every level, damage control
was maintained. The only way that could have been done is for people
who were in a position to control it from the very first day knew
that no m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er how long it took -- no m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er who came into the picture,
no one in the major media, or in any <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>al agency was going
to uncover anything that would be that damaging.

<ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
My guests today are <ent type='PERSON'>Jerry Policoff</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Marrs</ent>. We're going to
come back to them in just a few moments. <ent type='PERSON'>Jerry</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent>, we're
going to take a ten-minute break because this week, and I believe
next week, <ent type='ORG'>WBAI</ent>, this non-commercial station which is part of the
<ent type='ORG'>Pacifica</ent> Radio Network, is in the midst of its fund-raising, and
we use this opportunity three times a year to raise funds so that
this station can continue.</p>

<div>.....</div>

<p>Right now, we're doing our special report on the assassination of
President <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> F. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>. It will continue until we've laid out
all of the evidence that we have; each day another new piece of it.
Now, let's go back to our main program.</p>

<p>We're talking about the <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Assassination. On our
conference phone right now -- and I appreciate their patience for
standing by -- is Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Cyril Wecht</ent>, and also talking to us on
another conference phone is <ent type='PERSON'>David</ent> Lifton. Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Wecht</ent>, you've been
listening patiently, and I thank you very much for your patience.
Would you be kind enough to share with us your concern about the
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent>'s findings and what you feel is the weak link in
that evidence, and what you would propose we should be paying some
<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ention to?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>CYRIL WECHT</ent>:
Yes. Mr. Null, I'll just be able to make a brief statement because
the time has run out for me at my end. I'm sorry. I would have
enjoyed talking to you more. My concerns about <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>
Report have been a m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er of record. They're now going back
some twenty-seven years. I believe I'm the only non-<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>-affiliated forensic pathologist to have testified three times under
oath in this m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er before <ent type='ORG'>Federal District Court</ent> Judge Charles
Hallock[sp] Jr. in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C. in 1969, as a prelude to the
<ent type='PERSON'>Clay Shaw</ent> Trial in <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent>, and before the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent> in 1975 .....</p>

<p>..... [side A of tape ended]</p>

<p>.... <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> clearance. Any staff member who was reviewing <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
documents, before he could leave, had to submit notes to the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
for review. And basically, the course of the investigation changed.
And all of a sudden the main suspect was <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent>. To put a
historical context on this, only slightly before <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> began its work, the [Sen. <ent type='PERSON'>Frank</ent>] Church
<ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> had ended its work. And, although they didn't review
whether or not there was a conspiracy, they did review the work
of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> in terms of their initial investigations of
the assassination. And the result was a blistering indictment of
their investigations; in fact, their non-investigations. The Church
<ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> made it very clear that J. Edgar <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent> had decided,
immediately after the assassination, that <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent> was
the assassin. As the main investigative arm of the <ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent>, that <ent type='ORG'>certiainly</ent> put handcuffs on <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> was guilty of obfuscation at every turn, in terms of
whether <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> was a <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agent, had ever worked for the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, his
connections or his activities in <ent type='GPE'>Mexico City</ent>; in fact, whether
that even was <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Mexio City</ent>, which is doubtful;
his connections with <ent type='PERSON'>Guy Bannister</ent> and various anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> groups
in <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent>. All of that was TOTALLY obfuscated by the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.
So, with that in its historical context, you have to really look
at the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> as clearly, at least, suspects when you're
investigating the Assassination. That was never done by [Chief
Counsel] <ent type='PERSON'>Blakey</ent>! Members of the staff [of <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Select
<ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> on <ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent>] who weren't cleared by the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> were
fired. <ent type='PERSON'>Frank</ent>ly, even at one point it was discovered that the
autopsy photos and X-rays, which were in the files of <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> ..... somebody had broken into the room in which the
autopsy photos and X-rays were kept, and had hurriedly made an
examination of them, ripping some file folders in the process.
A fingerprint examination revealed that the person who had broken
in was the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> liaison between the <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>. That
person was fired, but it didn't seem to have, in any way, raised
any questions with <ent type='PERSON'>Blakey</ent> in terms of the role of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Isn't that a federal offense: breaking and entering, and
tampering with information?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>CYRIL WECHT</ent>:
I would certainly think so.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
To my knowledge, no one from the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> has EVER actually been put on
trial for ANY crimes. Have they?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>CYRIL WECHT</ent>:
No. Never.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
So what we have is an agency that was repeatedly spying on its own
citizens, interfering in special investigations -- and yet no one
was calling the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> to <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ount. And, as a result, to this day, the
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> is still being able to do virtually anything that it wants.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>CYRIL WECHT</ent>:
Yes. And, as a m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er of fact, one of the <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> staffers told
me that, back at the time that the <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> was investigating,
one of the staffers basically put some hard questions to <ent type='PERSON'>Blakey</ent>,
in terms of his <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>eptance of anything that the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> told him.
He said, and this is a quote: "You don't think they would lie to
me, do you? I've been working with these people for twenty years."
That really puts into perspective where <ent type='PERSON'>Blakey</ent> was coming from.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. Le's go to a few other issues here. Let's take a look at
the <ent type='ORG'>NBC</ent> documentary on <ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>CYRIL WECHT</ent>:
Okay. I have to preface this by saying that I really think that
there were a lot of things wrong with the <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent> Investigation,
but it's really clear, from the outset, that the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> was
VERY concerned about what was going on in <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent> and about
what was going to come out. We know that one of the things that
the <ent type='ORG'>House Committee</ent> found, but didn't publish -- thanks to
Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Blakey</ent> -- was that the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> infiltrated eleven of its agents
into Garrison's investigation. We know that the Justice Department
was spoon-feeding information to <ent type='PERSON'>Clay Shaw</ent>'s lawyers.</p>

<p>&gt;From the beginning, the media, rather than taking an arms-length
view and holding back to see what <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent> had .... the media was,
almost from the beginning, almost prosecutorial in terms of the
way they went after <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>NBC</ent> ran a one-hour documentary
during prime-time. It was produced by <ent type='PERSON'>Walter Sheridan</ent>, who had
never been a journalist all of his life. He had been a private
investigator. He had worked for the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> family. We don't
really know what his agenda was here, but he certainly was not a
reporter. He was <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>used of bribing witnesses. The documentary,
from beginning to end, was an incredible indictment of <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent>.

<ent type='PERSON'>CYRIL WECHT</ent>:
Just to put in context what they did, <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent> went to the F.C.C.
to request equal time, and never before or since has the F.C.C.
made a judgment like the one they made in this case. They ruled
that the <ent type='ORG'>NBC</ent> documentary was so dishonest and so flawed that they
ordered <ent type='ORG'>NBC</ent> to give <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent> a half-hour of prime time to respond
to it. I think that says something in terms of where that <ent type='ORG'>NBC</ent>
documentary was coming from.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
And <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent> did respond to it?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>CYRIL WECHT</ent>:
He did respond to it in prime time. Yes.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
We must state here that <ent type='PERSON'>Walter Sheridan</ent>, since he's not here to
defend himself .... any allegations of any misdeeds or misconduct
are just that: allegations. Since he was never proved to have done
any of those things, we must keep that in this perspective.
Now let's go to the idea of the <ent type='ORG'>NBC</ent> documentary on the <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent>
assassination and the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>CYRIL WECHT</ent>:
Okay. When <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> Report was issued, <ent type='ORG'>NBC</ent> ran a
one-hour documentary in prime time, just prior to the release of
the <ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> Report, that basically was a summary of what the <ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent> was going to find. An internal <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> document, that was
generated a week prior to that documentary, reviewed in chapter
and verse what the <ent type='ORG'>NBC</ent> documentary was going to show, and also it
included in it assurances from unnamed sources at <ent type='ORG'>NBC</ent> that nothing
in the documentary would criticize the work of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> or the
findings of the initial <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> report that had preceded the findings
of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>. Clearly, the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> had an open pipeline
into <ent type='ORG'>NBC</ent> and it knew exactly what <ent type='ORG'>NBC</ent> was doing. And clearly,
there was a pipeline back that was assuring the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> that there
wouldn't be any agenda that the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> would have a problem with.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. The <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> Post and editor <ent type='PERSON'>Ben Bradlee</ent>?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>CYRIL WECHT</ent>:
Okay. <ent type='PERSON'>Ben Bradlee</ent> .... I have a letter from the then-book-review
editor of the <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> Post in which he informed me that Ben
<ent type='PERSON'>Bradlee</ent> had ordered him not to review any books about the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>
Assassination. A rather interesting incident took place after the
demise of <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>. One of the things
that <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> had investigated was a
report that <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent> had <ent type='PERSON'>ben</ent> seen in the company of a
gentleman by the name of <ent type='PERSON'>Maurice</ent> Bishop, who was said by sources
to be a high-ranking official in the Central <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>.
The members of the staff of <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>
became convinced that <ent type='PERSON'>Maurice</ent> Bishop was <ent type='PERSON'>David</ent> Atlee <ent type='PERSON'>Phillips</ent>, who
had also been a major high-ranking official of the Central
<ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>. He had been in <ent type='GPE'>Mexico City</ent>. He later resigned
from the <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> to form a support group for the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> when the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
was coming under a great deal of criticism. <ent type='PERSON'>David</ent> [shouldn't it be
<ent type='PERSON'>Anthony</ent>?] <ent type='PERSON'>Summers</ent>[sp] wrote extensively about the <ent type='PERSON'>Phillips</ent>/<ent type='PERSON'>Maurice</ent>
Bishop connection in his book, CONSPIRACY. And he managed to get
an audience with <ent type='PERSON'>Ben Bradlee</ent>. He suggested to <ent type='PERSON'>Ben Bradlee</ent> that
this was an area that was ripe for investigation.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Bradlee</ent> subsequently assigned a reporter to the story. The reporter
was in touch with <ent type='PERSON'>Summers</ent>. He was also in touch with <ent type='PERSON'>Gaeton Fonzi</ent>
who had been an investigator for the <ent type='ORG'>House Committee</ent> [on
<ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent>]. Prior to that, he had been an investigator for
the [Sen. <ent type='PERSON'>Frank</ent>] Church <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> [on <ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent>], and he was
the investigator who had originally come up with the <ent type='PERSON'>Maurice</ent> Bishop
story. The reporter told both <ent type='PERSON'>Summers</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Gaeton Fonzi</ent> that when
<ent type='PERSON'>Bradlee</ent> assigned him to the story, he told him to discredit the
story. Those were his marching orders. Far from discrediting the
story, as this reporter got into it, he developed more information
that tended to support the conclusion that <ent type='PERSON'>Phillips</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Maurice</ent>
Bishop were the same person. That is basically the gist of the
story that he submitted. The story was killed!</p>

<p>And that's really in line with what the <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> Post has done
from the beginning. The <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> Post, The <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> Times,
TIME Inc. have been obsessed with discrediting the stories of
conspiracy, and with shoring up the official <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> findings.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Then you would have to ask: Why? Is it a m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er of coincidence?
Is it a m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er of editorial opinion that may be completely
innocent of any complicity or malfeasance, or is there some
connection from the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> Times, <ent type='ORG'>NBC</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>CBS</ent>, The <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> Post,
<ent type='ORG'>TIME Magazine</ent> that would have connections to any of the major
people who are under criticism now for having participated; such
as some of the major <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> officers, some of the high-ranking people
from within the military/industrial complex, right-wing extemists,
etc. Are there any connections?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>CYRIL WECHT</ent>:
That's where I get into difficulty. I mean, I don't really like to
speculate about why I think it's dangerous. I think you can only
point to what was done. Questions have to be raised. I mean, you'd
have to ask why the media has done what it has done; why these
things seem to come from the upper levels of the newspapers,
networks, magazines involved.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Because remember, it's the same <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> Post that allowed [Bob]
<ent type='PERSON'>Woodward</ent> and [Carl] <ent type='PERSON'>Bernstein</ent> to expose <ent type='EVENT'>Watergate</ent>, which brought
down <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> in the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> and a lot of Ivy League people.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
<ent type='PERSON'>Gary</ent>, could I jump in and make a comment?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Yes. <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Marrs</ent>, jump in, please.

JIM MARRS:
You're right. And it seems pretty incomprehensible that the same
media outlets that would basically cause the destruction of <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent>
would try to cover up about <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>, but I think there is some
rationale there. First off, to explain why they do this, you go
back to the time of the assassination -- and I think <ent type='PERSON'>Jerry Policoff</ent>
would agree with me on this. This was a whole entirely different
time and place: this country. Okay? A lot of people within the
media actively, voluntarily participated and did things for the
intelligence community out of the noblest of purposes. They felt
like they were being patriotic. If they went to <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, say, and
did a story and they came back, and the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> domestic contact
services officer would come to them and say: "Well, what did you
see?" They would tell them what they saw. They weren't spies. They
weren't working for the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>. They weren't on the payroll.
They were simply doing what they thought was patriotic.</p>

<p>Now, at the time of the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Assassination and for maybe ten
years past then, until about the time of the <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent>
investigation, they were still clinging to this idea. They felt
like they were doing something good. Now, I think a lot of them
can probably look back and realize that they were being used by
these people within the intelligence community, not only to get
information, but also to give information. It just goes right up
the ladder. We've got people today who are successful columnists,
and they're successful columnists because they always seem to have
a little bit of insight into issues and into <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>al m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ers.
Well they do because they get this from their sources within the
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and within other <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> agencies. They know that if they
say anything that angers those sources, those sources will close
themselves off to them. And then, pretty soon they won't be able
to have anything to put in their columns, and pretty soon their
columns will be dropped by the newspapers around the country.
So it's a very self-serving thing. It's a self-preservation-type
thing.</p>

<p>And then you keep going until you get to what I think is probably
the major downfall and the major problem within the media today,
which is just sheer, common laziness. The <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Assassination is
a complex subject. It has many labyrinths that you can get lost
into. And it takes a lot of time and a lot of effort. And most
media people and most editors are simply not willing to devote the
time and the effort that it would take to pick their way through
this mine field and find out what's right and what's not right.</p>

<p>JERRY POLICOFF:
I would agree with that. And I would also add that I think they
were embarrassed by their early coverage. It's very difficult to
look at the work that the media did in the aftermath of the
assassination, which, by the way, was something that, in that day,
was very natural. They were spoon-fed the <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> legend. They were
spoon-fed the evidence. Everything was <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>epted uncritically and
passed on to <ent type='ORG'>the American Public</ent>. In the years since, I think the
media is very embarrassed to look back at the coverage that they
afforded this issue back in 1963, and they are basically too
embarrassed to repudiate it.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
<ent type='PERSON'>Jerry</ent>, let me ask you about a very important character in all this.
And that is L. Fletcher Prouty. And that, I believe also, <ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent>, was
the character that <ent type='PERSON'>Donald Sutherland</ent> played in the movie, <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent>:
the insider who knew all about what was going on, and who explained
it to <ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent> in the movie.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Yeah. That's correct. I believe that primarily the Mr. X character
in the movie, <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent> was based on colonel L. Fletcher Prouty.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay. I'd like each of your interpretations of what Prouty has
said and what he knows. At least you can tell our audience.</p>

<p>JERRY POLICOFF:
Well, Fletcher Prouty is certainly somebody who needs to be taken
seriously. I believe he was the liaison officer between the
<ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>. He was certainly in a position to know a
great deal about the inner workings of the intelligence community
during the 1950s and '60s. He has reported on the breakdown of
security. I'm not an expert on this, but I believe that security
was passed on to military intelligence that day in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>.
Am I right, <ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent>?</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Well, the Fourth <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> normally had agents who would
join in and, on that particular occasion, they were told to stand
down, and not to come to <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> and not to participate in the
security. And this is probably very significant because one of the
things that Colonel Prouty has said -- and the more I look at it,
the more I think he's exactly right -- that the key to a successful
coup is not necessarily finding competent hit-men. I mean, anybody
with a lot of money can go find a competent hit-man. The key is in
withdrawing or reducing the normal security. And it seems obvious
that that's what happened in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> that day.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. <ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent>, go on a little further with Prouty. What else does
he know?</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Well, as <ent type='PERSON'>Jerry</ent> pointed out, he was the Deputy Director of Special
Operations, and as such, he was a liaison between the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and the
military. In other words, if the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> was mounting some sort of
operation and they needed support -- if they needed trucks, or if
they needed an airplane, or if they needed air transport, or if
they needed weaponry or something like that, they would go to the
military and say: "This is what we need." And Prouty was the
focal point officer who would do this. </p>

<p>Now here's what was unique about his position. Since he was
military, and not <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, he was never required to sign the secrecy
oath that all people who work for the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> have to sign. And the
secrecy oath -- the bottom line of it is that: If I reveal anything
that I learn while working for the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, you can suspend my civil
liberties, convict me in a court of law, and put me away for ever
and ever. This is the basis of why so many people within the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
cannot and will not talk and tell about what they know. But Prouty
never signed that because he was a military man, and as such, he
has been free to talk. And talk he has. All the way back to the
publication of his book, THE SECRET TEAM, he has been saying
that there is a power group -- a clique, if you will -- of people
within <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> who operate this <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>
for their own purposes. I think that the Iran-Contra [operation]
has proved this to be absolutely true, right on up 'til today.

JIM MARRS:
Which makes it all the more interesting that the day AFTER the
assassination, in a memo from [<ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> Director] J. Edgar <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent>, we
are given a complete assessment of the reaction to the assassination
by the anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cuban</ent> community, and it says at the bottom that
this information was furnished orally by Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent> of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.
Well now, <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> has never responded to this, but some of his people
have said: "Well, that was a different <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent>; that there is
another <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent> and he's not the one who is now our president."
However, since then, the other <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent> has been located and
interviewed, and he says: "I was just a low-level analyst up in the
northeast and I never had any contact with the anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent>,
so it certainly was not me." </p>

<p> [JD: The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> has a strict policy of concealing the names of all
of its agents, even if it means committing perjury to do so.
So, how did Bush's people find out that there is another
<ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent> who worked for the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>? They found out because
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> officials violated their own laws by searching their own
personnel files to luckily come up with another <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent>
to pin the rap on in order to protect the real criminal who knew
of the plot to assassinate President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> and who, therefore,
is an <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>essory to murder and high treason: George Herbert
Walker <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, of course.]</p>

<p>So, that brings us back to George Herbert Walker <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>. And I might
mention that I have personally spoken with a pilot who flew arms
and ammunition for <ent type='ORG'>the Bay</ent> of Pigs invaders, and he says that one
of the oil companies that was being used as a front to move arms
and materiel for <ent type='ORG'>the Bay</ent> of Pigs invaders was <ent type='ORG'>Zapata Oil Company</ent>
out of <ent type='GPE'>Midland</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, which was George Herbert Walker <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>.
So, I think we see that George Herbert Walker Bush's connections
with the Central <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> go back far beyond what he
has publicly admitted.</p>

<p> [JD: I have corresponded with someone who told me that another
company which participated in <ent type='ORG'>the Bay</ent> of Pigs Invasion was
<ent type='ORG'>United Fruit Company</ent> which donated two of its banana boats to
support the invasion. This person said that he witnessed the
repair of the bullet-riddled deck of one of the boats.]</p>

<p>JERRY POLICOFF:
We also know that he generated dozens of memos, while he was the
head of the Central <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>, dealing with the
assassination. And yet, he made a statement after the release of
the movie, "<ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent>" that he was so satisfied with the findings of the
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent> that when he became Director of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, he was
never even curious and never looked at a single file.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
That's right. So, read his lips. He's telling us another lie.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Are either of you gentlemen familiar with <ent type='ORG'>the Council</ent> on Foreign
Relations and the Trilateral <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent>?</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Yes. I'm very familiar with them.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Are you familiar with all the different people from the networks,
the media and the major corporations [who are members]?</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Yes. They comprise a very, very substantial number of people on
the Trilateral <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent>, which is, by the way, just kind of an
off-growth or a revised edition of the old Council on Foreign
Relations, which was more-or-less a secret group, and hence, was
coming under more and more scrutiny. So, in order to get away from
that, they founded the Trilateral <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent>, for which they set
up an office, they issue reports, and they're a little more above-ground.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
That is a [<ent type='PERSON'>David</ent>] <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> group, right?</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Right. And <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent> was, and perhaps still is, a member of the
Trilateral <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
There have consistently been allegations that this group is the
group that has as its agenda this "One <ent type='ORG'>World</ent> Order". Even though
that's no longer a secret -- and I think that the President and
the media around him have used that to their advantage to talk
about this "One <ent type='ORG'>World</ent> Order" -- <ent type='ORG'>WHO</ent>SE order is it? Whose world?
By what design and what ideals are they planning it? And who are
THEY? Then you start seeing that the "they", at every level, are
the people who, coincidentally, happen to belong to this Trilateral
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>this Council</ent> on Foreign Relations.</p>

<p>In any case, I'm going to thank you very much, <ent type='PERSON'>Jerry Policoff</ent> for
an outstanding series of investigative reports. I think that, in
some ways, the history of your own writing (because I read every
one of your articles in <ent type='ORG'>GALLERY Magazine</ent>) ..... You should have
had that published in a major magazine. But I'm sure that they
would have rejected it, just as, for over two years, my first
articles on the politics of cancer were rejected. And too, my
subsequent "Medical Genocide" series, which to this day, I've
never had to retract a single line. And there wasn't any person in
that series who ever even threatened a lawsuit or a challenge that
my information was in<ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>urate. And I REALLY rip up some major
individuals and corporations for corruption and crimes of which I
call "medical genocide". In forty-three articles over sixteen
years, the only publications that would <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ept them, ironically,
were <ent type='ORG'>OMNI</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>PENTHOUSE</ent>, not the best vehicle for mainstream
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, but the only one that was available. So, I think that
tells us that when you have something that seems to be too hot or
too politically explosive, we don't have a forum for it to be
taken seriously. And, of course, the easiest way for someone to
dismiss something is to say:
Did it appear on the major networks?
No.
Did it appear in <ent type='ORG'>TIME Magazine</ent> or in the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> Times?
No.
Then how can we take it seriously?</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Exactly! That is part of the control of the media.

JIM MARRS:
By the way, I want to extend my compliments to <ent type='PERSON'>Jerry Policoff</ent>.
<ent type='PERSON'>Jerry</ent>, I have read your articles for years and years and years,
and I have used them very extensively in my research. My
compliments to you, sir.</p>

<p>JERRY POLICOFF:
Thank you. </p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Gentlemen, you're going to find out something brand new about the
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Assassination. Next week, and on that show -- because you've
both made substantial contributions of new information recently --
I will have you conferenced in to listen to the new information.
And it's going to shake people up when they hear this information,
never before discussed or written about. No one has found out
about it. That is coming up. And I think it will put a cap on this
whole thing. Whether anything is ever done about it -- who knows.</p>

<p>It's an amazing thing. You write a story. You research. You think
it's really revolutionary. It will give new insights which should
conduct new investigations. And then it comes, and the media
doesn't do a thing. And it all goes by the bye. But we're going to
do it in any case.</p>

<p>By the way, I was just handed a note by our producer who has been
working non-stop. I mean, he's putting in like 100-hour weeks on
this [investigation]. He is Kevin McCrary, and he says that
L. Fletcher Prouty is going to appear on our program later this
week. So, he'll be able to tell us, in his own words, what he
knows and what new information he knows, and new information which
he has not revealed before. </p>

<p>And I'm going to ask you, <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Marrs</ent> if you'll make yourself
available tomorrow, because we did not get to part two, which was
the means, the motives and the opportunities .....</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Okay. Can I make one quick comment about the <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent> thing.
At the time that the <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent> investigation and trial of <ent type='PERSON'>Clay Shaw</ent> was
going on, I was watching it very, very closely as a newsman. I was
trying to be objective and I was trying to really look at it and see
what was happening. And, of course, he said: "I've got a conspiracy
by the tail. I've got individuals here. I'm filing charges on them.
I'm taking them before a grand jury." In other words, he was taking
them through the normal processes of law. Well, the national media
elements within there, and even the Attorney General of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent>
States, were saying: "This guy is a nut. He's a fantacist. There's
nothing there. He hasn't got a case." And, quite frankly, I didn't
know who to believe. Today, you've got twenty years of hindsight,
and you look back and you can see that MOST of what <ent type='PERSON'>Jim</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent>
..... and I'm like <ent type='PERSON'>Jerry Policoff</ent>. I do not want to just blanketly
defend <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent>, because there were a lot of problems with his
prosecution in <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent>, not all of which was his own doing.
But, you look back after twenty years of hindsight and we find
that most of what he was telling us: <ent type='PERSON'>Guy Bannister</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>David</ent> Ferrie,
the connection to <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>, the anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent> and the plotting
that was going on in <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent> in the summer of 1963 -- all of
that has held up. It's historical fact. Even <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Select
<ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> on <ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent> was forced to conclude that most of
that was substantiated. So now we KNOW who was telling the truth
and who was lying.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Well, in point of fact, the judge and the jury said that when Clay
Shaw won his case and <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent> was, in effect, put into the closet
forever after that, and told to shut up, and the media did a
hatchet-job on him, he didn't know that eleven members of his own
staff were <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> plants.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
That's right. </p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
He didn't know that <ent type='PERSON'>Clay Shaw</ent>'s counsel had every note, everything
that they [<ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent>] needed. And also, <ent type='PERSON'>Clay Shaw</ent> lied. The man
perjured himself. And he did so with the help of his <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> contacts,
because later it did come out that <ent type='PERSON'>Clay Shaw</ent> did, in FACT, work
for the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>. That is a m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er of historical FACT. And the jury
said that they would have convicted him had they known that. So...</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
That's right. Also, he lied when he said that the did not know
<ent type='PERSON'>David</ent> Ferrie and had had no contact with him, because there is now,
circulating among the research community, photographs of <ent type='PERSON'>Clay Shaw</ent>
and <ent type='PERSON'>David</ent> Ferrie together at a party in <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Yes. So, clearly, <ent type='PERSON'>Garrison</ent> was right. The media was wrong. The
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> participated in the massive cover-up at that level, and
one very courageous prosecuting <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>orney was, unfortunately,
disgraced at the time. And <ent type='ORG'>the American Public</ent> should know that.
The man whom he brought to trial was a LIAR and was complicitous
in much of the plot, and the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> knew it AT the time.
And so, we have to be aware of this.</p>

<p>I want to thank you very much, <ent type='PERSON'>Jerry Policoff</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Marrs</ent>, for
being with us. This has been a continuation of our series,

JIM MARRS:
.... intelligence organizations certainly did participate, and, as
a result, the organization was forced to protect itself by helping
to cover-up the crime. But, of course, it goes a little deeper
than that because most of the people within those organizations
felt that what happened, tragic though it was, was probably
necessary for the good of the country because <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was going
in the face of much of their own beliefs and their own philosophies.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Now, in the case of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>, there is no evidence to point to
the [possible] fact that the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> orchestrated or initiated the
assassination. But there is all kinds of evidence to point to the
fact that the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> knew what was happening. Particularly, I refer
to the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> memo or alert -- the teletype alert that went out on
the night before the assassination, warning that a radical group
was going to assassinate <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. Those messages were
subsequently picked up, and if it hadn't been for one clerk who
had made a copy of them, we wouldn't have even a copy today, and
they could effectively deny that it ever happened. But it did go
out. So, the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>, and particularly [<ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> director J. Edgar] <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent>,
I believe, was in knowledge of what was going to happen. And they
simply sat back, allowed nature to take its course, and then
definitely participated in activities after-the-fact which tended,
not just to protect their own reputation, but to actually
incriminate <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> as the lone assassin, and create this whole story
that we have today that is the official <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> explanation.
And the way they did that was in several ways.</p>

<p>First off, there was an ongoing, demonstrable series of events
which include destruction of evidence, suppression of evidence,
alteration of evidence, fabrication of evidence and intimidation
of witnesses. Throughout your series you've heard more and more
about how documents were cooked, that people were intimidated into
silence, and that people's testimony was changed.

I'll cite you one good example: <ent type='PERSON'>Edna</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Wayne Hartman</ent>. This is a
<ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> couple. They still live in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> today. They heard shots.
They were nearby Dealey Plaza. When they heard the shots, they ran
into Dealey Plaza. They saw a policeman and some plainclothesmen
gathered on the south side of Elm Street. They ran down there and
said: "What's going on?" They said: "Here is where some bullets
hit in the grass." They looked, and they said that there was a
long bullet furrow in the grass where a bullet had turned up the
sod. In the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> report, made that day, it states all of this, and
it goes on to say that they told the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> that the bullet furrow
lined up with the <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> <ent type='ORG'>School Book</ent> Depository. Okay? <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>, in
the Depository, missed a shot. <ent type='PERSON'>Furrow</ent> in the ground. That all
makes sense. The problem is that that is NOT what they [the <ent type='NORP'>Hartmans</ent>]
told them. When I was preparing my book, CROSSFIRE, instead of
just taking the Government's documents at face value, which seems
to be the way to do it today (at least that's what the major news
organizations are doing), I called the <ent type='NORP'>Hartmans</ent>. And they were
absolutely SHOCKED and amazed when I read them this <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> report
which, keep in mind, was part of the fundamental, raw investigative
material that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> used to reach their conclusions.
Because THEY [the <ent type='NORP'>Hartmans</ent>] said: "That's not what we told them at
all. We told them that the bullet furrow lined up with the <ent type='ORG'>GRASSY</ent>
KNOLL on the north side of Elm Street." So here we have a clear
example of <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> documents that were being cooked, back in 1963 and
'64, to slant away from the truth of the assassination.</p>

<p>And lastly, <ent type='PERSON'>Gary</ent>, I'll just make this one point. When you interfere
with a lawful investigation of felony crimes, such as murder, that
makes you an <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>essory-after-the-fact. And under the law, an
<ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>essory-after-the-fact is just as guilty of the crime as the
person[s] who pulled the trigger[s]. So, in this case, the
evidence is very clear. And I can say, with great impunity, that
the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> was GUILTY of being an <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>essory-after-the-fact and,
therefore, is guilty of the crime of participating in the murder
of President <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Fitzgerald <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay, let's go on to include in this ..... [tape interruption]
..... [<ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> director J. Edgar <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent>] used the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> to break the
law, in the case of <ent type='PERSON'>Martin Luther King</ent>, with illegal wiretaps to
learn about his sex life so they could use it against him. This
was a man who was in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. Let's be very clear on this. The
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Public is not aware of this. He was in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> on the day
of the assassination. Let's also ask the following ... and give me
very clear information on this, if you can:</p>

<p> "<ent type='ORG'>Division Five</ent> of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>: Nomenclature of the Assassination Cable"</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Well that's "the Torbit Document." Right?</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Yes. "<ent type='ORG'>Division Five</ent> of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>."</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
It talks about <ent type='ORG'>Division Five</ent>. There was a <ent type='ORG'>Division Five</ent>. It was
counter-intelligence. But I think what you're getting at is the
allegations. And I'll have to stress, <ent type='PERSON'>Gary</ent>, that at this point --
I have dug into this at considerable length -- and while I have
found tantalizing evidence that perhaps this is so, I cannot
categorically state, at this point, that this has been proven.
But the allegations are that within <ent type='ORG'>Division Five</ent> of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> was
the capability of assassination -- that they had hit-men on their
payroll, operating out of their <ent type='GPE'>Mexico City</ent> office, which, by the
way, has always intrigued me because the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> is supposed to be a
domestic law enforcement and intelligence organization. It is not
supposed to be operating outside of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States. And yet,
ever since before <ent type='EVENT'>World War Two</ent>, the largest <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> office in the
world is in <ent type='GPE'>Mexico City</ent>. So we definitely have some things going
on there. And the allegation is that they had these hit-men who
operated out of <ent type='GPE'>Mexico City</ent>. This has come forth in several cases,
particularly here in <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, such as the Buddy Floyd murder case,
where the allegation was that these hit-men out of the FBI's
<ent type='GPE'>Mexico City</ent> office were being brought into this country to perform
assassinations for wealthy and powerful people who were very close
to J. Edgar <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay. Those are allegations, not proven facts. We want to make
that clear for the sake of objectivity. But we do want to state
that it is a fact that <ent type='ORG'>Division Five</ent> did exist.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
That's true. And it was headed by <ent type='PERSON'>William Sullivan</ent> who -- in 1977,
when he was about to be called before <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Select <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent></ent>
on <ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent> -- walked out in his back yark and was shot in
the head by the son of a <ent type='GPE'>New Hampshire</ent> State patrolman.

JIM MARRS:
And the local sheriff said that he knew both the son of the
patrolman and <ent type='PERSON'>Sullivan</ent>, so he felt like he was too close to the
case. So he turned over the investigation of this particular
incident to the local game warden. I've seen a copy of the report,
and it's simply checked where it says:
"Victim: Animal or Human."
They checked "Human". And that was about the extent of the
investigation.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Now, keep in mind that <ent type='PERSON'>Sullivan</ent> was one of the former top heads
of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>. In fact, outside of <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent>, he was probably the second
most powerful member of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
That's true. And he has stated some things that are very
eye-opening. One of the reasons why he left the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> is because he
said that <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent> was concentrating more on inflated statistics and
figures about <ent type='ORG'>the American</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> Party than he did on
<ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
By the way, let's also remember this. It's up to the Public to
decide whether they feel that this is coincidence or not:
<ent type='PERSON'>William Sullivan</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Louis Nichols</ent>, Alan H. <ent type='GPE'>Belmont</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>James</ent> Caddigan,
J.N. English, and <ent type='PERSON'>Donald</ent> Kaylor[sp] ALL understood what was going
on, or had information concerning the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Assassination.
ALL died under mysterious circumstances in 1977.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
That's true. All within a period of a few months, and all BEFORE
they could be [were about to be] brought to testify before the
House Select <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> on <ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
And I think it stretches credulity to assume that all of these men
from one organization -- all of whom were going to testify --
would all die <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>identally in the ways that they did: one man being
shot in his backyard in a suburban home; and the man who shot him
said he thought that [<ent type='PERSON'>Sullivan</ent>] was a deer. I mean, come on.
Give us a break. Now the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> Times CERTAINLY would <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ept
that logic and rationale, and we understand how the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> Times
would <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ept that. And <ent type='PERSON'>Dan</ent> Rather may <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ept that a man in his
backyard looks like a deer. We don't!</p>

<p> [JD: I've heard of a book (it might be "<ent type='ORG'>BETRAYAL</ent>") that states
that <ent type='PERSON'>Walter Cronkite</ent> and perhaps <ent type='PERSON'>Dan</ent> Rather (I'm not sure) are
among the people whom the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> employs as journalistic "assets."
Can anyone cite and quote such published <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>usations and their
sources?]</p>

<p>And we're offended by this kind of explanation that has gone on,
and has NEVER been explored by the mass media in any major way.
It's just been ACCEPTED that way.</p>

<p>Now, let's go to the case of Richard Case <ent type='ORG'>Nagle</ent> and the registered
letter to J. Edgar <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent> about the assassination.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Yes. Richard Case <ent type='ORG'>Nagle</ent> may be the real <ent type='ORG'>Rosetta</ent> stone to
understanding the assassination or, if not to understanding the
assassination, certainly to understanding the role of <ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> in this whole thing. Basically, <ent type='ORG'>Nagle</ent> was a decorated
<ent type='EVENT'>Korean War</ent> veteran who late became an agent for the Central
<ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>, and eventually claimed to have ended up being
a double-agent working for the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>. He said that in mid-1963,
his <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> superiors contacted him and said that they had become
aware of a plot to kill President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>, and that they wanted
him to work his way in there, find out what was going on, and put
a stop to it because it could reflect very adversely on <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> and
could make it look like the <ent type='NORP'>Communists</ent> were behind the thing.
And they didn't want to run that kind of risk. </p>

<p>So, he was sent to <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent> where he made contact with a man
whom he claimed he had known from U.S. intelligence over in <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>.
And that was <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent>! They met in Jackson Square.
And, of course, here's <ent type='ORG'>Nagle</ent> posing as a <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> agent, so he can't
very well just say: "Hey, I'm really one of you," because he knows
that <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> is a guy whom he had know in <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>, but he hadn't known
him that well. And besides, who knows what had gone on in the
intervening years? So I'm sure he was probably still trying to
maintain his cover. But he basically told <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> that <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> was
in a very dangerous situation, and that he thought that <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>
thought he had penetrated a pro-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> plot to kill the President.
But, in reality, he was mixed up with anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent> who were
posing as pro-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent>, and who were involving him in this
plot to kill the President. He said that he got a very negative
reaction from <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>; kind of like: Oh, yeah? That's interesting;
and a don't-call-me-I'll-call-you type of <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>itude.</p>

<p>Now, what's interesting here is that this gets into the whole
issue of: Was the <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent> and the <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>
-- was this the real <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent>? And it gets into a bizarre
series of situations. But there is plenty of evidence to suggest
that the <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent> in the summer of '63 and in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>
later that fall was NOT the same <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> who entered the <ent type='NORP'>Marines</ent>.
And if that's the CASE -- assuming that that may be true -- this
explains the whole situation with <ent type='ORG'>Nagle</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>. </p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Nagle</ent> is very circuitously trying to warn <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>, believing that
this is the same guy he knew in <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>, and that he would recognize
him and realize that he was getting the information from U.S.
intelligence. And yet, if it was NOT the same <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> -- and there
is MUCH evidence to suggest that this is so -- then <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> in New
Orleans didn't recognize <ent type='ORG'>Nagle</ent>, didn't know who he was, and only
perhaps knew him as a <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> officer, and therefore, would be very
hesitant to believe him or to act on his information.</p>

<p>So that's the <ent type='ORG'>Nagle</ent> story, and I think it pretty well pinpoints
the role of <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>, as his mother and his wife had both
publicly stated, was a U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> agent. He was posing as a
pro-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent>ite and as a pro-<ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> to infiltrate groups that he
felt were pro-<ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> groups. In this instance, I think he had
been picked up by one of the more violent anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> groups who
played him along and helped set him up as the "patsy"
in the assassination.

<ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright, we're going to recapitulate here for a moment, and then I
want to go on with some of the other scenarios involved in all this.
I want to take a look at renegade <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> cliques. I also want to
examine right-wing extremists and <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent>. I want to take
a very careful look at <ent type='PERSON'>Sam Giancana</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent>ny <ent type='PERSON'>Roselli</ent> and some
of the other people involved.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Don't forget <ent type='ORG'>the Military</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
We're going to come to <ent type='ORG'>the Military</ent>, and also some of the people
who have never really been brought out yet; and that is, I want to
see the <ent type='PERSON'>Howard Hughes</ent> challenge -- the challenge that Howard
<ent type='ORG'>Hughes</ent> may have had a role in this. We're going to look at that.
We're also going to look at some couriers and some communications
experts and some possible hit-men. So, all of this is going to
be laid out, hopefully, during the remainder of the program --
time permitting.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
<ent type='PERSON'>Gary</ent>, before we end this program today, let's not forget to discuss
what I think is the most important thing, which is the common
connecting point, the nexus between all of these groups. And there
IS a connecting point. And it is intriguing. And I think it points
the way toward the solution of who was behind the assassination.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
We will get to that in just a minute. Just to summarize, we are
talking about J. Edgar <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent>. We have ruled out, at this point,
and I feel that history and all the evidence completely rules out
that the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>s were involved. Premier Nikita <ent type='ORG'>Kruschev</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>
Chairman <ent type='PERSON'>Yuri Andropov</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> expert-turned-defector Yuri
Nosinkov[sp], <ent type='LOC'>Marina</ent> Pruskovka[sp] <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>, Oswald's control agent
<ent type='PERSON'>Albert Osborne</ent>, and even the <ent type='NORP'>Latin</ent> leftist guerillas coordinated
by "the second <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>", code-named <ent type='PERSON'>Alec</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Heidel</ent>[sp] a trained <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>
assassin. These people simply did not directly participate.
There's no evidence. We've ruled them out.</p>

<p>We have certainly ruled in J. Edgar <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent> as knowing about it.
That's clear. ... certain other <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> agents knowing about it, and
the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> being FORCED, upon the mandate of <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent>, to participate in
the cover-up, based upon <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> stating that it was
the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> that was to provide all the information to the <ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent> through all the interviews. We have repeated references
to them altering evidence, destroying evidence, tampering with
evidence, intimidating witnesses, threatening witnesses .....
And that is not a m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er of speculation. That is a m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er of fact,
and is demonstrable by [the terms of] law. So, clearly, they
are one of the lead characters.</p>

<p>In a moment, we're going to go on with our special investigation.
I'm <ent type='PERSON'>Gary Null</ent>. Kevin McCreary is the co-producer on this. </p>

<p>....... [passages lost due to tape ending]</p>

<p>..... stories in the media are simply spurious and speculative,
and they've even gone so far as to try to denigrate anyone who
would come up with an idea other than <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> acting alone. Thus far,
however, there's absolutely NO evidence -- no hard evidence -- that
<ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> was involved in the assassination <ent type='ORG'>WHATSOEVER</ent>. So let's take
a look now ..... Why don't we go to <ent type='ORG'>the Military</ent>?</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Well, I think this may be one of the key factors because if you'll
stop and think about it in its broadest scope, you'll understand
that there was absolutely no way that there could be any kind of
large-scale assassination conspiracy that did not, in some way,
take into <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ount <ent type='ORG'>the Military</ent>, because <ent type='ORG'>the Military</ent> is the armed
force in this country. I mean, as we saw in the <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent> riots,
when the local authorities can't handle the situation, <ent type='ORG'>the Military</ent>
moves in. And they would have done this in 1963 if there had been
some large-scale coup that did not include them. You have to, at
least, neutralize <ent type='ORG'>the Military</ent>, if not have them actively on your
side -- which was done.</p>

<p>Now -- we're getting to the nub of it now, <ent type='PERSON'>Gary</ent>, because people who
have studied this assassination in great detail say: "Well, was it
the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>? Was it the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>? Was it the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>? Was it the anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent>
<ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent>? Was it <ent type='ORG'>the Military</ent>?" And this particular line of
questioning has kept us confused for a good number of years because
the truthful answer is: "YES! It was ALL of them!" Now, you say:
"Oh, my God! Now you're talking about a huge, massive conspiracy.
And nobody could have kept quiet about that." </p>

<p>No. That's not what I'm talking about. But I'm talking about
"Operation Mongoose." There was a connection, a nexus point, back
in the early '60s -- in '61, '62. And it was "Operation Mongoose:
<ent type='EVENT'>The Secret War Against</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent>." Most of this is now historical
record. The Senate <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>, under [Sen. <ent type='PERSON'>Frank</ent>] Church
[D.-<ent type='GPE'>Idaho</ent>] and those -- Sen. <ent type='PERSON'>Gary</ent> Hart [D.-<ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent>], developed this
information back in the early '70s. It was all in the newspapers.
It has all been established. The plot: "<ent type='EVENT'>The Secret War Against</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent>", was headed out of the JIMWAVE[sp] Station (which is a <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
acronym) on the campus of <ent type='ORG'>the University</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent>. It involved
anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agents, military officers, <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> people ...
And THERE we have the common ground, the commonality, the nexus
point at which they were all operating together.</p>

<p>And what were they doing? They were mixed up in plots to overthrow
<ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>, and they were mixed up in plots specifically to assassinate
[<ent type='NORP'>Cuban</ent> Premier] Fidel <ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent>. That's historical fact. Why is it
such a big leap in understanding to realize that these same people,
who were trained and who were gearing up to kill <ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent>, suddenly
were just directed to <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>? Because the common thought at that
time was that the problem really was in the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> and not in
<ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>; that we COULD <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ack <ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>, we could knock over Fidel <ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent>
IF we had a president and an administration that was willing
to do that.

JIM MARRS [author of CROSSFIRE]:
Now, here's another key point. A few years ago, I was in Alpa 66
Headquarters in <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent>. This is one of the oldest and most violent
of the anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> organizations. And I was talking to some of
those people and they were reminiscing about those days. And
something came up about <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent>ny <ent type='PERSON'>Roselli</ent>, the very TOP-ranking <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>
guy, and he was. He was a very high-ranking man in the Organized
Crime field. He was kind of the <ent type='PERSON'>Henry Kissinger</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent>
in that he would travel between the crime families and help make
deals and help make peace between the crime families. This is a TOP-ranking position. And these people in <ent type='ORG'>Alpha</ent> 66 said that they were
amazed, in recent years, to learn that <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent>ny <ent type='PERSON'>Roselli</ent> was this
<ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> chieftain, because back at the time of "Operation Mongoose,"
they only knew him as "Colonel <ent type='PERSON'>Roselli</ent>." And Colonel <ent type='PERSON'>Roselli</ent> had
full military credentials, flew in military aircraft piloted by
military personnel, and was an integral part, and a leader of this
secret war to kill <ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> and to change governments in <ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>.</p>

<p>So, here now .... and of course the fact that the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>
were working together in these assassination plots has been well
established. It too is absolute historical fact. So what we have
here is ... we have a situation just prior to the assassination of
President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>, where the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, the anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent>
and the MILITARY are all actively working together on a variety of
schemes which include assassination. And I think THAT may be the
key to this whole thing.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay. Let's take it a little deeper now. That's some of the basic
scenarios. I still want to go into some of the people in specifics.
When it comes to <ent type='ORG'>the Military</ent>, let's look at that time, at <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>
and <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>, and the military-industrial complex at that time.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Exactly. Dwight D. <ent type='PERSON'>Eisenhower</ent>, in his farewell address, warned us
against the acquisition of power, whether overtly or covertly, by
what he called the "military-industrial complex." And the military-industrial complex is MUCH broader, much more powerful than anyone
I think, even myself, could imagine because, basically, the
military-industrial complex equates to the Status Quo. And never
underestimate the power of the Status Quo. I like to think of
myself as an educated, thoughtful, broad-minded intellectual-type
person. And yet, I'll be the first to admit that there are certain
things that I become very set in my ways about. I like my hamburger
built a certain way, and that's the way I get it. We all are like
that. We all settle into our comfortable lives and comfortable
routines that we are familiar and comfortable with. Okay?
This is the status quo, and it's tough to get out of there.</p>

<p>In 1941, we went onto a full-scale war economy, and we are just now
making the first beginning steps to try to get off of that. And
it's very painful. It's causing a lot of problems. Down here in my
home state of <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> we're really being hurt by the fact that some
of these military bases are being closed, some of the big defense
industries are laying people off. It's a painful process, but it's
gone on all through history. Once you create a giant military force,
that force just doesn't want to go away. And it doesn't go away by
itself. It takes time. It takes effort. Sometimes it's very painful.
And I think that's what <ent type='PERSON'>Eisenhower</ent> was talking about. And we've
been under this military-industrial complex ever since.</p>

<p>The intelligence agencies -- the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>DIA</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent> -- some of
these twenty-two intelligence agencies, that we have operating in
this country to this very day, are simply the security arm of this
military-industrial complex. And the military-industrial complex,
needless to say, is not going to look kindly on anyone who would
try to dismantle it. And yet, if we go back and look at the record,
we find that essentially, this is exactly what <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> F. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was
trying to do.</p>

<p>After <ent type='ORG'>the Bay</ent> of Pigs [Invasion] and after the <ent type='NORP'>Cuban</ent> Missile Crisis,
he signed off on <ent type='ORG'>National Security Action Memoranda</ent> 55, 56 and 57.
And basically, the bottom line of these memoranda was to bring
control over the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> back under <ent type='ORG'>the Military</ent>. He said that the
Joint Chiefs-of-Staff would be held responsible for any military or
even quasi-military activities that took place in the <ent type='ORG'>World</ent> that
was initiated by <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States. So this was an <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>empt to bring
the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> back under the control of <ent type='ORG'>the Military</ent>.</p>

<p>In National Security Action Memorandum 263, we see that he approved
the recommendations of the [Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent>] McNamara
Report which stated that we could have all United States military
personnel out of <ent type='LOC'>Southeast Asia</ent> by the end of 1965, and, in fact,
he ordered the withdrawal of one thousand military advisors by the
end of 1963. These were his beginning steps to disengage from Viet
Nam. <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Newman, an eighteen-year veteran of military intelligence,
has written a book titled <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent> IN VIET NAM. And in there, based on
actual <ent type='ORG'>National Security Council</ent> minutes, actual orders that are on
file, he showed, beyond any question, that <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was not just
THINKING about pulling us out of <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>, but he had actually
ORDERED that event, and that we had begun to move in that direction.</p>

<p>Of course, after he was killed, his successor, <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lyndon</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent></ent>,
signed <ent type='ORG'>National Security Memorandum</ent> 273, which quietly and subtly
said that there would be no troop decrease from the time of the
Diem <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>, which was November the first. That was a subtle
way of blocking Kennedy's pull-out order. And no meaningful drop in
U.S. presence took place in <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>. </p>

<p>And then, of course, in '64, while <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> was
putting the finishing touches on their report that said <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> ws
the lone nut assassin, we had the phony Gulf of Tonkin Incident,
and <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent> managed to push through a panicked <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> the Gulf of
Tonkin Resolution -- which abrogates the Constitution of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent>
States, which says that only <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> shall have the power to
declare war -- and gave those war-making powers to <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent> himself.
And off we went into a ten-year war that was very much desired by
the U.S. Military and by their <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>endant groups, their security
agencies, the intelligence groups, and also by the defense
industries and the bankers who supported them. And it's wide! It's
pervasive! It reaches into every state in this Union.
(to be continued)
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * </p>

<p> As the elaborately concocted smokescreen fades away from the
faces of the gang of murderers who perpetrated this, THE
highest crime of treason in the history of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States,
we stand flabbergasted and enraged to realize the enormity of
the traitors' crimes. They have sc<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ered the brains of the
People's President onto the streets of an <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> city.
They have, just as cold-bloodedly, murdered (what is it?)
two hundred or so people, from <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agent <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> to <ent type='PERSON'>Sam Holland</ent>
to columnist <ent type='PERSON'>Dorothy Kilgallen</ent> to Senator <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> F. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>. </p>

<p> They have perpetrated a ten-year holocaust comprising the
slaughter of over fifty-eight thousand sons of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, the
wounding and maiming (both physically and psychologically)
of maybe a quarter of a million more of us who served in that
beautiful country transformed into one great hellish inferno;
the absolute genocide (and there's no more <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>urate word for
it than "genocide") of two million valiant peasants, who
staunchly sacrificed everything, including themselves, to free
their country from the clutches of a brutal invader. </p>

<p> There are <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>ese babies born every day now with arms growing
out of their chests. Those people are suffering the myriad horrors
of nature's processes gone wild -- all because <ent type='ORG'>Dow Chemical</ent>
Company wanted to save the few bucks needed to purge dioxin
from the tons and tons of Agent Orange defoliant with which
the genocidal profiteers drenched the <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>ese countryside.
So they soaked <ent type='ORG'>the American</ent> taxpayer for Agent Orange enriched
with dioxin -- about the most toxic chemical known to all life
-- and they soaked <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> boys and <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>ese people with tons
of death from the skies; not instant death, like the 1000-pound bombs that rained down daily, but slow, torturous,
agonized death -- death, or a lifetime of suffering for Viet
Nam's future mothers and their babies, who would live out
their short lives with deformed bodies and incurable cancers;
and these horrors will be revisited upon all succeeding
generations, to the horizons of time.</p>

<p> A brilliant <ent type='ORG'>WBAI</ent> political scholar and humanitarian named <ent type='PERSON'>Leo</ent>
Cawley was representative of the multitudes of <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> victims of
that war. <ent type='PERSON'>Leo</ent> was a combat <ent type='ORG'>Marine</ent> who suffered for twenty years
until his death from <ent type='ORG'>Dow Chemical</ent>'s lucrative defoliant/depopulant.
But even as he withered away, <ent type='PERSON'>Leo</ent> condemned Bush's Persian Gulf
War with passion and compassion. We could all give at least a
bit of our time and energy to organizing against tomorrow's
holocausts for the sake of tomorrow's victims, and in memory
of yesterday's victims.</p>

<p> The evil men of the military-industrial complex and their <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
will never be brought to trial. But that's okay. We're working
toward a higher form of justice than even the rectification of
the U.S. Government's farcical facade of a justice system could
possibly imply. We're striving, not to throw these genocidists
into jail cells, but rather, to defeat their system of evil before
they can launch more such genocidal adventures like the ones in
<ent type='GPE'>Korea</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Angola</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Lebanon</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Grenada</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>.</p>

JIM MARRS:
Probably, a healthy percentage of the population of this country
derives their direct income, in one way or another, from this
military-industrial state, either working directly for the
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>, or through military pensions, or through active military
[duty], or through the defense contractors or, even from small
companies that produce shoelaces for combat boots, pins for hand
grenades, etcetera. I'm not sure we're even yet in a position to
really, truthfully evaluate the impact of the military-industrial
complex on this country.</p>

<p>But now, was there any tie-in to the assassination by <ent type='ORG'>the Military</ent>?
Absolutely! <ent type='PERSON'>James</ent> Powell, a military intelligence agent, made the
mistake of going into the <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> <ent type='ORG'>School Book</ent> Depository before it
was sealed off by police. And once it was, he had to show his
credentials before he could get out. So he became part of the
permanent record. And you may well ask: What was an <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> intelligence
agent doing in <ent type='ORG'>the School Book</ent> Depository at the time of the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>
Assassination? You might also ask why he was outside taking
photographs of the <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> <ent type='ORG'>School Book</ent> Depository Building at the
time of the assassination when most people were not even aware of
what had gone on, or who was involved, or even of the fact that the
<ent type='ORG'>School Book</ent> Depository would be identified as the place where the
sniper had fired from. .....</p>

<p> [brief discontinuity due to tape ending]</p>

<p>..... [photos] taken six and eight minutes after the assassination
took place. And they show that there's still somebody up there
moving boxes on the sixth floor. The other key thing that I would
point to was found in the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> Police files. We have Lieutenant
<ent type='PERSON'>Rebell</ent> of the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> Police. He went back to police headquarters
from <ent type='ORG'>the Book</ent> Depository and typed up a list of Book Depository
employees. And this was done within, probably, thirty minutes after
the assassination -- even before they had <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> arrested. And
HEADING the list of <ent type='ORG'>School Book</ent> Depository employees was Harvey Lee
<ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>. And it gave his address as 605 <ent type='PERSON'>Elsbeth</ent>. Okay? Now, the
problem is, of course, as we know, it was <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent>. And
his address that he gave in his application for employment to the
Book Depository was the <ent type='LOC'>West Fifth</ent> address of the <ent type='PERSON'>Paine</ent> house out
in <ent type='ORG'>Irving</ent>, where his wife was staying. Okay? Nowhere on his records
at <ent type='ORG'>the Book</ent> Depository was this <ent type='PERSON'>Elsbeth</ent> address. In fact, <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>
HAD lived at 60'2' <ent type='PERSON'>Elsbeth</ent> in the late fall of '62 and early '63,
but he did not put that down on any of his material at <ent type='ORG'>the Book</ent>
Depository. So where did the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> Police <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> Chief <ent type='PERSON'>Rebell</ent>
get this "Harvey Lee <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>" and where did he get "60'5' <ent type='PERSON'>Elsbeth</ent>"?</p>

<p>Well, he told <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> that he rode back from Dealey
Plaza to the police station with a military intelligence agent.
Recently, he told a news reporter down here in <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> that not only
was this a military intelligence agent, he was an O.N.I. agent,
Office of Naval <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent>. And, of course, it's been well-<ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>epted that if <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> played some role in intelligence, he
probably started off in <ent type='ORG'>the Office</ent> of Naval <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent>, since he
was a <ent type='ORG'>Marine</ent>, and the <ent type='NORP'>Marines</ent> are under the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> Department. Okay?</p>

<p>Now, in 1978, <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Select <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent></ent> on <ent type='ORG'>Assassinations</ent> contacted
a Colonel <ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent> of Fourth <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent>. And he said that on
the day of the assassination he got word from some of his people
in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> that they had arrested a fellow and that his name was
<ent type='PERSON'>Alex</ent> J. <ent type='GPE'>Heidel</ent>. He told <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> that he checked with Fourth <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent>
Military <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> files and found that <ent type='PERSON'>Alex</ent> J. <ent type='GPE'>Heidel</ent> cross-referenced to <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent>, and it gave his address as "60'5'
<ent type='PERSON'>Elsbeth</ent>. So the SAME mistaken address that turned up on Lieutenant
Rebell's <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> Police <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> sheet of <ent type='ORG'>School Book</ent> Depository
employees turns up in Fourth <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> files. And <ent type='PERSON'>Rebell</ent>
says he rode back to <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> Police Headquarters with an O.N.I agent.</p>

<p>Now -- what does that tell us? That tells us that it was the
MILITARY in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, on November the 22nd, that was tipping off the
<ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> Police that the suspect they were after was <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
That's DYNAMITE material! By God, if that ..... I don't think that
people know HOW important this information is! This clearly focuses
-- telescopes in on specific areas and people that we should be
paying <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ention to.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Right. And it goes far beyond simply renegades within the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, or
a dissident <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> agent over here, or some Mob hit-men. Now, I don't
think there's any question. It is obvious. There's evidence that
there are <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> people mixed up in the assassination. I think that
if you want to go get hired killers, that's the place where you
would start. I don't think there's any question about that. I don't
think there's any question that there is a <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> involvement in all
of this.</p>

<p>But the thing is -- somewhere it had to come together. Somewhere
there had to be a connecting point. And I believe that <ent type='ORG'>the Military</ent>,
and particularly the groups and the individuals in and around
"Operation Mongoose" probably were this connecting point.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. Let's take a look at a few other people here.
Give us your opinions of what, if any, role the following people
had, or of what knowledge they may have had concerning the
assassination: The fired Bay of Pigs architect, General Charles
<ent type='PERSON'>Cabell</ent>.

JIM MARRS:
Alright. I don't think it was just a coincidence that the day of
the assassination, <ent type='PERSON'>Cabell</ent>, who had been fired by <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> as the
Deputy Director of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, had simply moved back into the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>,
resumed his duties there and his rank there, and, in fact, was kind
of in hot water because he had publicly branded his commander-in-chief, the President of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> F. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>, a traitor.
Okay? If he truly believed that -- and he had to believe that, or
he wouldn't have said that publicly about his superior -- then you
can see that he would have no trouble in justifying the
death sentence for "a traitor". </p>

<p>And I don't think it was a coincidence that his brother, Earl <ent type='PERSON'>Cabell</ent>
was Mayor of <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> that day. As such, he was one of the prominent
and important politicians who helped guide things and make decisions
that were taken in respect to Kennedy's visit there.

<ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. A key piece of evidence. A CRU<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>L piece of evidence that
the media has overlooked. I'd like for you to fill in a blank here.
Absolutely essential:
We know that the route of President Kennedy's caravan was rerouted.
The motorcade was rerouted. Who did that?</p>

<p>JIM MARRS [author of CROSSFIRE: THE P<ent type='ORG'>LOT</ent> THAT KILLED KENNEDY]:
Well, it's a murky question, and you get into all kinds of problems
there. First off, the zig-zag up <ent type='GPE'>Houston</ent> and down Elm Street ....
I'm going to have to admit that Chief <ent type='PERSON'>Terry</ent>[sp], the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> Police
Chief, told <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent> -- they asked him about that
route and he told them that that was the normal flow of traffic.
And that is true. And that's why we're going to have a hard time
with this thing about the route because it was the normal flow of
traffic, and you can always argue that: Well, they followed the
normal flow of traffic.</p>

<p>The problem, of course, is that this was not a normal situation.
This was a President of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States who was visiting. They
had Main Street blocked off already for the motorcade through
downtown. And if I had been in charge of security .... and, in fact,
several of the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> police officers brought this point up to the
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent>. They said that they didn't understand why the
motorcade didn't simply go straight down Main Street, which was
already blocked off, and then turn and go right up onto Stimmons
Expressway, which would have left no need to make a hundred and
twenty degree turn.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
You wouldn't have slowed down because Main Street is a straight
street, and as a straight street, the motorcade would not have had
to slow down. Now, having to turn on procession's path and then
back onto Elm Street, you have two turns which necessitate going
very slow.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Exactly. And one of them -- the turn from <ent type='GPE'>Houston</ent> onto Elm is about
a one hundred and twenty degree turn, which is a VIOLATION of
<ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent> regulations. Now, the only other thing that I'd
point out is that on November the 19th, when <ent type='ORG'>the Secret Service</ent>
chiefs came to <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> and they rode the motorcade route, if you
read their description very closely in <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>
[Report], you find that they came up <ent type='GPE'>Houston</ent> Street to about Main,
and they said: Here is where the motorcade goes on to the Trade
Mart. And they turned east on Main, and they never did drive that
hundred and twenty degree turn onto Elm Street. So there was
apparently some negligence there on really determining the exact
path of the motorcade and realizing that they had a security
problem there. </p>

<p>Now, who engineered that negligence is still kind of up-in-the-air.
But it seems clear to me that since <ent type='ORG'>the Secret Service</ent> and other
<ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> officials ..... In fact, there was a man from the
<ent type='ORG'>Agriculture Department</ent>, believe it or not, who came down and
apparently was an integral, important part of the planning of this
motorcade route. And, of course, you have to go back and understand
that the old <ent type='ORG'>Agriculture Department</ent> head, <ent type='PERSON'>Orville Freeman</ent>, had been
a very close political friend of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lyndon</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent></ent>. And so, there
seems to have been some mechanization that took place in this
planning, but we have not been able to nail that down. And again,
we're back to the point where someone will say: "Well, that was the
natural flow of traffic. So, I think that's going to remain a murky
area in this investigation.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. We do have ....
[interruption due to tape ending]
..... the mayor, Earl <ent type='PERSON'>Cabell</ent>. And Earl <ent type='PERSON'>Cabell</ent> had (we don't know
that it's the case) .... He had the power to reroute the motorcade.
That is something that .....</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
He definitely called Police Chief <ent type='PERSON'>Terry</ent> away from his duties at
the time that they transferred <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>, and he was shot by <ent type='PERSON'>Ruby</ent>. And
<ent type='PERSON'>Terry</ent> said: "I wasn't there because I got a call from Mayor <ent type='PERSON'>Cabell</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
I wasn't aware of that.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Well, there's another possibly important point because if the Police
Chief himself had been there, he might have said something or done
something that would have beefed up the security around <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> and
prevented <ent type='PERSON'>Ruby</ent> from getting to him.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
And, of course, <ent type='ORG'>the American Public</ent> should be aware that <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>
had fired <ent type='PERSON'>Allen Dulles</ent> as head of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, and had vowed to "smash
the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> into a thousand pieces and cast it to the winds." And, of
course, <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> would be on <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent></ent></ent>. Now, to appoint a
man who had been fired seems rather absurd as far as objectivity is
concerned. But, again, nothing about this has been objective or
makes sense.</p>

<p>Now, lastly, I want to go to some of the right-wing extremist
organizations, and also to what some have suspected were some of the
very powerful <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> industrialists who also were in the munitions
business -- the armaments business. And later, as we would find out,
we would be spending nearly ONE BILLION DOLLARS A DAY fighting in
<ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Yeah. And let's not forget the oilmen. The oilmen were not
providing munitions, but they were providing the life blood of the
military machine, which is oil. And so, they very much wanted
<ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent> -- to keep the price of oil up.</p>

<p> [JD: The most famous oilman in the <ent type='ORG'>World</ent> was a <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agent in <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent>
who was involved with the anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent> who have been
linked to the murder of President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>. That famous oilman
had a great deal to gain by the murder of the President because
his <ent type='ORG'>Zapata Oil Company</ent> stood to make a fortune off of the
slaughter in <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent> of over fifty-eight thousand <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> boys.</p>

<p> That famous oilman is George Herbert Walker <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, of course.
Why don't we look at the financial records and find out how much
money George Herbert Walker <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> actually made in that ten-year,
blood-for-profits adventure??]

<ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
And the oilmen were favored friends of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lyndon</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent></ent>.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
That's true. They hated <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> because <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> had already made
one <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>empt to, and was still talking about doing away with the
27-and-a-half percent oil depletion allowance, which is the bedrock
of oil money. What it is, basically, is the argument that oil is a
finite resource. There's only so much of it under ground. And every
time you pump it out, you're depleting your basic product, I guess
you could say. And, as a result, they have a 27-and-a-half percent
(at that time) oil depletion allowance, which basically meant that
they did not have to pay taxes on 27-and-a-half percent of the money
they made off of oil. How would YOU like to be able to pass on
almost 28 percent of your income, and not have to pay taxes on it?
That would help you out considerably. Wouldn't it?</p>

<p> [JD: On this point, it's also important to know that in Kennedy's
first year as President, one of the three major steel companies
-- I think it was <ent type='ORG'>Bethlehem Steel</ent> -- pulled the commonly used
trick of being the first company, in collusion with all the others,
to hike the price of steel and thus, to establish an excuse for
all the other steel companies to hike their prices.
Well, <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> F. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> forced the steel companies, by some means,
to roll back their prices. That was an extraordinary achievement
on behalf of <ent type='ORG'>the American</ent> consumer which has probably never been
done before or since by any of the corporate-owned Presidents of
<ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States.
That deed alone focused upon <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> the hatred of the
barons of big business.]

<ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Do you have any knowledge of <ent type='PERSON'>Howard Hughes</ent> as "Mr. X", and the
suspicions surrounding his involvement in the assassination?
<ent type='PERSON'>Howard Hughes</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ording to information I've got, was considered to
be "Mr. X" by operatives from the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, by some anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent>,
and by some of the right-wing paramilitarists.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
As an intermediary. Well, let me say that in 1963 I was still a
little unclear on how powerful <ent type='ORG'>Hughes</ent> actually was, and on how much
he was actually running his empire. There is good evidence to
believe that he had already begun to be controlled and to be
operated. He was a recluse. Nobody saw him. And there is good reason
to believe that he may not have been in total control of his empire.
BUT, <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> Mayhue was. <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> Mayhue, at that time, was basically
running <ent type='PERSON'>Howard Hughes</ent>'s empire. And <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> Mayhue had ties to both
<ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> and to the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>. And I may point out .... Again, I
think that this is incredibly important: <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> Mayhue was also
tied into "Operation Mongoose".</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Now, is <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> Mayhue alive today?</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Yes, he is.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
What is he doing today?</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
I have no idea what he's doing. He appears on programs now and then.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Was he ever challenged on these ties?</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Oh, heavens. No, there's never been any hard-nosed investigation of
all this because the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> has always maintained that it was
just <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. So, we only have this as supposition, and we have to
acknowledge that it is merely supposition ....</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Well, I would say this. I would say that if there is any one person
still alive today who probably knew and knows how all of this was
pulled together, I think <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> Mayhue would be a good candidate.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. But, again, we do not know that for a fact. We merely have
to, in fairness and objectivity .....
[tape ending]
Did he have any connection to <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent>, and what was his
knowledge of the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Assassination. We must, in fairness and
objectivity, keep it as purely something that is a projected
supposition without concrete evidence.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Oh, there's no concrete evidence that he participated in the
conspiracy to kill <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>. I'll be the first to admit that.
BUT, he himself .... and there has been tons written about him.
He definitely was connected into the ..... In fact, he was the
intermediary who put the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> people in touch with the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> for
their assassination plots. That's been documented. That's been
stated. Okay? That's been nailed down by the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>.</p>

<p>He also, of course, was in charge of the <ent type='PERSON'>Howard Hughes</ent> empire, which
is well documented as being a front for the Central <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>. So, he was right in the thick of all of that. And, as I've
said, he was also part of "Operation Mongoose". That has been
publicly stated. So, I think he's the guy who could give us some
answers, if he would talk, and talk truthfully, and talk
extensively, something that, apparently, he has not done to date.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Now, let's take one more look here and try to put this into a
context. We have certain members of <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> who certainly
could have played a role in providing the actual assassins.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Well, of course, about <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent>, there's really not any
doubt about all of that. The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> was operating as it should, and was
keeping tabs on <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> chieftains. Had them wire-tapped.
Had them followed. Had informants, inside their organizations,
reporting back. And each and every one of them, at some point,
threatened the life of President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>. I think, obviously, the
ones who are most important to us would be <ent type='PERSON'>Sam Giancana</ent>, the Mob
boss of <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>, who apparently helped pull votes for <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> in
the 1960 election, and then who also was dating and going to bed
with Judith [Campbell] Exner at the same time that she was slipping
into the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> and having an affair with <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>.
So that puts him in pretty close contact.

JIM MARRS [author of CROSSFIRE: THE P<ent type='ORG'>LOT</ent> THAT KILLED KENNEDY]:
<ent type='PERSON'>Giancana</ent>, who was under HEAVY, intense prosecution and investigation
by both the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> and the Justice Department, undoubtedly felt like
he was the victim of a turnaround -- a double-cross, if you will.
Of course, his son and his nephew, I believe it was, in fact, have
written a book called "DOUBLE-CROSS". And I think they aggrandize
Giancana's role in national affairs a bit. But nevertheless, they
made the argument that he felt like he had helped to put <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> in
office, and he felt that <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> had double-crossed him by
prosecuting him and sending the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> after him. </p>

<p>Of course, one of his compatriots at that time was the <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent>
crime boss, <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Carlos</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent></ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Davis</ent> has produced a very good
book that pretty well shows that there was some connection with
<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Carlos</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent></ent> into the assassination. <ent type='PERSON'>Davis</ent> tries to make the
argument that <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent> was the architect of the assassination.
He may have been very instrumental in it, but even <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Carlos</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent></ent>,
powerful as he may be, did not have the power to cover-up the facts
afterwards. And he did not have the power to misguide, misdirect
and blunt the investigation by the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>, and to alter the wounds on
the President's body between <ent type='ORG'>Parkland</ent> Hospital and <ent type='GPE'>Bethesda</ent> Naval
Hospital, and to do all of the things that are KNOWN to have been
done. This goes beyond <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent>, although <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Carlos</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent></ent>
may have played an important role.</p>

<p>The other [compatriot of <ent type='PERSON'>Giancana</ent>], of course, was <ent type='PERSON'>Santos</ent>
Trafficante, the Mob chieftain in <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent>, who was closely connected
to the anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent>, who, in fact, had been jailed on the
Isle of Pines by [<ent type='NORP'>Cuban</ent> Premier] Fidel <ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> back at the time of
his takeover, and who was in contact with <ent type='ORG'>JACK RUBY</ent>. </p>

<p>So, you've got all of these people and they're all tied together.
And the common point, I would think, between all of these was the
point to where they begin to work closely with <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>, particularly the Central <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> and the
Military, and the war against <ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent>, and in the assassination plot
against <ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Okay. That's a good summary for this stage of our program. We still
have more to go. There's still a <ent type='ORG'>LOT</ent> more evidence that we're going
to be laying out. We're going to talk about a killing on Wall
Street. We're going to talk about <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> and the oilmen. We're
going to talk about a <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> prophet. We're going to talk about a
bullet for the general. We're going to talk about the connections
with <ent type='PERSON'>Lyndon</ent> Baines <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent>.
So much more to come.
And then in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>: the black car chase, the strange saga of Roger
Craig, the role of hit-men down there, and the shooting of J.D.
Tippett. All these things are still to come, plus the "mystery man"
whom many of us feel was the actual hit-man against <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> in the
balcony of the theater -- how that came about, who this person was,
and why he didn't manage to get to kill <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> who was where he was
supposed to be in that theater, even though he never went to movies,
and was specifically located by the police.
Plus, brand new information that has NEVER before been revealed,
in ANY form, in this country -- coming up.
We are having some outside experts -- physicists and ballistics
people and others -- examining documentation at this very moment.
We'll hopefully have that for you very shortly.</p>

<p>I want to thank you very much, <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Marrs</ent>, for sharing some
outstanding insights with us today.</p>

<p>JIM MARRS:
Thank you. Good to be with you.

<ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
I've spent a great deal of time down in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. In the last year
alone, I've made eight trips, doing measurements -- DETAILED
measurements -- going over analyses. There is an individual
(I don't know if you know him, <ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harris</ent>), <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> Morningstar,
who has done a great deal of analyzing of the <ent type='PERSON'>Zapruder</ent> Film. </p>

<p>We found additional distortions -- editing in that film. We
have also found more tracers. We have found the actual tracers.
We put it through an infra-red scanner, and we can actually
SHOW ..... No one has ever done this before. It was <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent>
Morningstar who came up with this, and we have independently
corroborated it. We've done blow-ups of the <ent type='PERSON'>Zapruder</ent> Film showing
the actual tracer[s] [of the] bullets. And you cannot see it with
the naked eye. But every bullet that is fired has a different
marking, a marking of the heat that is created when the bullet
spins out of the barrel of the gun, a marking of the heat when the
sun reflects off of the bullet, a marking of the heat when the
bullet goes through the atmosphere. And in this case, it was very
humid on that day in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. (I have gone back to subsequently
check all the weather reports.) You have four separate markings
of a tracer.</p>

<p>Well, we know that these markings, though not shown to the naked
eye, are on the film and would still be a permanent imprint.
And based upon the idea that there were multiple gunmen -- not one
-- the only way to determine this is if there were multiple shots
that could be proved to have been fired. Up to this point,
there were none [proven to be fired]. </p>

<p>Using an infra-red technology, we have isolated and actually
identified the exact trajectory of all of the bullets: eight --
EIGHT bullets. Now, what is interesting is that we actually have
this, blown up. It is irrefutable. Any physicist will show you
that these are exact. Also, when you time-base them for the sounds
[compare the points in time of the appearances of the tracers
with the points in time of the sounds of the shots] .... We can't
pinpoint the exact [origin of a] sound because the sound is deceptive.
Where you think the direction that a sound is coming from frequently
is not, depending upon the acoustics. Well, we've been able to match
the acoustics with the sound, and then match the trajectory.</p>

<p>We even found .... I shouldn't say "I found". It was actually
<ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> who found .... We actually found and were able to demonstrate
that the <ent type='PERSON'>Zapruder</ent> Film was cut in two places to make the car seem
as if it lurched forward, when, in fact, it came TO A STOP! And we
can prove that because, in the film, the flags [mounted on the car]
go fl<ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>id and yet, the car jerks forward. And the building right
across from the car -- which should have been in perfect alignment
-- in the very next FRAME (You're talking about less than one
thirty-second of a second) the building <ent type='ORG'>JUMPED</ent> FORTY FEET AHEAD!
So, suddenly, if you look, the building that is across from the
President's limousine -- in one frame is in front of it [the
limousine]; in the next frame there's a forty foot difference.</p>

<p>Now, no one has ever done this work before. This is important new
work to prove that the <ent type='PERSON'>Zapruder</ent> Film WAS definitely, unequivocally,
ABSOLUTELY [altered]. And NO ONE has caught it! NO ONE, except
<ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> Morningstar.</p>

<p>So then we went into great detail. We then took this -- <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> and
I working together -- we blew up these ..... I went down there and
got very sophisticated measurements. And we found that there HAD
to have been someone on the opposite side of the green, because
two bullets came right across and you can see the TRACER come right
across that sign. Now isn't it interesting: They've added a whole
segment to that sign! </p>

<p>Then, we can show that two bullets missed the car entirely.
We do not believe that missing the car by such a wide margin was an
<ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ident. We believe that those were marker shots, because guess
what we see in one of the tree branches. We see a "shooter's bag".
In one shot [frame] you see it there. It looks like a tiny dot.
You won't notice it! The naked eye will not notice it. But blow it
up, as we did, freeze-frame it, and then you will see that it's
hanging in a limb in one shot [frame], and then the tracer shot
comes across and [the "shooter's bag"] it's blown away. That's what
a marksman uses to line up the target, so that when the target comes
right to that spot, you shoot and you're able to hit your target.</p>

<p>We also were able to blow up and enhance a photo showing,
absolutely, a rifle with a telescopic sight that did NOT fire --
that was in the bushes down near the underpass. And we feel that
that was either the kill shot, through the throat, because when it
passed ..... It was funny because you watch it twenty times; you
don't see a thing. You have experts watch it; they don't see a
thing. You slow it down; they don't see a thing. And THEN, we put
it in freeze-frame, and we say: "Have you ever seen a branch of a
tree move?" And suddenly they all say: "There it is!" And they all
point and say: "Yes, you're right!" But then, it's not a branch,
but it's a telescopic sight. And it's a man with a hat. And we can
actually match the scope to the type of scope used in that time.
The scope follows President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> clear around until he's out of
sight, meaning that he was going to put another shot into him if he
saw that the shot they fired the first time wasn't a kill shot.

<ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
This program is a continuation of our ongoing series titled:
"Hidden Agendas: Conspiracies, Cover-Ups and <ent type='EVENT'>Lies</ent>"
at the highest levels of our <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>, in regard to deceptions
foisted upon <ent type='ORG'>the American</ent> People regarding essential information
about the roles of <ent type='PERSON'>Jack Ruby</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent> in the <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> F.
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> Assassination. We have been led to believe that the <ent type='PERSON'>Warren</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent> Report was the first and last word on this case.
Many individuals are challenging that. We have invited those
individuals to share with us insights, documentation and other
information, much of it being revealed here, for the first time,
to <ent type='ORG'>the American</ent> People.</p>

<p>Please excuse the poor broadcast quality today because I am not in
the studio. I'm not in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>. I'm about five thousand miles away
from <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>, continuing to do investigations on this. I'm tracking
certain ballistic and forensic information, and I'm interviewing
people who, hitherto, have not been heard by <ent type='ORG'>the American</ent> People so
that I can bring you new information.</p>

<p>On our conference line right now are two individuals who have some
unique insights: Jack Schweick[sp], who has written on <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent>,
especially about <ent type='ORG'>the Atsugi</ent> [Naval Air] Base in <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>. He was in
intelligence before being in the <ent type='NORP'>Marines</ent>. He has sued the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> for
files. And we'll learn about the alleged fourty-four drawers of
files on <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> and also [on] all the people on that base, and
what <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent></ent> was doing there.</p>

<p>Also, we have colonel L. Fletcher Prouty. Now Colonel Prouty is a
unique individual in this scheme of things. In the movie, <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent>, it
was <ent type='PERSON'>Donald Sutherland</ent> who portrayed the role of L. Fletcher Prouty
or some facsimile of his role. L. Fletcher Prouty was Chief of
Special Operations of <ent type='ORG'>the Joint Chiefs</ent>-of-Staff, and he established
worldwide offices. He was a senior <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> officer, Officer of
Special Operations in <ent type='ORG'>the Office</ent> of the Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> in the
office headed by General G.B. <ent type='PERSON'>Erskine</ent> with <ent type='PERSON'>Edward Lansdale</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>-to-United States <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> on staff. He was also the chief of Team B,
which was Special Operations, Headquarters U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent>.
And that's very important in military terms. Special Operations was
the official function responsible for the military support of the
clandestine operations of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.</p>

<p>Let's begin with L. Fletcher Prouty.
Welcome to our program, Mr. Prouty.</p>

<p>L. FLETCHER PROUTY:
Good morning, <ent type='PERSON'>Gary</ent>. Nice to be with you.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
First off -- is it correct that there was some facsimile between
you and the character portrayed by <ent type='PERSON'>Donald Sutherland</ent> in Oliver
Stone's film, <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent>? </p>

<p>L. FLETCHER PROUTY:
Yes. <ent type='PERSON'>Oliver Stone</ent> met with me in 1990 and asked me to be an advisor
to the film because he had read material that I had written, and he
had written a part into his film that he called "Mr. X". At the
time, I didn't know that. And I read the script when it first came
out in November 1990, and I found the "Mr. X" there and I recognized
myself and words I had written and things I had said. So, at a
speech at <ent type='ORG'>the National Press Club</ent>, in January 1992, <ent type='PERSON'>Oliver Stone</ent>
turned to the audience and said: "Everybody asked me, 'Is there a
real 'Mr. X''." Well, I was on the podium with him, and he turned
and pointed to me and said: "There's my 'Mr. X'." And so, the secret
broke. And that's the story of it. It was pretty simple. He just
worked it into the film so that he would have an authoritative
voice for certain parts of the film, as you saw represented by
<ent type='PERSON'>Donald Sutherland</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. Let's go to the actual events, or at least those events
that you have some insight on so that we can get a handle on this.
We have already -- in the first eighteen parts of this special
investigation (twenty-five hours of broadcasting on this) -- laid out
various aspects of this puzzle. We have seen the role of Organized
Crime -- at least those individuals who, on <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> tapes, have made
statemtents, either true or false (at least they've made the actual
statements), that there was going to be a hit on the President,
either in <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> or later in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. We also had extensive insights
about the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> being "out of control", and about, even at that time,
special renegade elements within the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> who were very much opposed
to President Kennedy's mishandling of <ent type='ORG'>the Bay</ent> of Pigs Invasion, and
about the fact that, at a time when he could very easily have given
the support which would have caused the destruction of Castro's tiny
<ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> and ended what people in the military/industrial complex,
the <ent type='ORG'>Armed Forces</ent>, the general public, the <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> conservative element,
viewed as a substantial threat, he backed off. They found this
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>And, as a result, some feel that elements of that [the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>] were
responsible for the assassination. But it couldn't have been done
without having members of <ent type='ORG'>the Secret Service</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> and the
Military participate because it was going to be, not only the
assassination itself, but they were fully aware that you don't go
out and kill the President of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States unless you can
protect yourself. You have to know that you can protect yourself if
there is a special commission, if there is a special investigation.
So, bringing in people from different segments [of the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>]
at different levels would have been a job that only military
logistics experts could have pulled off. <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> has never
been able to maintain. They don't have the intellectual dexterity,
they have too much braggadocio and they're too unreliable. But they
are capable of killing, and they do. And they are capable of being
used, in effect, as a front for various aspects [of <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>
crime], as they had been in their anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> efforts after the fall
of Cuba's B<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>ista <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>, which supported their corruption.
Since <ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> didn't support them, they were losing many millions of
dollars. So they were conducting regular activities, we now know,
with the aid of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and with the knowledge of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>.

<ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
So, how do you start to link all these disparate people together?
What roles did they actually play? What roles do you surmise they
played?</p>

<p>L. FLETCHER PROUTY:
Well, take one of the most crucial roles. Certainly, everybody
wants to know who killed the President. How was he killed? What was
the technique that was used. And really, the answer has been before
us in the <ent type='ORG'>Press</ent> for years, and I guess most people didn't notice it
or didn't see it in the proper context.</p>

<p>President <ent type='PERSON'>Lyndon</ent> Baines <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent> himself, when ex-President, just
before he died, had an interview with an old friend of his -- a
writer for <ent type='ORG'>the ATLANTIC MONTHLY Magazine</ent>. And, although I don't
have it laying here in front of me at the moment, I'll tell you
three things that <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Lyndon</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent></ent> said during that interview that,
coming from the President, the man who was most involved -- at
least next to <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> -- in that whole affair. <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent> said these
things. He said, first of all: "I never believed that <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> did
that by himself. Furthermore," he said, "I knew that there was a
conspiracy to kill <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>." I mean, he knew as he went along.
I'm not sure that he meant that he knew ahead of time. But, in
either case, those are his words. He said: "I have always felt
that there was a conspiracy to kill <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>." </p>

<p>But third -- and here he really said what answers your question.
He said: "WE", meaning <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> -- "We maintain
a Murder Incorported," and he added the words, "in the <ent type='LOC'>Caribbean</ent>"
because that was pertinent to the questions that were going on.
But this "Murder Incorporated" is <ent type='ORG'>World</ent>wide. And now <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent>
States <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> maintains a "Murder Incorporated" capability, as
we see, from time to time, when assassinations or other tragic
terrorist movements [covert operations] take place. The people who
do that are professionals. And they work for certain elements of
<ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>.</p>

<p>Now, President <ent type='PERSON'>Johnson</ent> said that, and that was printed in the July
1973 issue of <ent type='ORG'>the ATLANTIC MONTHLY Magazine</ent>. Since that has been
put into the <ent type='ORG'>Press</ent>, then we can explore it a little more. Those
professionals whom the [Central <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent>] <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> calls
"mechanics" are brought into <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. A small team. They do the job.
They kill the President. They leave. They're gone. That's the
murder!</p>

<p>The BIG crime after that is the cover story that we see every day.
For instance, this recent release by <ent type='ORG'>the American</ent> Medical
Association is ABSOLUTE COVER STORY! Who IS IT that's forcing that
ENORMOUS organization, that powerful organization, <ent type='ORG'>the American</ent>
Medical Association, just last week or the week before, to release
more cover story articles about the killing of the President that
are NOT true? Why are they being made to do this? Where is the
"power" that makes them do that? Therein is the explanation of
the assassination of the President!</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
Alright. Let's go through this. Who had the power to kill the
President and get away with it. <ent type='ORG'>Organized Crime</ent> could not have done
it and gotten away with it. Anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent>ites could not have done it
and gotten away with it. And radically right-wing, conservative
politicians could not have done it and gotten away with it.
So who actually did it, and then who do you think ..... Separate
the cast of characters whom you feel did it, and then the cast of
characters who participated in the cover-up because whoever did it
had to have enough power to get the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> to participate [in the
cover-up] because we know ABSOLUTELY, <ent type='ORG'>UNEQUIVOCALLY</ent> -- it is a
m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er of LAW and it is a m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er of sworn testimony that the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>
participated systematically in covering up, destroying, hiding
information that was absolutely essential to the investigation.
They participated in a crime at ALL levels, including the very
highest level with J. Edgar <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent>. Now, you do not get J. Edgar
<ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> to consistently commit crimes, to break the laws
which they're supposed to be there to defend unless you're very
powerful. <ent type='ORG'>WHO</ent>, then, is more powerful than the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>? And who is
more intimidating than J. Edgar <ent type='ORG'>Hoover</ent> who could get that done?</p>

<p>L. FLETCHER PROUTY:
This is one of the questions that <ent type='PERSON'>Oliver Stone</ent> ran into as he was
developing the script and the concept of this movie, because there
aren't many of us in this country, in this <ent type='ORG'>World</ent> who <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ept the fact
that there are power centers. <ent type='PERSON'>Winson Churchill</ent> called this power
center, during <ent type='ORG'>World</ent> War II, when he was talking with intimate
friends (This is written. This is clearly available to researchers)
.... He called it a "high <ent type='ORG'>cabal</ent>". <ent type='PERSON'>Winston Churchill</ent> is talking
about a higher <ent type='ORG'>cabal</ent> than <ent type='PERSON'>Winston Churchill</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Frank</ent>lin D. <ent type='PERSON'>Roosevelt</ent>
and <ent type='PERSON'>Josef Stalin</ent>. He is talking about a power center, a "power
elite" that is ABOVE governments.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Buckminster Fuller</ent>, a man who had enormous experience with
governments .... he spent more time as a consultant to the <ent type='ORG'>Kremlin</ent>
than any other non-<ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent>. He spent hours and hours and days as a
consultant to <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> in our country. <ent type='PERSON'>Buckminster Fuller</ent> was a man
of great experience. He wrote a book that we should ALL know called
"CRITICAL PATH". In that book, he speaks over and over and over again
about the "power elite". I've written a book about [titled]
"THE SECRET TEAM".

[some words lost when Prouty's phone line is cut off for
a few seconds]</p>

<p>.... because I myself have worked with people, in their own homes,
like [Eisenhower's Secretary of State] <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Foster <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> and
[Director of Central <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent>] <ent type='PERSON'>Allen Dulles</ent>. I have seen <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent>
Foster <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> pick up a special telephone. He didn't dial. He didn't
say anything except: "I want" so-and-so. And you could tell by the
name that it was a <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> name -- a man in <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>. They talked for
a little while. He said "Thank you," hung up the phone and we went
right ahead with business. He had settled something.

COLONEL L. FLETCHER PROUTY:
There are people above our <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> structure. And when those
power groups are threatened by a regime such as that which the
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>s were establishing in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> (their own power center),
one of them has to give. And the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>s lost that one. So, we
have to <ent type='ORG'>acc</ent>ept that a "power elite" DOES exist. It's existing today.
And it keeps the cover story alive. That's bigger than the crime
itself because the cover story is covering the way our <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>,
the way our lives are run today. Look around and see.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>GARY</ent> NULL:
So, in other words, it's your feeling, based upon insider
information .... because you were an insider's insider. You were
Chief of Special Operations to <ent type='ORG'>the Joint Chiefs</ent> of Staff. I mean,
you don't get any closer to the heart of the intelligence community
than that. Certainly, not at the <ent type='ORG'>Armed Forces</ent> level. And you were
also a senior <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> officer in <ent type='ORG'>the Office</ent> of Special Operations
at <ent type='ORG'>the Office</ent> of the Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>. And you were the liaison
with the Central <ent type='ORG'>Intelligence</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> in clandestine operations
[between the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent>]. So we have to trust that
your insights are unique.</p>

<p>So, you're telling us, very literally, that beyond the three
branches of our United States <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> there is a "power" <ent type='ORG'>cabal</ent>
made up of individuals who represent industry, government and
business (within that, the world of high finance) who can make a
phone call and kill a story, make a phone call and take out a
contract, can put into motion any kind of effort that they deem
essential for THEIR economic or personal well-being, and that they
are beyond the law because they control all offices. They control
the Attorney-General of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States, who is a political
appointee. And that's been relatively simple. Virtually all of the
Attorney-Generals, with the exception of two in the last thirty
years, have been extraordinarily reprehensible people. The "power"
<ent type='ORG'>cabal</ent> controls the <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> Bureau of Investigation, because we had
a very peculiar man running the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> who had his own set of values.
They can control politicians. They control the Mass Media, which is
relatively simple because most, not all, of the Media are owned by
major corporations. </p>

<p>So, what you're saying is that these people [of the "power' <ent type='ORG'>cabal</ent>]
are simply a law unto themselves, and they stay out of the
spotlight, they don't seek publicity, but they do seek power.
And they maintain power through economic power. And they see to it
that they win, no m<ent type='ORG'>att</ent>er what happens, on any level.
Is that what you're telling us?</p>

<p>L. FLETCHER PROUTY:
<ent type='PERSON'>Gary</ent>, you're telling the story pretty straight. Let me add
something. It may sound kind of small and precise. But it's exactly
the kind of example that just draws a line under what you've said.</p>

<p>I happened to be in <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>, on the way back from the South
Pole, when I heard about President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> being killed. And I just
heard that as a momentary flash over the radio. And, since I was
transient there, I didn't have the radio to keep listening. I went
out on the street and I looked for a newspaper. Before long, the
local paper in <ent type='ORG'>Christ Church</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> printed The <ent type='ORG'>Star</ent> as an
extra. And on the front page of The <ent type='ORG'>Star</ent>, there was a large picture
of <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>, of course. And on the other side of the page, across
from that, there was a picture of the building, the <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> School
Book Depository that we've all heard about now, where the killer
was supposed to have been firing from. And, as I looked at that
picture, I saw that many windows were open. Now this was a picture
taken in real time. In other words, it was taken at the time that
the murder happened, or very close to that. And the picture was
flashed, by radio, around the <ent type='ORG'>World</ent>. And I turned to a congressman
who was with me, and I said: "Look, there's something wrong in
<ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. The protective organization that we have in <ent type='ORG'>the Military</ent>
and <ent type='ORG'>the Secret Service</ent>, would NEVER have permitted overlooking
windows to be open when the President goes by."</p>

<p>Well, you see, there is an organization within <ent type='ORG'>the Military</ent> that is
trained for what we call the protection of the President. And one
of their jobs is to close windows in overlooking buildings, and so
on and so forth. But I found out, when I got back to <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent>
States, that the organization that should have been in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>
protecting the President had SOMEHOW been called by somebody who
knew the system, who knew the code words. And the commandant, the
commanding officer of that organization, had been told: "You're not
needed in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. We're going to have another unit in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>." And
this is routine. There are many units. So he didn't go to <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>.
But then he found out that NOBODY ELSE was there. <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> was OPEN!</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent> was not there at Dealey Plaza where the President
was killed. There were FALSE <ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent> people there. There
were FALSE military officers there. There were FALSE policemen
there. We have <ent type='ORG'>PHOTOGRAPHS</ent> of them. There are these photographs of
"the tramps" that a lot of people have seen, showing the policeman
in front of them and the policeman in back of them, leading them to
the sheriff's office. If you look carefully, the two policemen in
the photographs have different uniforms on. They are ACTORS!
The "tramps" are actors! And, if you've been in the business of
protecting the President, you KNOW that things like that
don't happen.</p>

<p>Now, there are only a FEW people who would KNOW -- who would have
the authority to tell those units that have been specially trained
to protect the President -- to tell them NOT to do their jobs!
It's like a fireman. You don't tell a fireman NOT to go when the
bells ring and the fire is across the street. He's trained to do it.
But suppose somebody said: "Don't go. There's going to be another
fire truck." That requires "power" from the top. That defines what
you were just talking about, <ent type='PERSON'>Gary</ent>, and what I was talking about.
That defines the "power elite" who can come from the top and
nullify things. There's where the power is.

<p><ent type='GPE'>BOSTON</ent> (<ent type='GPE'>UPI</ent>) -- A newly dedicated statue of President <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> F.
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> in front of the Statehouse on <ent type='ORG'>Beacon Hill</ent> will be returned to
its foundry to clean graffiti from the memorial, officials said Tuesday.
A man apparently obsessed with the late actress <ent type='PERSON'>Marilyn Monroe</ent>
claimed responsibility for spray-painting white splotches of paint and
the word "murderer'' on the 8-foot bronze statue over the weekend.
Workers using a mild acid were able to hose the paint off the base
of the memorial, but did not <ent type='ORG'>att</ent>empt to treat the statue itself.
"They are going to move it,'' said <ent type='PERSON'>Greg Arnold</ent>, superintendent of
state office buildings. "They're going to take it back to the foundry
and try to put additional protection on it.''
<ent type='PERSON'>Arnold</ent> said the cleansers used on the base of the memorial were not
suitable for the statue. "It's a stone wash, and you can't do that to
the bronze and the patina of the statue.''
Noel <ent type='PERSON'>Dan</ent>forth, a spokeswoman for the legislative commission that
oversees the memorial, said the statue would be sent to the Tallix
Foundry in <ent type='GPE'>Beacon</ent>, N.Y.
"It's about a three to four week process, depending on how much
work they have to do on it and if they have to repatinate it,'' <ent type='PERSON'>Dan</ent>forth
said.
No estimate for the amount of damage to the statue was immediately
available. The statue was to be removed Wednesday, <ent type='PERSON'>Arnold</ent> said.
The defacement took place on the 28th anniversary of Monroe's
suicide. The blond sexpot has been linked romantically to <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> in
published reports in recent years.
"The caller stated ... 'Why don't you take a wild look at the <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent>
statue in front of the Statehouse. The m----------r murdered <ent type='PERSON'>Marilyn Monroe</ent>,
now it's his turn,'' said Capt. <ent type='PERSON'>Paul Mahoney</ent>, commander of the Capitol
Police, which oversees state government buildings and grounds.
The statue, which depicts a striding <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>, was dedicated May 29
on what would have been Kennedy's 73rd birthday.</p>
