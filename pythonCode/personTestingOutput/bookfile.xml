<p>LAWYERS/<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>/MOB/<ent type='PERSON'>BUSH</ent> -----&gt; RAPE/MURDER/DRUG SMUGGLE/STEAL </p>

<p>Part A:</p>

<p>Lawyers have amassed into a worldwide coalition to dominate the world in the
tradition of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='GPE'>Bavaria</ent>n <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent></ent>. Back in the 1800's they managed to gain
control of <ent type='NORP'>Amerika</ent> by planting their seeds in the Executive, Legislative, and
Judi<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l branch of U.S. Now separation of powers of the 3 branches exists only
on the hemp paper the Constitution was written on. Oh, and they managed to make
hemp illegal because their buddies own chemical and logging industries that
hemp paper was and can put out of business because it grows 20 times faster,
makes better paper, and needs fewer chemicals to process into paper! They
turned U.S. politics into a morbid game for money. In 1700's our founders
warned us of political parties and hired farmers for presidents who did not use
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> hitmen to topple foreign regimes for private business concerns. (Bush's
international construction company builds oil refineries in Saudi <ent type='GPE'>Arabia</ent>!*!*!)
Big brother is nothing more than a four eyed wimp called <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> with a
lust for megabucks. Death to all who oppose the villain - ex-head of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> -
turned US Pres! But he made a terrible mistake. He called a war on drugs,but
his <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> has imported Heroin from <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent> for half a century and brought Coke into
the US on <ent type='LOC'>Air</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Amerika</ent> planes coming back from <ent type='ORG'>Contra Arms</ent> deliveries in Central
<ent type='NORP'>Amerika</ent>!</p>

<p>IMPEACH <ent type='PERSON'>BUSH</ent> NOW - HE'S A DOPE DEALER BETTER YET HANG HIM HIGH FOR TREASON for
working in the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> when they killed <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> so they could escalate the Viet
Nam War and sell heroin to soldiers and JP4 fuel and military jets/helicopters
to U.S. TAXPAYERS! </p>

<p>**** SEND THIS TO YOUR FRIENDS AND CONGRESSMAN/WOMAN AND TELL HER/HIM YOU WANT
<ent type='PERSON'>BUSH</ent> IMPEACHED TODAY AND NO EXCUSES !!!
BESIDES, QUALE WOULD HAVE TROUBLE ESCALATING A BAR FIGHT BY DIALING 911
- HE COULDN'T START A WAR!!!
(MANY UNCONFIRMED THEORIES FORMULATE THAT IF <ent type='PERSON'>BUSH</ent> WERE TO LOSE HIS LIFE OR GET
ROUND FILED, THE <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> WOULD HAVE TO ASSASINATE QUALE)

<p>Part B:(Some facts and logical conclusions about lawyers)</p>

<p> "AN AMERICAN TYRANNY,"
by David C. Morrow:</p>

<p>LAWYERS MAKE THE LAWS, JUDGE THE LAWS, BREAK THE LAWS, <ent type='GPE'>FUDGE</ent> THE LAWS
----------------&gt; SHOULDN'T THIS CHANGE?
Slave owners often helped themselves to their female property and medieval
lords showed their ability to dominate and degrade by having serfs' brides
spend their wedding nights with them and not the grooms.
<ent type='ORG'>The California</ent> State Bar's Standing Committee on Professional Responsibility
and Conduct has recently decided that "a lawyer-client sexual relationship"
does not impair the lawyer's ability "to competently perform the legal services
required."
"A ban on any sexual relationship with a client," the gentlemen of the Bar
concluded, "appears overly broad and unnecessary." Like <ent type='ORG'>the Alaska Bar</ent>
Asso<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>tion and, a few years ago, its <ent type='GPE'>Oregon</ent> counterpart, they ruled it
perfectly fine for lawyers to have sex with women (or men) they represent.
Much criticism of lawyers has come from men trying to reform divorce laws
that give wives at least half a man's property, most of his future income, and
child support without enforced visitation. The accusation is that attorneys,
in legislative offices deliberately make laws that bribe women to divorce in
order to generate cases and that judges, themselves lawyers, assign custody to
women because of evidence showing that maternal more than paternal custody
results in juvenile delinquency. That divorcees may not enjoy as high a living
standard as they anticipate is of no concern to the lawyers.
While these observations can be supported by findings of such established
researchers as <ent type='ORG'>the Kettering</ent> Foundation and the <ent type='ORG'>FBI Crime</ent> report, there are
broader implications.
<ent type='GPE'>Minnesotan</ent> R. F. Doyle, while researching the law's abuse of marriage, came
across a telling article in the September 17, 1975 "<ent type='ORG'>Philadelphia Inquirer</ent>".
Participants in a <ent type='ORG'>Philadelphia Bar</ent> Asso<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>tion meeting voted against marijuana
decriminalization. No health reasons were cited; instead the prominent attorney
A. <ent type='PERSON'>Charles Peruto</ent> said that lawyers needed marijuana cases for personal profit.
One need but recall how prostitution, pornography, and other vices are usually
tolerated except during election year when incumbents need to demonstrate their
"effectiveness" and raise extra revenues while scratching one another's backs.
More recently, victims of violent crimes by repeat offenders have begun to
speak out against lenient judges and parole boards who do not keep dangerous
offenders locked up. Each retrial means money for lawyers, judges and a host of
court employees, and who better to guarantee retrials than habitual criminals?</p>

<p>"SINCE LAWYERS OCCUPY ALL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT,
THE SEPARATION OF POWER EXISTS ONLY ON PAPER!!!"</p>

<p> To test the lawyer conspiracy theory a few years ago, I sent to various
state legislatures for copies of their statistics. While <ent type='GPE'>Idaho</ent> listed only
eight of 105 legislators as lawyers in 1983, I discovered that in <ent type='GPE'>Wisconsin</ent>,
for example, eleven of thirty-one senators and twelve of ninety-nine
representatives were attorneys. During that time, seventeen of Alabama's
thirty-five senators and eleven of sixty-five representatives were lawyers.
The <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> State legislature was twenty percent lawyers. Governors, as in
<ent type='GPE'>Wisconsin</ent>, frequently proved to be lawyers.
It would seem that since members of the legal fraternity occupy all branches
of government, the separation of powers exists only on paper. This enables them
to generate cases for profit and the public detriment by making unenforceable
laws, encouraging repeat offenders as long as possible, and appealing to greed
to keep families - and thereby society in general - in disorder. Perhaps,
indeed, most of America's problems are due less to mysterious sociological
factors than to sly legal machinations.
In their zeal to publicly approve their own sexual misbehavior, what lawyers
are really doing is, like slave owners or medieval lords, sneering down at the
rest of us from their pinnacle and flaunting their privileges in the most
degrading and insulting manner. They are also engaging in behavior that causes
so<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l change, espe<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>lly change of ruling classes. It is the signal to take
actions to eliminate their tyranny.
We should exclude attorneys from all legislative and executive positions.
<ent type='ORG'>Office</ent> holders can hire or appoint legal advisers. Judges should be elected,
since appointment, espe<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>lly by professional peers, would be perverted to
favor persons who work to advance their profession and not to secure justice
and so<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l stability. Rather than campaigning, judges should have to publish
their decisions and sentences with complete explanations in ordinary language,
and this information alone should be the basis of the voters' decision to
re-elect or turn them out of office. Since they enjoy immunity from prosecution
for wrongful decisions, judges' punishments for crimes committed while in
office should be extremely severe.
With these and other measures that may be found useful, we can enter the next
century with few so<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l problems, a very high standard of public morality, and
with crimes violent and victimless under a functional measure of control.</p>

<p>Part C:(Some more facts about lawyers and Mr. <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> dude(G.<ent type='PERSON'>BUSH</ent>!))</p>

<p>In the early 1800's, the professional politi<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>ns took over this country and
public office went from "A duty and a privilege" to a profession. A
professional politi<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>n must be a master of words. A lawyer's rhetoric is as
effective as a 357 magnum. Who better to pull off the bloodless coup. Or has it
been blood-less? The civil war devastated the north, the south, and the blacks
had to go to work in polluted northern factories for pennies a day afterwards
(quite handy however for the northern industrial imperialists.) Then the
bluecoats killed off the <ent type='NORP'>Indians</ent> and the buffalo to boot! Then came <ent type='GPE'>Korea</ent>, Nam,
Graneda, <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>, El Salvador, <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>.
Around 1903 a <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> oil baron had <ent type='PERSON'>Nikolai</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> thrown out of N.Y.
(<ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> was a super inventer of such things as AC current and the <ent type='ORG'>Westinghouse</ent>
electric motor!) It seems <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> had discovered a way to transmit electricity
without wires around NY city! The oilmen knew it would be an end to their
gross profiteering from energy manipulation and tossed <ent type='PERSON'>Nik</ent> outta there!
A book called "The Emperor Wears No Clothes" documents how hemp was
needed to win world wars, but soon after became illegal after oil, logging and
chemical companies realized hemp made better paper with less petro-chemicals
and converted to alcohol easily with extremely high energy per kilo of biomass!
(Cars can run on alcohol just as easily as gas-I know-I raced cars &amp; planes!)
"The Origin of Consciousness In the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind" by
Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Julian Jaynes</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>Princeton</ent> U., shows in his book how leaders of the world
have confused us for thousands of years with rhetoric, mysticism, music, &amp;
theology, so as to better manipulate and tax the poor masses.
Then there was the carburetor invented in the 70's that got 100 MPG. All
of a sudden a major U.S. company bought the patent rights to the carb and
locked it away. Think of the pollution we now have that we could have avoided
if a handful of greedy politi<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>ns and oilmen didn't want all of the excess
wealth their oil businesses have afforded them at the cost of our health!
And <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> is an Oil Refinery Contractor from <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>! Remember, the place
where LBJ, <ent type='PERSON'>Carlos Marcello</ent>, and the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> had <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> shot. Oh, but <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was in
the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>! Oh and <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> became the head of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> - the same folks that killed
<ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent> to escalate war and drug profits in <ent type='ORG'>NAM</ent>. A book "The politics of Heroin in
South East <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>" documents the CIA's selling of narcotics to fund operations.
So does the Book "The <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Heroin Empire". HOT NEW BOOK ON DRUGWAR SCAM &amp;
<ent type='ORG'>COUNTERINSUGENCY</ent> IS CALLED "DEEP COVER" BY <ent type='PERSON'>MICHAEL LEVINE</ent> - GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!
Garrison's book, "On the trail of Assassins" shows how <ent type='PERSON'>Oswall</ent> was indeed also a
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agent. Lucky for the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> &amp; <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> that <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> died soon after, along with over
a dozen very important witnessess and suspects who perished for unexplainably
weird reasons within a year of JFK's murder. (And <ent type='PERSON'>David Scheim</ent>'s book "Contract
On <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>" provides the evidence showing how <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> chiefs like <ent type='PERSON'>Marcello</ent> worked
together with the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> to murder <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent>, Robert <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>(he prosecuted MOB Bosses
as JFK's Attorney General), <ent type='PERSON'>Martin Luther King</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Malcom</ent> X(these two were
begining to expose the facts that the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>/MOB drug dealers were taking all the
money from the poor people they sold narcotics to!))
But <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> wants a drug war? But his <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> sells drugs(hard narcotics). Let
us impeach <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> for accessory to a felony to import narcotics(He knew about it)
Or impeach him for accessory to JFK's treasonous murder.(It is supreme high
treason to withhold knowledge of a conspiracy to kill a U.S. President - and
treason carries the death penalty!)
<ent type='PERSON'>Hoover</ent> ran the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> at the time the killing and helped the coverup. Such
twisted justice can be found described in Turner's book, "Hoover's <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>."
Ex-<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agents have written books like "The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> File" and "Deadly Deceits" which
further documents the ruthless activities of drug smuggling and crime by
the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> abroad and at home. (U.S. law strictly forbids <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> operation in U.S.)
"The Cocaine Wars" explains that the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> now imports South <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Cocaine
into U.S. The <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>s do too, but then they also work for the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> in many areas
like drug smuggling, assassinations, and other clandistine, cloak and dagger
dirty work no longer needed in the global world of the nineties!
According to the book "Poisoning for Profit," by <ent type='ORG'>Block</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Scarpitti</ent>, the
<ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>s basically own the nations waste disposal companies and have dumped toxic
waste illegally into U.S. water supplies for decades. If the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>
work together, then who is committing crimes against the U.S. now?
I would say that the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>/Oil/<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>/<ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> connection poses the most threat
to U.S. national security for choking US with oil pollution in <ent type='LOC'>Air</ent> and Water,
killing our presidents, poisoning our water with toxic waste, and getting our
kids hooked on Smack, Coke and Crack - and all for their love of $.
Hell, these guys make the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> look about as dangerous as a Cub Scout Pack
loaded with water balloons!
But these same guys control the news services too! No one ever hears any
of this. But then no one reads non-fiction books any more either! These books
are all available at a good college or city library to read for free! Just when
<ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> grabbed the headlines months ago, the <ent type='ORG'>Gannett news agency</ent> reported in a
small article that mostly <ent type='NORP'>Texans</ent> including G.<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> received over 500000 bucks
from failing S&amp;L's. Great smokescreen(sandscreen) <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>! </p>

<p> Oh, and <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> is a life member of the "Skull and Crossbones Club" which is
the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n equivalent of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='GPE'>Bavaria</ent>n <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent></ent> - the motto of which falls
along the lines of "secrecy or death!" These secret sects were formed by
Lawyers as far back as 1776 to dominate, manipulate and tax the masses!</p>

<p>Part D(Conclusion:)
We the people could all have 2 day work weeks if $.60 out of every $1.00 we
spend did not pay for energy costs they have assessed us soley for their own
gains-this alone is multiple felony counts of interstate fraud/mail fraud by
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> &amp; Company. (<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, &amp; Logging, Oil, Chemical &amp; Finan<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l Industries!)
I propose a new order, not of imperfect, selfish, egotistical humans, but of
and through microprocessors. These machines would not rule the world as most
would expect, but would just aid in applying logic to the production of
solutions to the race's survival.
Data on natural resources, human resources, pollution, et cetera, would be
inputed into a program written in Basic language, open to anyone's inspection,
that would give a committee of non-lawyers/oilmen logical options to take in
handling the affairs of the people. Data input into the Basic interpreter by
the committee would be available to all citizens to duplicate and certify the
committees results.
If the program can be run on anyone's PC, then everyone with a PC could
verify the results the committee obtained so as to make sure that the committee
was not exceeding its own authority. The committee would have to post input
data in newspapers for each problem entered, to allow citizens to duplicate the
committee's findings. If the committee obtained results that differed with the
people's results, the committee would be subject to an audit of their hardware
and software systems until the reason was determined that they obtained
different solutions. This would eliminate the possibility for a virus to be
injected into their system and would eliminate the criminal elements from
tampering with our government for their own personal gains!
With such a system, we no longer would have the personal conflicts of
interest that we presently have with our leaders who are so economically tied
to world events and whose "solutions" are now tainted by such events.</p>

<p>PART II:</p>

<p>HOW POLITI<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>NS/<ent type='PERSON'>ILLUNINATI USE MAFIAS</ent> TO DO THERE DIRTY WORK:</p>

<p>"CONTRACT ON AMERICA" =superexpose on mob/<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>/illuminati <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent>,King,Malcm X hits!</p>

<p>Well go to a good bookstore and aquire the book "Contract On <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>" by
David E Scheim. Paperback versions have 624 pages and cost 4.95 US <ent type='PERSON'>bux</ent>.
This is probably the best single source on "the conspiracy" by our governent
to work with the Mob to take over the U.S.A. and run it for their personal
profit.</p>

<p>Chapter 21 "More Assassinations"
Documents how the Mob killed Martin Luther/<ent type='PERSON'>Malcom</ent> X because the two had
begun to expose how much the Mob profitted off of ghetto Blacks by
selling drugs to the poor People!</p>

<p>Chapter 22 "<ent type='PERSON'>Richard Nixon</ent> and the Mob."
This chapter documents a multitude of conections between <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> and
the Mob/Hoffa/Teamsters/and relatives of such.
(in my opinion, <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> was one of the fuckin greasyest, slimyest, scum
buckets who pretended to work for the People as a "politi<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>n" -
- next to Rea-gun and <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>-wacker of course!)</p>

<p>Chapter 23 "The Reagan Administration"</p>

<p>Obviously deals with <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>/Mob connections that Reagan and his cronies like
G.<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> had in those 8 years of blood sucking!</p>

<p>And now for a quote from page 257 of "Contract On <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>" (read it and weep)</p>

<p> "Organized crime involves itself in the life of every single human being.
It causes prices to be raised; it affects your pocketbook when you go to a
laundry or dry cleaner; the price you pay for food in the market. I have
been involved in and know of bad meat being purchased, unfit for human
consumption, that has been converted into salami in <ent type='GPE'>delicatessens</ent> and
forced to be sold through grocery stores...
When I testified about Mr DeCarlo, I, too, had the native feel of what
organized crime was.
I saw photographs of graves dug in <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent>, with over 35 bodies over
a period of years, melted with lye. I sat and heard the voices at dinner
talking over murdering a 12-year-old child and burying bodies in <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent>...
<ent type='ORG'>Narcotics</ent>, manipulation of businesses that cause prices to spiral, we can
go on for a long, long time. . . .It goes on and on.</p>

<p> Mob defector <ent type='PERSON'>Gerald Zelmanowitz</ent>, testifying
in 1973 before a U.S. Senate committee"</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>BUSH</ent> &amp; THE MOB:</p>

<p>page 594 states "<ent type='PERSON'>Gelli</ent> is also "very well aquainted with Vice-President-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>."
(in Mobese this translates to "the two fuckin worked together")</p>

<p>page367 states "On August 2, 1980, as resort-bound <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> and foreign tourists
crowded Italy's <ent type='GPE'>Bologna</ent> R.R. station, a massive bomb ripped through a waiting
room. The explosion left 85 dead and 200 others injured. It was the worst
terrorist strike in postwar Europe....
....Another defendent in the pending trial(on the bombing) is P2
grandmaster Licio <ent type='PERSON'>Gelli</ent>, now a fugitive believed to be hiding in S <ent type='NORP'>Amerika</ent>.
In 1981, shortly before fleeing multiple criminal indictments, <ent type='PERSON'>Gelli</ent> had
been an honored guest at Reagan's inaugural ball...
...when police raided Gelli's villa in 1981...they found an exchange of
letters between <ent type='PERSON'>Gelli</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Guarino</ent> discussing ways to help "our brother
<ent type='PERSON'>Michele</ent>," refering to <ent type='PERSON'>Sindona</ent>, another P2 member. <ent type='PERSON'>Sindona</ent>, who had curried the
<ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>-<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n vote for <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> as <ent type='PERSON'>Guarino</ent> did for Reagan, was then on trial
in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Gelli</ent> also wrote a letter of support to Reagan offering to ensure
favorable coverage for him in the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> press. The powerful <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> used his
infuence in a major publishing empire to do exactly that....
....the president(Reagan-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>) has countenanced the use of unsavory
partnerships and methods to further a political agenda. Moreover, two policy
developments of his presidency find disturbing counterparts in Mob ideology and
perhaps reflect traces of the Mob's insidious, post-assassination influence on:
1) A classic mob scam is to assume control of a thriving business and drain
its wealth through massive loans based on its previoously good fina<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l
standing. During Reagan's 2 terms, <ent type='NORP'>Amerika</ent>ns have been steered along in an orgy
of consumption that has tripled the national debt from $645 billion to
$2 trillion and turned the world's largest creditor nation into the world's
largest debtor.
2) Organized crime's "ultimate solution to everything is to kill somebody,"
as one defector observed. During the early years of Reagan's presidency,
military force became the prime instrument of U.S. foreign policy. Patterned
after a percieved <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> menace and financed by the ballooning deficit, the
biggest peacetime weapons buildup in U.S. history was conducted. This obsessive
reliance on weaponry was no better exhibited than in the 1985 covert U.S. arms
sale to <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> - obstensibly a good-will gesture - while that nation was known
to be sponsoring terrorism against <ent type='NORP'>Amerika</ent>n citizens."</p>

<p>"<ent type='PERSON'>Deep Cover</ent>", by <ent type='PERSON'>Michael Levine</ent> (an expose of the

is out in paperback for $6.00. Seems pretty good
reading, and should provide lots of ammunition for
those of us trying to end this "drug war" madness.</p>

<p>(Standard plug: legalized drugs could bring in on
the order of $100 *<ent type='ORG'>BILLION</ent>* a year in tax revenues,
the best chance to reduce the deficit and pull us

little fanatical, but they are the only ones around who will stand up to
the B.S. that has suppressed so many others, and are the only ones who dare
expose the <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent> and live to talk about it!</p>

<p>NOW FOR THE SUM OF A MAN'S KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE <ent type='ORG'>ILLUMINATI</ent>:</p>

<p>These folks are more secret than <ent type='PERSON'>Moussad</ent>(the <ent type='NORP'>Israeli</ent> SS) who is the
undisputed ultimate "secret agent men/women" experts of the world.
Therefore, you will find no reliable sources of information on them.

They like to frequent <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> chalets and spend their loot on good
spirits and women. Oh, they do not have women for members.

Their asso<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>tes are in international banking and are world leaders of
organized crime. But they are not ever necessarily top world leaders or
top CEO's, but they completely influence the major decisions of most
multinational companies and world leaders.

They are always there but you never see them:

Once, at a coffee shop in an affluent <ent type='GPE'>Denver</ent> 'burb in the foothills, I ran
across a man of this general authority. With a <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> accent, he had told
me that if I were to sit at a table, I was to buy coffee, but he did not
work there. He wore a $2000 <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> pilot's chronometer on one wrist. His
clothes cost at least half of the watch and he wasn't wearing a suit!
We were just waiting for the rain to stop and I could not believe my ears
when he tried to shoo me away from my dry spot under the curbside table's
canvas awning. I thought carefully and then replied something to the likes
of "The <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent> would always like for me to be recirculating my money
back into their economic system of manipulation."

As soon as I said this, never mind the weather, he took off. He was a
strong 50 year old <ent type='NORP'>Aryan</ent>, about 6'1", 200lbs, to my 5'11", 150lbs
but he looked extremely agitated before he left. I could tell he was not
physically scared of me. In fact, he knew all too well what I was saying about
the global economic policies of his "asso<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>tes" in the <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent>. You see,
they have so effectively cut off information about even their existence, that
it will damn near give one of them vapor lock if you call their hand!
(Notice that Europe houses the ultimate banks next to <ent type='GPE'>Bavaria</ent> on <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> soil,
and note how the <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> are given <ent type='ORG'>International Neutrality</ent> to boot so that
the Secret accounts will be safe and stable! I would wager a month of <ent type='LOC'>Sundays</ent>
that money in a <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> account is backed by real gold too!)

<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> belongs to the "Skull and Crossbones Club" which is the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n
Equivalent of the <ent type='ORG'>Illuninati</ent>. You have to study at <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> and be in a family that
is part of the old boy system and then you might get in. It is highly secret,
but really is much more well known than the <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent>. It exists to perpetuate
the existence of the old boys in <ent type='NORP'>Amerika</ent>, much as the <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent> does the same
in Europe.

Amazingly, the only reference to the <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent> that I have ever seen other
than in a few paper back books on mysticism called the Trilogy which actually
are probably right 50% of the time, was in <ent type='ORG'>the Unabridged Webster</ent>'s Dictionary,
where all it dares say is that they were "the members of an anticlerical,
deistic, republican society founded in 1776 by <ent type='PERSON'>Adam Weishaupt</ent>, professor of
law at <ent type='GPE'>Ingolstadt</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Bavaria</ent>. It was suppressed by the <ent type='GPE'>Bavaria</ent>n government in
1785: called also the Order of the <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent>."

I suppose they had to go deep undercover, much more so than even the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>.
This might explain the agitation I evoked in the fellow!

It might be fun to know more about these fellow, but you now know all you
need to know, except their names. <ent type='ORG'>Search</ent> and destroy! </p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent> was formed by <ent type='ORG'>the creme</ent> de la creme of Europe's most powerful
aristocrats to perpetuate its iron grip on the peasants, to maintain the status
quo, to keep the rich rich, and the poor masses poor.</p>

<p>J.<ent type='PERSON'>Jayne</ent>s book, "The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown Of the Bicameral
Mind," explains how for thousands of years, the masses have been hypnotized
into not thinking for themselves by <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent> like leaders who use mysticism,
religion, music and propaganda to accomplish this. A person can still do very
hard organized work for these manipulators and actually still not ever think in
a non-bicameral or enlightened state of mind. This has allowed the world's
sadistic, oppressive leaders to screw us for 1000's of years.</p>

<p>It appears that the illuminati had penetrated U.S. government from the
beginning. The <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent> was formed in 1776 by a lawyer in <ent type='GPE'>Bavaria</ent>.
These esquires snaked their way into the womb of <ent type='NORP'>Amerika</ent> from the <ent type='ORG'>getgo</ent>!
I find it revolting and an infinite slap in the face to see lawyers' own symbol
of economic repression on the very money we get shafted for by these leach
lawyers daily. </p>

<p>(In 1776 The European Economic Community (the aristocracy) worried quite
a bit when WE told <ent type='GPE'>England</ent> to get the Hell outta here, so naturally they
regrouped and formed the <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent> to deal with US and prevent future colonies
from being so eager to toss the king's tea taxes overboard!)</p>

<p>ACCORDING TO THE RISE AND POWER OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANKERS CHART:</p>

<p>Beginning in 1795, five of the Rothschild's sons were sent to five different
European countries, were the <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent>/World Banker scam started to spread
in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, <ent type='GPE'>Vienna</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>England</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>. This put them in the top five
countries, where they soon rose to positions of immense power and influence.
Thus the manipulation of global affairs began!</p>

<p>The 10 commandments of the <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent> are:
1 - <ent type='NORP'>Abolish</ent> land ownership.
2 - Taxation of the people.
3 - <ent type='NORP'>Abolish</ent> all rights of inheritance.
4 - Confiscate lands and properties of all rebels.
5 - Centralize credit - <ent type='ORG'>Create National</ent> banks.
6 - <ent type='ORG'>Control</ent> transportation and communication.
7 - State owned factories.
8 - Equal liability of all to labor.
9 - Distribution of the population.
10 - Free education to all in "public" schools.
(Sounds like <ent type='ORG'>bigbro</ent> ta me, Booboo!)</p>

<p>The chart shows that in 1798 the following 3 things occurred:
1 - <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> warned of the danger of the <ent type='ORG'>Illuminati</ent>.
2 - Jefferson wrote to <ent type='PERSON'>John Adams</ent> stating that he agreed with
him that the international bankers were more powerful and
dangerous than standing armies.
3 - Professor <ent type='PERSON'>John Robinson</ent> exposed it in his book, " PROOFS OF
A CONSPIRACY."</p>

<p>And then in 1836, <ent type='PERSON'>Andrew Jackson</ent> abolished the central bank. If this
measure had not been taken, <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> would have fallen to the
<ent type='ORG'>International</ent> bankers at this time.</p>

<p>NOTE: the last 40 lines were 1% of the data on the chart showing the
Illuminati's links and activities as "<ent type='ORG'>Control</ent>," which appears
to be their new name. Get the damn chart - I don't care what
you think of <ent type='NORP'>Baptists</ent>, these folks are just helping us now!
