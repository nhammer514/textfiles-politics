--<ent type='ORG'>TERMINAL</ent> ABM SYSTEM--
</p>
<p>
Very neat things can be done if one "nests" several <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> shields --
say three or four -- concentrically, one inside the other. In that case even
the nuclear radiation (such as gamma rays) from a defense-suppressive high
altitude nuclear burst can be handled.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose three such concentric shields are placed over a
large vital area. Further, suppose a high altitude nuclear burst is placed
above the outer shield. Gamma radiation almost instantly strikes the plasma
in the outer shell, where it is absorbed, scattered, and re-radiated at a
lower temperature. (That after all is what plasmas do.) Inside the first
shell, the scattered radiation is now in the x-ray and ultra violet region.
Let us track the most lethal component, the x-rays. </p>

<p> The scattered x-rays then strike the second plasma shell, and are
absorbed scattered and re-radiated at a lower temperature. Inside the second
shell the scattered radiation is now in the visible and infrared region, with
a little ultraviolet.
</p>
<p>
This optical radiation in turn strikes the third plasma shell, and is
absorbed scattered and re-radiated at still lower temperature. Inside the
third shell, most of the energy is now in the form of radio frequency (RF)
energy, with a little IR and visible band spectral energy content.
</p>
<p>
At this point, ordinary electromagnetic interference (<ent type='ORG'>EMI</ent>) shielding of
electronic equipment on the ground inside the third shield can take care of
any RF interference resulting from the emergent RF noise. </p>

<p> As can be seen, three shells are sufficient to convert the gamma and
x-ray radiation (and ultraviolet and infrared) mostly to harmless RF energy
before all three shells are penetrated. Thus the tactic of deliberate defense
suppression by a preliminary high altitude nuclear burst can be countered by
multiple <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> shields. </p>

<p> In addition, of course, any ordinary vehicles penetrating all three
shields are exposed to successive violent EMP's and are almost certainly
electrically dudded. The vehicles are also subjected to multiple periods of
intense heating, so combustibles, fuels, explosives, and ablatives are
destroyed. In addition, metal structures may be melted or vaporized. </p>

<p> Think of it this way: anything which hits one of these <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> shields
goes phhht! Just like a bug hitting an electrified bugkiller screen. </p>

<p> For years passing ships have observed and reported such multiple-shield
"light phenomena" over remote regions of the ocean. U.S. intelligence has
routinely not paid any heed to "lights at night" over remote ocean areas, and
so <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> tests in this manner have remained relatively unnoticed by
officialdom... </p>

<p>--<ent type='ORG'>WOODPECKER</ent> BEAMS INTERSECT OVER <ent type='ORG'>NORTH AMERICA</ent>--

In July 1976 the U.S. received very special <ent type='GPE'>Bicentennial</ent> greetings from
the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union. </p>

<p> At that time, communications systems of the world in the 3-30 megaHertz
band suddenly met substantial interference from extremely powerful, chirped
<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> transmitters which were suddenly activated. These transmitters
continue their transmission to this day. </p>

<p> Estimates of the power of these transmitters vary, but figures range as
high as several hundred megawatts, with a nominal figure being 100 megawatts. </p>

<p> These powerful transmitters were properly nicknamed "<ent type='ORG'>Woodpeckers</ent>"
because of the characteristic sound of the chirped signal when received. That
is, the received signal makes a "pecking" sound much like a woodpecker's beak
hitting a block of wood. </p>

<p> Several nations protested, but the powerful signals have continued,
right down to this day. The only <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> response was to add a "spread
spectrum" capability, so that the transmitter would not dwell too long on one
specific frequency, but shifted periodically to other frequencies. </p>

<p> These transmitters have apparently never been precisely located by U.S.
intelligence, but their beams carry much of the characteristics of an over-the-horizon (<ent type='ORG'>OTH</ent>) radar. They have been dubbed <ent type='ORG'>OTH</ent> radars by U.S.
intelligence, and can without question perform that mission, in addition to
some very interesting missions that U.S. intelligence does not assess. </p>

<p> "<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Military Power</ent>", Department of Defense, 1985, p.45 shows the
direct intersection over <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States of the <ent type='ORG'>Woodpecker</ent> radar beams used
in an <ent type='ORG'>OTH</ent> role. In addition, shown is an additional "scanner" beam which can
be scanned across the intersection "grid" over the U.S., formed by waveform
interference of two main <ent type='ORG'>Woodpecker</ent> beams. </p>

<p> First, they can be used in a conventional <ent type='ORG'>OTH</ent> radar mode, since their
beams follow the earth-ionosphere waveguide and curve around the earth. In
this mode they can detect missiles at launch and thereafter, and strategic
bombers at launch and thereafter. </p>

<p> These scalar interference grid weapons can be used to biologically
attack entire populations in a targeted area. This aspect is not covered in
this briefing. Suffice it to say that phase locked ELF modulation signals of
10 Hz and less are often detected on multiple woodpecker frequencies
simultaneously. In a target area, this modulation -- is sufficiently stronger
than the <ent type='PERSON'>Schumann</ent> resonance of the earth's magnetic field -- will entrain a
percentage of the brains into "forced entrainment". In that case, these human
brains are "synchronized" to the <ent type='ORG'>Woodpecker</ent> signals so that multiple coherent
frequencies are phase-locked into them. That is, multiple coherent EM
channels directly into these entrained brains now exist. At that point,
Fourier expansions may now be used to attack specific portions of the brain
geometrically. </p>

<p> In addition, scalar EM disease patterns can be modulated upon the
carriers, again with fourier expansions. Specific biological effects can be
induced in the entrained populations at will, limited only by the state of
the art of the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> technology used to attack them. Possible effects
include instantaneous death, heart seizure, severe emotional disruption, loss
of control of internal functions, diseases, disabling of the immune system,
and even implantation of thoughts, emotions, and ideas which are interpreted
by the subjects as their own. </p>

<p> While further discussion of this area is beyond the scope of my
knowledge, the biological aspects of the <ent type='ORG'>Woodpecker</ent> transmitters are
horrible. It suffices to say that, in thousands of experiments, <ent type='PERSON'>Kaznacheyev</ent>
demonstrated that almost any kind of cellular death and disease pattern
could be electromagnetically transmitted. <ent type='PERSON'>Kaznacheyev</ent> reported the effect in
te near ultraviolet. Experimenters at <ent type='ORG'>the University</ent> of Marburg in West
Germany duplicated the experiments in the infrared.</p>

<p> The bottom line is that photons themselves can carry death and disease
patterns between cells. <ent type='ORG'>Scalar</ent> EM technology allows synthesis of the actual
potential pattern (which after all represents total control of charge and
charge distribution, hence biochemistry in the cell) of a particular
disease or death mechanism. Symptoms (and cellular death from them!) of
nuclear radiation, chemical poisoning, bacterial infection, and other
mechanisms were induced by the <ent type='PERSON'>Kaznacheyev</ent> experiments.</p>

<p> Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Popp</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>West Germany</ent> has published an analysis of the virtual
photon master control system of the cells. Since scalar EM represents the
deliberate ordering of virtual particle flux into deterministic patterns,
the master control system can readily be entered with scalar techniques to
induce disease and disorder at will...
