<p><ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>: The Unauthorized Biography</p>

<p>by <ent type='PERSON'>Webster Griffin Tarpley</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Anton</ent> Chaitkin</p>

<p>With this issue of <ent type='ORG'>the New Federalist</ent>, Vol. V, No. 39, we begin
to serialize the book, {<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>: The Unauthorized Biography,}
by <ent type='PERSON'>Webster Griffin Tarpley</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Anton</ent> Chaitkin. This book will
soon be published by {<ent type='ORG'>Executive Intelligence Review</ent>}.</p>

<p> At the heart of any effort at biography is the attempt to
discover the essence of the subject as a human personality. The
essential character of the subject is what the biographer must
strive to capture, since this is theindispensable ingredient
that will provide coherence to the entire story whose unity must
be provided by the course of a single human life.</p>

<p> During the preparation of the present work, there was one
historical moment which more than any other delineated the
character of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>. The scene was the <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>
during the final days of the <ent type='EVENT'>Watergate</ent> debacle. <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>
officials, including <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>, had spent the morning of that
Monday, August 5, 1974 absorbing the impact of Nixon's notorious
"smoking gun" tape, the recorded conversation between <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> and
his chief of staff, H.R. Haldemann, shortly after the original
<ent type='EVENT'>Watergate</ent> break-in, which could now no longer be withheld from
the public. In that exchange of June 23, 1972, <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> ordered
that the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> stop the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> from further investigating how various
sums of money found their way from <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Minnesota</ent> via <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>
City to the coffers of <ent type='ORG'>the Committee</ent> to Re-Elect thePresident
(CREEP) and thence into the pockets of the "Plumbers" arrested
in the <ent type='ORG'>Democratic Party</ent> headquarters in the <ent type='EVENT'>Watergate</ent>building.
These revelations were widely interpreted as establishing a
{prima facie} case of obstruction of justice against <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent>. That
was fine with <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>, who sincerely wanted his patron and
benefactor <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> to resign. George's great concern was that the
smoking gun tape called attention to a money-laundering mechanism
which he, together with <ent type='PERSON'>Bill Liedtke</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>Pennzoil</ent>, and <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Mosbacher</ent>, had helped to set up at Nixon's request. When <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent>,
in the "smoking gun" tape, talked about "the <ent type='NORP'>Texans</ent>" and
"some <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> people," <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Liedtke</ent>, and <ent type='PERSON'>Mosbacher</ent> were among
the most prominent of those referred to. The threat to George's
political ambitions was great.</p>

<p> The <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> that morning was gripped by panic. <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent>
would be gonebeforethe end of the week. In the midst of the
furor, <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>ional liaison <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Timmons</ent></ent> wanted
to know if everyone who needed to be informed had been briefed
about the smoking gun transcript. In a roomful of officials,
some of whom were already sipping <ent type='NORP'>Scotch</ent> to steady their nerves,
<ent type='PERSON'>Timmons</ent> asked <ent type='PERSON'>Dean</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Burch</ent>,</p>

<p>"<ent type='PERSON'>Dean</ent>, does <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> know about the transcript yet?"
"Yes," responded <ent type='PERSON'>Burch</ent>.
"Well, what did he do?" inquired <ent type='PERSON'>Timmons</ent>.
"He broke out into assholes and shit himself to death,"
replied <ent type='PERSON'>Burch</ent>.
Inthis exchange, which is recordedin <ent type='PERSON'>Woodward</ent> and
Bernstein's {The Final Days,} we grasp the essential <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>,
in a crisis, and for all seasons.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>

<p> The thesis of this book is simple: if <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> were to be
re-elected in November 1992 for a second term as the President of
<ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States, this country and the rest of the world would
face a catastrophe of gigantic proportions.</p>

<p> The necessity of writing this book became overwhelming in the
minds of the authors in the wake of the ghastly slaughter of the
<ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> war of January-February 1991. That war was an act of savage
and premeditated genocide on the part of <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, undertaken in
connivance with a clique in <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> which has, in its historical
continuity, represented boththe worst enemy of the long-term
interests of the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> people, and the most implacable
adversary of the progress of the human species.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Theauthors</ent> observed <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> as the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> crisis and the
war unfolded, and had no doubt that his enraged publicoutbursts
constituted real psychotic episodes, indicative of a deranged
mental state that was full of ominous portent for humanity. The
authors were also horrified by the degree to which their fellow
citizens willfully ignored the shocking reality of these public
fits. A majority of the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> people proved more than willing
to lend its support to a despicable enterprise of killing.</p>

<p> By their role-call votes of January 12, 1991, the Senate and
the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> ofRepresentatives authorized Bush's planned war
measures to restore the Emir of <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>, who owns and holds
chattel slaves. That vote was a crime against God's justice.</p>

<p> This book is part of an attempt to help the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> people to
survive this terrible crime, both for the sake of the world and
for their ownsake. It is intended as a contribution to a
process of education that might help to save the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> people
from the awesome destruction of a second <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> presidency. It is
further intended as a warning to all citizens that if they fail
to deny <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> a second term, they will deserve what they get after
1993.</p>

<p> As this book goes to press, public awareness of the long-term
depression of the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> economy is rapidly growing. If <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
were re-elected, he would view himself as beyond the reach of the
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> electorate; with the federal deficit rising over a
billion dollars a day, a second <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> administration would dictate
such crushing austerity as to bring the country to thebrink of
civil war. Some examples of this point are described in the last
chapter of this book.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Ourgoal</ent> has been to assemble as much of the truth about <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
as possible within thetime constraints imposed bythe 1992
election. Time and resources have not permitted us meticulous
attention to certain matters of detail; we can say, nevertheless,
that both our commitment to the truth and our final product are
betterthan anythinganyoneelse has been able to muster,
including news organizationsand intelligence agencies with
capabilities that far surpass our own.</p>

<p> Why do we fight the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> power cartel with a mere book? We
have no illusions of easy success, but we were encouraged in our
work by the hope that a biography might stimulate opposition to
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and his policies.It will certainly pose a new set of
problems for those seeking to get <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> re-elected. For although
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> is now what journalists call a world leader, no accurate
account of his actual career exists in the public domain.</p>

<p> Thevolumewhich we submit to the court of world public
opinion is, to the best of our knowledge, the first book-length,
unauthorized biography of<ent type='PERSON'>George</ent><ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>. It is the first
approximation of the truth about his life. This is the first
biography worthy of the name, a fact that says a great deal about
the sinister and obsessive secrecy of this personage. None of
the other biographies (including Bush's campaign autobiography)
can be takenseriously; each of these books is a pastiche of
lies, distortions and banalities that run the gamut from campaign
panegyric, to the <ent type='PERSON'>Goebbels</ent> Big Lie, to fake but edifying stories
for credulous children. Almost without exception, the available
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> literature is worthless as a portrait of the subject.</p>

<p> Bush's family pedigree establishes him as a networkasset of
<ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>, one of the most powerful political
forces in <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States during much of the twentieth century,
and for many years the largest private bank inthe world. It
suffices in this context to think of <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> negotiating
during<ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent> IIin the name of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States with
<ent type='ORG'>Churchill</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Stalin</ent>, or of the role of <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>
partner <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent></ent> in guiding <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> F. Kennedy's choice of his
cabinet, to begin to see the implications of Senator <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent>
Bush's post as managing partner of this bank. <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> networks pervade government and the mass media. Again
and again in the course of the following pages wewill see
stories embarrassing to <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> refused publication,
documents embarrassing to <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> suspiciously disappear, and
witnesses inculpatoryto <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> be overtaken by mysterious and
conveniently timed deaths. The few relevant facts which have
found their way into the public domain have necessarily been
filtered by this gigantic apparatus. This <ent type='GPE'>problemhas</ent> been
compounded by thecorruption and servility of authors,
journalists, news executives and publishers who have functioned
more and more as kept advocates for a governmental regime of
which <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> has been a prominent part for a quarter-century.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>Red Studebaker</ent> Myth</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> wants key aspects of his life to remain covert.
At the same time, he senses thathis need for coverup is a
vulnerability.The need to protect this weak flank accounts for
the steady stream of fake biographical material concerning
<ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>, as well as the spin given to many studies that may never
mention <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>directly. Over the past several months, we have
seen a new book about <ent type='EVENT'>Watergate</ent> that pretends to tell the public
something newby fingering Al Haig as <ent type='PERSON'>Deep Throat</ent>, but ignoring
the central role of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> and his business partners in the
<ent type='EVENT'>Watergate</ent> affair. We have a new book by Lt. Col. <ent type='PERSON'>Oliver</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent>
which alleges that Reagan knew everything about the <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>-Contra
affair, but that <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> was not part of North's chain of
command. The latter point merely paraphrasesBush'sown lame
excusethat he was "out of the loop" during all those illegal
transactions. During the hearings on the nomination of <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent>
Gates to become director of <ent type='ORG'>Central Intelligence</ent>, nobody had
anything new to add about the role of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>, the boss of
<ent type='ORG'>the National Security Council</ent>'s Special Situation Group crisis
staff that was a command center for the whole affair. These
charades are <ent type='ORG'>peddledto</ent> a very credulous public by operatives
whose task goes beyond mere damage control to mind control--the
"MK" in the government's MK-Ultra operation.</p>

<p> Part of the free ride enjoyed by <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> during the 1988
elections is reflected in the fact that at no point in the
campaign was there any serious effort <ent type='PERSON'>byany</ent> of the news
organizations to provide the public with an accurate and complete
account of his political career. At least two biographies of
<ent type='PERSON'>Dukakis</ent> appeared which, although hardly critical,were not
uniformly laudatory either. But in the case of <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, all the
public could turn to was Bush's old 1980 campaign biography and a
newer campaign autobiography, both of them a tissue of lies.</p>

<p> Early in the course of our research for the present volume it
became apparent that all books and most longerarticles dealing
with the life of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> had been generated from a single
print-out of thoroughly approved "facts" about <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and his
family. We learned that during 1979-80, <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> aide <ent type='PERSON'>Pete Roussel</ent>
attempted to recruit biographers to prepare a life of <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> based
on a collection of press releases, news summaries, and similar
pre-digested material. Most biographical writing about <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
consists merely of the points from this printout, strung out
chronologically and made into anarrative through the
interpretation of comments, anecdotes, embellishments, or special
stylistic devices.</p>

<p> Thecanonical <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>-approved printout is readily identified.
One dead giveaway is the inevitability with which the hacks out
to cover up the substance of Bush's life refer to a 1947 red
<ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent> which <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> allegedly drove into <ent type='GPE'>Odessa</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>
in 1948. This is the sort of detail which has been introduced
into Bush's real life in a deliberate and deceptive attempt to
humanize his image.It has been our experience that any text
that features a reference to Bush's red <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent> has probably
been derived from Bush's list of approved facts, and is therefore
practically worthless for serious research into Bush's life. We
therefore assign such texts to the "red <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent> school" of
coverup and falsification.</p>

<p> Some examples? This is from Bush's campaign autobiography,
{Looking Forward,} ghost-written by his aide <ent type='PERSON'>Vic Gold</ent>:"Heading
into <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> in my <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent>, all I knewabout the state's
landscape was what I'd seen from the cockpit of a <ent type='ORG'>Vultee Vibrator</ent>
during my training days in the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent>."s1
Here is the same moment as recaptured by Bush's crony Fitzhugh
Green, a friend of the <ent type='NORP'>Malthusian</ent> financier <ent type='PERSON'>Russell Train</ent>, in his
{<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>: An Intimate Portrait,} published after <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> had won
the presidency: "He (<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>) gassed up his1948 <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent>,
arranged for his wife and son to follow, and headed for <ent type='GPE'>Odessa</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>."s2</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Harry Hurt III</ent> wrote the followinglines in a 1983 <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>
magazine article that was even decorated with a drawing of what
apparently is supposed to be a <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent>, but whichdoes not
look like a <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent> of that vintage at all: "When <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Herbert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> drove his battered red <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent> into <ent type='GPE'>Odessa</ent>
in the summer of 1948, the town's population, though constantly
increasing with newly-arrived oil field hands, was still under
30000."s3</p>

<p> We see that <ent type='PERSON'>Harry Hurt</ent> has more imagination than many <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
biographers, and <ent type='PERSON'>hisarticle</ent> does provide a few useful facts.
More degraded is the version offered by <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Ben Kramer</ent>, whose
biography of <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> is expected to be published during 1992. <ent type='PERSON'>Cramer</ent>
was given the unenviable task of breathing life once more into
the same tired old printout. But the very fact that the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
team feels that it requires another biography indicates that it
still feels that it has a potential vulnerability here. <ent type='PERSON'>Cramer</ent>
has attempted to solve his problem byrecasting thesame old
garbage into a frenetic and hyperkinetic, we would almost say
{hyperthyroid} style. The following is from an excerpt of this
forthcoming book that was published in {Esquire} in June 1991:
"In June, after <ent type='ORG'>the College World Series</ent> and graduation day in
<ent type='GPE'>New Haven</ent>, Poppy packed up his new red <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent> (a graduation
gift from Pres), and started driving south."s4</p>

<p> Was that <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent>shiny and new, or old andbattered?
Perhaps the printout is not specific on this point; in any case,
as we see, our authorities diverge.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Joe Hyams</ent>'s 1991 romance of <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> at war, the {Flight of the
Avenger,}s5 does notinclude the obligatory "red <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent>"
reference, but this is more than compensated for bythe most
elaborate fawning over other details of our hero's war service.
The publication of {Flight of the Avenger,} which concentrates on
an heroic retelling of Bush's war record,and ignores all
evidence that might tend to puncture this myth, was timed to
coincide with Bush's war with <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>. This is a vile tract written
with the open assistance of <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Barbara</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, and the White
<ent type='ORG'>House</ent> staff. {Flight of the Avenger} recallsthe practice of
totalitarian states according to which a war waged by the regime
should be accompanied by propaganda which depicts the regime's
strong man ina martial posture. In any case, this book deals
with Bush's life up to the end of <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent> II; we never reach
<ent type='GPE'>Odessa</ent>.</p>

<p> Only one of the full-length accounts produced by the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
propaganda machine neglects the red <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent> story. This is
<ent type='PERSON'>Nicholas King</ent>'s {<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>: A Biography,} the first book-length
version of Bush's life, produced as a result of <ent type='PERSON'>Pete Roussel</ent>'s
efforts for the 1980 campaign. <ent type='PERSON'>Nicholas King</ent> had served as
Bush'sspokesman when he was U.S.Ambassador to <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent>
Nations. King admits in his preface that he can be impugned for
writing a work of the most transparent apologetics: "In
retrospect," he says , "this book may seem open to the charge
of puffery, for the view of its subject is favorable all
around."s6 Indeed.</p>

<p> Books about <ent type='PERSON'>Barbara</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> slavishly rehearse the same details
from the sameprintout. Here is the relevant excerpt from the
warmly admiring {Simply <ent type='PERSON'>Barbara</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>: A Portrait ofAmerica's
CandidFirst Lady,} writtenby <ent type='PERSON'>Donnie Radcliffe</ent> and published
after Bush's 1988 election victory: "With $3000 left over after
he graduated in June, 1948, he headed for <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> in the1947 red
<ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent> his father had given him for graduation after George's
car died on the highway."s7</p>

<p> Even foreign journalists attempting to inform their publics
about conditions in <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States have fallen victim to the
same old <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>printout. The <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> author and reporter Rainer
<ent type='ORG'>Bonhorst</ent>, the former <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> correspondent of the
{<ent type='ORG'>Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</ent>,} in his 1988 book {<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>:
The New Man in the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>,} named a chapter of this <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
political biography "To <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> in the <ent type='ORG'>Red Studebaker</ent>." <ent type='ORG'>Bonhorst</ent>
writesas follows: "Then there was still the matter of the red
<ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent>. It plays--rightafter the world wareffort--a
central role in thelife history of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>. It is the
history of his rebellion. The step which made a careless <ent type='NORP'>Texan</ent>
out of a stiff New<ent type='GPE'>England</ent>er, a self-made man out <ent type='ORG'>ofa</ent>
patrician's son, born into wealth.... Thus, <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Barbara</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, 24 and23 years old, he having just finished with his
studies, she having prematurely withdrawn from her university and
become a mother a few months earlier, packed their baby and their
suitcases and loaded them into their glaring red <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent>
coupe.</p>

<p> "Asupermodern, smart car, certainly somewhat loud for the
<ent type='LOC'>New England</ent> taste,' the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>es later recalled. But finally it
departed towards <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>."s8
We see that <ent type='ORG'>Bonhorst</ent> isacutely awareof the symbolic
importance assumed by the red <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent> in these hagiographic
accounts of Bush's life.</p>

<p> What is finally the truth of the matter? There is good reason
to believe that <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> did not first come to <ent type='GPE'>Odessa</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>,
in a red <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent>. One knowledgeable source is the well-known
<ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> oil man and <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> campaign contributor <ent type='PERSON'>Oscar Wyatt</ent> of
<ent type='GPE'>Houston</ent>. In arecentletterto the {<ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> Monthly,} <ent type='PERSON'>Wyatt</ent>
specifies that "when people speak of Mr. Bush's humble
beginnings in the oil industry, it should be noted that he rode
down to <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> on Dresser's private aircraft. He was accompanied
by his father, who at that time was one of the directors of
<ent type='PERSON'>Dresser</ent> Industries.... I hate it when people make statements
about Mr. Bush's humble beginnings in the oil industry. It just
didn'thappenthat way," writes Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Wyatt</ent>.s9 <ent type='PERSON'>Dresser</ent> was a
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> company, and <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> got his start working for one of its
subsidiaries.One history of <ent type='PERSON'>Dresser</ent> Industries contains a
photograph of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> with his parents, wife, and infant son
"in front of a <ent type='PERSON'>Dresser</ent> company airplane in West <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>."s1s0 Can
this be a photo of Bush's arrival in <ent type='GPE'>Odessa</ent> during the summer of
1948? In <ent type='ORG'>anycase</ent>, this most cherished myth ofthe <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
biographers is very much open to doubt.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>The Roman</ent> Propaganda Machine</p>

<p> Fawning biographies of bloodthirsty tyrants are nothing new in
world literature. The red <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent> school goes back a long
way; these writers of today can be usefullycompared witha
certain Gaius <ent type='PERSON'>Velleius Paterculus</ent>, who lived in <ent type='GPE'>the Roman Empire</ent>
under the emperors <ent type='PERSON'>Augustus</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent>, and who was thus an
approximate contemporary of Jesus Christ. <ent type='PERSON'>Velleius Paterculus</ent> was
an historian and biographer who is known today, if at all, for
his biographical notes on the Emperor <ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent>, which are
contained within Paterculus's history of <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent>.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Paterculus</ent>,writing under<ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent>, gave a very favorable
treatment of <ent type='PERSON'>Julius Caesar</ent>, and became fulsome when he came to
write of <ent type='PERSON'>Augustus</ent>. But the worst excesses of flattery came in
<ent type='PERSON'>Velleius Paterculus</ent>'s treatment of <ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent> himself. Here is
part of what he writes about that tyrannical ruler:</p>

<p> "Of the transactions of the last sixteen years, which have
passed in the view, and are fresh in the memory of all, who shall
presume to give a full account? ... credit has been restored to
mercantile affairs, seditionhas been banished from the forum,
corruption from the <ent type='ORG'>Campus Martius</ent>, and discord from the
<ent type='ORG'>senate</ent>-house; justice, equity and industry, which had long lain
buried in neglect, have been revived in the state; authority has
been given to the magistrates, majesty to the <ent type='ORG'>senate</ent>, and
solemnity to the courts of justice; the bloody riots in the
theatre have been suppressed, and all men have had either a
desire excited in them, or a necessity imposed on them, of acting
with integrity. Virtuous actsare honored, wicked deeds are
punished. The humble respects the powerful, without dreading
him; the powerful takes precedenceof the humble without
condemning him. When were provisions more moderate in price?
When were the blessings of peace more abundant? <ent type='GPE'>Augustan</ent> peace,
diffused overall the regions of the east and the west, and all
that lies between the south and the north, preserves every corner
of the world free from all dread of predatory molestation.
Fortuitous losses, not only of individuals, but of cities, the
munificence of the prince is ready to relieve. The cities of
<ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent> have been repaired; the provinces have been secured from the
oppression of their governors. Honor promptly rewards the
deserving, and the punishment of the guilty, ifslow, is
certain. Interest gives place to justice, solicitation to
merit.For the best of princes teaches his countrymen to act
rightly by his own practice; and while he is the greatest in
power, he is still greater in example.</p>

<p> "Having exhibited a general view of the administration of
<ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent> Caesar, let us now enumerate a few particulars
respecting it.... How formidable a war, excited by the Gallic
chief <ent type='NORP'>Sacrovir</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Julius Florius</ent>, did he suppress, and with such
amazing expedition and energy, that the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> people learned that
they were conquerors, before they knew that they were at war, and
the news of the victory outstripped the news of the danger! The
<ent type='NORP'>African</ent> war too, perilous as it was, and daily increasing in
strength, was quickly terminatedunder his auspices and
direction...."s1s1</p>

<p> All of this was written in praise of the regime that crucified
Jesus Christ, and one of the worst genocidal tyrannies in the
history of the world.<ent type='PERSON'>Paterculus</ent>, we must sadly conclude, was a
sycophant of the <ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent> administration. Some of his themes are
close parallels to the propaganda of today's <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> machine.</p>

<p> In addition to feeding the personality cult of<ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent>,
<ent type='PERSON'>Paterculus</ent> also lavished praise on <ent type='PERSON'>Lucius Aelius Sejanus</ent>, the
Prefect of <ent type='ORG'>the Praetorian Guard</ent> and for manyyears Tiberius's
number one favorite, second in command, and likely successor. In
many respects<ent type='NORP'>Sejanus</ent> was not unlike <ent type='PERSON'>James Baker III</ent> under the
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> regime. While <ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent> spent all of his time inseclusion
on his island of Capri near <ent type='GPE'>Naples</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>Sejanus</ent> assumed day to day
control of the vastempireand its 100 millionsubjects.
<ent type='PERSON'>Paterculus</ent> wrote of <ent type='ORG'>Sejanusthat</ent> he was "a most excellent
coadjutor in all the toils of government ... aman of pleasing
gravity, and of unaffected cheerfulness ... assuming nothing to
himself." That was the voice of the red <ent type='ORG'>Studebaker</ent> school in
about 30 A.D. <ent type='PERSON'>Paterculus</ent> should have limited his fawning to
<ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent> himself; somewhat later, the emperor, suspecting a coup
plot, condemned <ent type='NORP'>Sejanus</ent> andhad him <ent type='ORG'>tornlimb</ent> from limb in
gruesome retribution.</p>

<p> But why bring up <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent>? Some readers may be scandalized by the
things that truth obliges us to record about a sittingpresident
of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States. Are we not disrespectful to this high
office? No. One of the reasons for glancing back at Imperial
<ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> is to remind ourselves that in times of moral and cultural
degradation like our own, rulers of great evil haveinflicted
incalculable <ent type='PERSON'>sufferingon</ent> humanity.In our modern time of war
and depression, this is once again the case.If <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> was
possible then, who could claim that the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> of <ent type='EVENT'>the New World</ent>
Order should be exempt? Let us therefore tarry for a moment with
these old <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent>s, because they can show us much about ourselves.</p>

<p> In order to find <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> writers who tell us anything reliable
about the first dozen emperors, we must wait until the infamous
Julio-Claudian dynastyof <ent type='PERSON'>Julius Caesar</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Augustus</ent>,<ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent>,
<ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent>, Claudius, <ent type='PERSON'>Nero</ent>, and the rest had entirely passed from
the scene, to be supplanted by new ruling houses. <ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent>
reigned from 14 to 37 A.D.; <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent>, his designated successor,
from 37 to 41 A.D.; and <ent type='PERSON'>Nero</ent> from 54 to 68 A.D. But the first
accurate account of the crimes of some of these emperors comes
from <ent type='ORG'>Publius Cornelius Tacitus</ent> in about 115-17 A.D., late in the
reign of the emperor <ent type='PERSON'>Trajan</ent>. It was feasible for <ent type='ORG'>Tacitus</ent> to write
and publish a more realistic account of the Julio-Claudian
emperors because oneof the constant themes of Trajan's
propaganda was to glorify himself as an enlightened emperor
through comparison with the earlier series of bloody tyrants.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Tacitus</ent> manages to convey how the destructivenessof these
emperors in their personal lives correlated with their mass
executions and their genocidal economic policies. <ent type='ORG'>Tacitus</ent> was
familiar withthe machinery of <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> Imperial power: he was of
senatorial rank, served as consul in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> in 97 A.D., and was
the governor of theimportant province of western <ent type='GPE'>Anatolia</ent>
(today's <ent type='GPE'>Turkey</ent>) which the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent>s referred <ent type='ORG'>tosimplyas</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>.
<ent type='ORG'>Tacitus</ent> writes of <ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent>: "... his criminal lusts shamed him.
Their uncontrollable activity was worthy of anoriental tyrant.
Free-born children were his victims. He was fascinated by
beauty, youthful innocence, and aristocratic birth. New names
for types of perversions were invented. Slaves were charged to
locate and procure his requirements.... It was like the sack of
a captured city."</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent> was ableto dominate the legislative branch of his
government, the <ent type='ORG'>senate</ent>, by subversion and terror: "It was,
indeed, a horrible feature of this period that leading senators
became informers evenon trivial matters--some openly, many
secretly. Friends and relatives were as suspect as strangers,
old stories as damaging as new. Inthe Main Square, ata
dinner-party, a remark on any subject might mean prosecution.
Everyone competed forpriority in marking down the victim.
Sometimes this was self-defense, but mostly it was a sort of
contagion, like an epidemic.... I realize that many writers omit
numerous trials and condemnations, bored by repetition or afraid
that catalogues they themselves have found over-long and dismal
may equally depress their readers.But numerous unrecorded
incidents, which have come to my attention, ought to be known.</p>

<p> "... Even women were in danger.They could not be charged
with aiming at <ent type='ORG'>supreme power</ent>. So they were charged with weeping:
one old lady was executed for lamenting her son's death. The
<ent type='ORG'>senate</ent> decidedthis case.... In the same year the high price of
corn nearly caused riots....</p>

<p> "<ent type='ORG'>Frenzied</ent> with bloodshed, (<ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent>) now ordered the
execution of all those arrested for complicity with <ent type='NORP'>Sejanus</ent>. It
was a massacre. Without discrimination of sex or age, eminence
or obscurity, therethey lay, strewn about--or in heaps.
Relatives and friends were forbidden to stand by or lament them,
or even gaze for long. Guards surrounded them, spying on their
sorrow, and escorted the rotting bodies until, dragged to the
<ent type='PERSON'>Tiber</ent>,they floated away or grounded--with none to cremate or
touch them. Terror had paralyzed human sympathy. The rising
surge of brutality drove compassion away."s1s2</p>

<p> This is the same<ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent> administration so extravagantly
praised by <ent type='PERSON'>Velleius Paterculus</ent>.
Because of lacunae in the manuscripts of Tacitus's work that
have come down to us, much of what we know of the rule of
<ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> (Gaius Caesar, in power from 37 to 41 A.D.) derives from
{The Lives of the Twelve Caesars,} a book by Gaius<ent type='PERSON'>Suetonius</ent>
Tranquillus. The character and administration of <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> present
some striking parallels with the subject of the present book.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Asa</ent> stoic, <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> was a great admirer of his own
"immovable rigor." His motto was "Remember that Ihave the
right to do anything to anybody." He made no secret of his
bloodthirsty vindictiveness. <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> was a fan of the green
team in the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> arena, and when the crowd <ent type='ORG'>applaudeda</ent>
charioteer who wore a different color, <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> criedout, "I
wish the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> people had but a single neck." At one of his
state dinners<ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> burst into a fit of uncontrollable
laughter, andwhen a consul askedhim what was so funny, he
replied that it was the thought that as emperor <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> had the
power to have the throats of the top officials cut at any time he
chose. <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> carried this same attitude into his personal
life: whenever he kissed or caressed the neck of his wife or one
of his mistresses, he liked to remark: "Off comes this beautiful
head whenever I give the word."</p>

<p> Above all, <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> was vindictive. After his death, two
notebooks were found among his personal papers, one labelled
"The Sword"and the other labelled "The Dagger." These were
lists of the persons he had proscribed and liquidated,and were
the forerunners of the enemies lists and discrediting committee
of today. <ent type='PERSON'>Suetonius</ent> frankly calls <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> "a monster," and
speculates on thepyschologicalrootsof his criminal
disposition: "I think I may attributeto mental weakness the
existence of two exactly opposite faults in the same person,
extreme assurance and, on theotherhand,excessive
timorousness." <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> was"full of threats" against "the
barbarians," but at the same time prone to precipitous retreats
and flights of panic. <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> worked on his "body language"
by "practicing all kinds of terrible and fearsome expressions
before a mirror."</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> built an extension of his palace to connect with the
Temple of Castor and Pollux, and often went there to exhibit
himself as an object of public worship, delighting in being
hailed as "<ent type='ORG'>Jupiter Latiaris</ent>" by the populace. Later <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent>
would officially opentemples in his own name. <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> was
brutal in his intimidation of the <ent type='ORG'>senate</ent>, whose members he
subjected to open humiliations and covert attacks; many senators
were "secretly put to death." "He often inveighed against all
the Senators alike.... He treated the other orders with like
insolence and cruelty." <ent type='PERSON'>Suetonius</ent> recites whole catalogues of
"special instances of his innate brutality" toward persons of
all walks of life. He enjoyed inflicting torture, and revelled
in liquidating political opponents or those who had insulted or
snubbed him in some way. He had a taste for capital executions
as theperfect backdrop for parties and banquets. <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> also
did everything he could to denigrate the memory of the great men
of past epochs, so that their fame could not eclipse his own:
"He assailed mankind of almost every epoch with no less envy and
malice than insolence and cruelty. He threw down the statues of
famous men" and tried to destroy all the texts of Homer.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> "respected neither his own chastity nor that of any
one else." He was reckless in his extravagance, and soon emptied
out the imperial treasury of all the funds that old <ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent> had
squirreled away there. After that, <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> tried to replenish
his coffers through a system of spies, false accusations,
property seizures, and public auctions. He also "levied new and
unheard-of taxes," to the point that "no class of commodities
was exempt from some kind of tax or other." <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> taxed all
foodstuffs, took a fortiethof the award in any lawsuit, an
eighth of the daily wages of the porters, and demandedthat the
prostitutes pay him a daily fee equal to the average price
charged to each individual customer. (It is rumored that this
part of Caligula's career is under study by those planning <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>
Bush's second term.) <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> also opened a brothel in his palace
as anadditional source of income, which may prefigure today's
<ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> staff. Among Caligula's moresingular hobbies
<ent type='PERSON'>Suetonius</ent> includes his love of rolling and wallowing in piles of
gold coins.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> kept his wife, <ent type='GPE'>Caesonia</ent> (describedby <ent type='PERSON'>Suetonius</ent> as
"neither beautiful nor young") with him until the very end.
But his greatest devotion was to his horse, whom he made consul
of the<ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> state. Ultimately <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> fell victim to a
conspiracy of <ent type='ORG'>the Praetorian Guard</ent>, led by the tribune Gaius
Chaerea, a man whom<ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> had taken special delight in
humiliating.s1s3</p>

<p> The authors of the present study are convinced that these
references tothe depravityof the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> emperors, and to the
records of that depravity provided by such authors as <ent type='ORG'>Tacitus</ent> and
<ent type='PERSON'>Suetonius</ent>, are directly germane to our present task offollowing
the career of a member of the senatorial class of the
Anglo-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> elite through the various stages of hisformation
and ultimate ascent to imperial power. <ent type='ORG'>The Roman</ent> Imperial model
is germane because the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> rulingelite of today is far
closerto the world of <ent type='PERSON'>Tiberius</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> than it is to the
world of the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Revolution or the Constitutional Convention
of 1789. The leitmotif of modern <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> presidential politics
is unquestionably an imperial theme, most blatantly expressed by
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> in his slogan for 1990, "The NewWorld Order," and for
1991, the "pax universalis." The central project of the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
presidency isthe creation and consolidation of a single,
universal Anglo-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> (orAnglo-<ent type='NORP'>Saxon</ent>) empire very directly
modelled on the various phases of <ent type='GPE'>the Roman Empire</ent>.</p>

<p>The Olympian Delusion</p>

<p> There is one other aspect of the biographical-historical
methodof the <ent type='ORG'>Graeco</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> world which we have sought to borrow.
Ever since Thucydides composed hismonumental work on the
PeloponnesianWar, those who have sought to imitate his
style--with the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> historian <ent type='PERSON'>Titus Livius</ent> prominent among
them--have employed the device of attributing long speeches to
historical personages, even when it appears very unlikely that
such lengthy orations could have been made by the protagonists at
the time. This has nothing to do with the synthetic dialogue of
current <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> political writing, which attempts to present
historical events asa series of trivial and banal soap-opera
exchanges, which carry on for such interminable lengths as to
suggest that the authors are getting paid by the word. Our idea
of <ent type='ORG'>fidelity</ent> to the classical style has simply been to let <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> speak for himself wherever possible, through direct
quotation. We are convinced that by letting <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> express himself
directly in this way, we afford the reader a more faithful--and
damning--account of Bush's actions.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> might agreethat "history is biography,"
although we suspect that he would not agree with any of our other
conclusions. There may be a few peculiarities of the present
work as biography that are worthy of explanation at the outset.</p>

<p> One of our basic theses is that <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> is, and considers
himself to be, an oligarch. The notion of oligarchy includes
first of all the idea of a patrician and wealthy family capable
of introducing its offspring into such elite institutions as
<ent type='GPE'>Andover</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent>,and <ent type='ORG'>Skull</ent> and Bones. Oligarchy also subsumes the
self-conception of the oligarch as belonging to a special,
exalted breed of mankind, one that is superior to the common run
of mankind as a matter of hereditary genetic superiority. This
mentality generallygoes togetherwith a fascination for
eugenics, race science and just plain racism as a means of
building a case that one's own family tree and racial stock are
indeed superior. These notions of "breeding" are a constant in
the history of the titled feudal aristocracy of Europe,
especially <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>, towards inclusion in which an individual like
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> must necessarily strive.At the very least, oligarchs like
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> see themselves as demigods occupying a middle ground between
the immortals above and the {hoi polloi} below. The culmination
of this insane delusion, which <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> has demonstrably long since
attained, is the obsessive belief that the principal families of
the Anglo-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> elite, assembled in their <ent type='ORG'>freemasonic</ent> orders,
by themselves directly constitute an Olympian Pantheon of living
deities who have the capability of abrogating and disregarding
the laws of the universe according to their own irrational
caprice. If we do not take into account this element of fatal
and megalomaniac hubris, the lunatic Anglo-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> policies in
regardto the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> War, international finance, or the AIDS
epidemic must defy all comprehension.</p>

<p> Part of the ethos of oligarchism as practiced by <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>
is theemphasis on one's own family pedigree.This accounts for
the attention we dedicate in the opening chapters of this book to
Bush's family tree, reaching back to the nineteenth century and
beyond. It is impossible to gain insight into Bush's mentality
unless we realize that it is important for him to be considered a
cousin, however distant, of Queen <ent type='PERSON'>Elizabeth</ent> II of the<ent type='ORG'>House</ent> of
Mountbatten-Windsor and for his wife <ent type='PERSON'>Barbara</ent> to be viewed in some
sense a descendant of President <ent type='PERSON'>Franklin Pierce</ent>.</p>

<p>The Family Firm</p>

<p> Forrelated reasons, it is our special duty to illustrate the
role played in the formation of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> as a personality by
his maternal grandfather and uncle, <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Herbert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent> and
<ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Herbert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>, Jr., and by <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> H.W. Bush's father, the
late Senator <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>. In the course of this task, we must
speak at length about the institution to which <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> owes
the most, the Wall Street international investment bank of <ent type='PERSON'>Brown</ent>
Brothers <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>, the political and financial powerhouse
mentioned above. For <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> was
and remains the family firm in the deepest sense. The formidable
power of this bank and its ubiquitous network, wielded by Senator
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> up through the time of his death in 1972, and still
activeon George's behalf down to the present day, is the single
most important key to every step of George'sbusiness, covert
operations, and political career.</p>

<p> In the case of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>, as many who have known him
personally have noted, the <ent type='ORG'>networklooms</ent> much larger than
George's own character and will. The reader will search in vain
for strong principled commitments in <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>'s personality;
the most that will be found is a series of characteristic
obsessions, of which the most durable are race, vanity, personal
ambition, and settling scores with adversaries. What emerges by
contrast is the decisive importance of Bush's network of
connections. His response to the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> crisis of 1991 will be
largely predetermined, not by any great flashes of geopolitical
insight, but rather by his connections to the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> oligarchy,
to <ent type='PERSON'>Kissinger</ent>, to <ent type='NORP'>Israeli</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Zionist</ent> circles, to <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> oilmen in
his fundraising base, to the Saudi <ent type='NORP'>Arabian</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>i royal
houses. If the question is one of finance, then the opinions of
J. Hugh <ent type='PERSON'>Liedtke</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Henry Kravis</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Mosbacher</ent></ent>,T. Boone
Pickens, <ent type='PERSON'>Nicholas Brady</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>James Baker III</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>the City</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>London</ent>
will be decisive. If covert operations and dirty tricks are on
the agenda, then there is a whole stable of <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> old boys with
whom he will consult, and so on down the line. During much of
1989, despite his control over the presidency, <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> appeared as a
weak and passive executive, waiting for his networks to show him
what it was he was supposed to do. When <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> reunification and
the <ent type='ORG'>crumblingof</ent> the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> empire spurred those--primarily
<ent type='NORP'>British</ent>--networks intoaction, <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was suddenly capable of
violent and daring adventures. As his battle for a second term
approaches, <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> may be showing increasing signs of a rage-driven
self-starter capability, especially when it comes to starting new
wars designed to secure his re-election.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>The United</ent> States in Decline</p>

<p> Biography has <ent type='GPE'>itsown</ent> inherent discipline: <ent type='GPE'>Itmust</ent> be
concerned with the life of its protagonist, and cannot stray too
far away. In no way has it been our intention tooffer an
account of <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> history during the lifetime of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>.
The present study neverthelessreflects manyaspects of that
recent <ent type='PERSON'>historyof</ent> U.S. decline. It will be noted that <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> has
succeeded in proportion as the country has failed,and that
Bush's advancement has proceeded {paripassu}with the
degradation of the national stage upon which he has operated and
which he has come to dominate. At various phases in his career,
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> has come into conflict with persons who were intellectually
and morally superior to him. Onesuch was Senator Ralph
Yarborough, and another was Senator <ent type='PERSON'>Frank Church</ent>. Our study will
be found to catalogue the constant decline in the qualities of
Bush's adversaries as human types until the 1980s, by which time
his opponents, as in the case of Al Haig, are no better than <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
himself.</p>

<p> Theexception to this trend is Bush's long-standing personal
vendetta against Lyndon <ent type='PERSON'>LaRouche</ent>, his most consistent and capable
adversary. <ent type='PERSON'>LaRouche</ent> was jailed seven days after Bush's
inauguration in the most infamous political frameup of recent
U.S. history. As our study will document, at critical moments in
Bush's career, LaRouche's political interventions have frustrated
some of Bush's best-laid political plans: A very clear example is
LaRouche's role in defeating Bush's 1980 presidential bid in the
<ent type='GPE'>New Hampshire</ent> primary. Over the intervening years, <ent type='PERSON'>LaRouche</ent> has
become <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>'s "man in the iron mask," the principled
political adversary whom <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> seeks to jail and silence at all
costs.The restoration of justice in this country must include
the freeing of Lyndon <ent type='PERSON'>LaRouche</ent>, LaRouche's political associates,
and all the other political prisoners of the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> regime.</p>

<p> As for the political relevance of our project, we think that
it is very real. During the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> crisis, it would have been
important for the public to know more about Bush's business
dealings withthe <ent type='ORG'>Royal Family</ent> of<ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>. During the 1992
presidential campaign, as Wall Street's recent crop ofjunk-bond
assisted leveraged buyouts line up at the entrance to bankruptcy
court, and state workers all across <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States are
informed that the retirement pensions they had been promised will
never be paid, the relations between <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Henry Kravis</ent>
will surely constitute an explosive political issue. Similarly,
once Bush's <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Kissinger</ent>ian pedigree is recognized, the
methods he is likely to pursue in regard to situations such as
the planned <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent>ian-style overthrow of the <ent type='PERSON'>Castro</ent> regime in
<ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>, or theprovocation of a splendid little nuclear war
involving <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Korea</ent>, or of a new Indo-Pakistani war, will
hardly be mysterious.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Theauthors</ent> have been at some pains to makethis work
intelligible to readers around the world. We offer this book to
those who share our aversion to the imperialist-colonialist New
World Order, and our profound horror at the concept <ent type='ORG'>ofa</ent> return
to a single, worldwide <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> Empire as suggested by Bush's "pax
universalis" slogan. This work is tangible evidence that there
is anopposition to <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> inside <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States, and that the
new <ent type='PERSON'>Caligula</ent> is very vulnerable indeed on the level of the
exposure of his own misdeeds.</p>

<p> It will be argued that this book should have been published
before the 1988 election, when a <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> presidency might have been
avoided. That is certainly true, but it is an objection which
should also be directed to many institutions and agencies whose
resources far surpassour modest capabilities. We can only
remind our fellow citizens that when he asks for their votes for
his re-election, <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> also enters that court of public
opinion in which he is obliged to answer their questions. They
shouldnot waste this opportunity to grill him on all aspects of
his career and future intentions, since it is <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> who comes
forward appealing for their support. To aid in this process, we
have provided a list of TwentyQuestions forCandidate <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> on the campaign trail, and this will be found in the
appendix.</p>

<p> We do not delude ourselves that we have said the last word
about <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>. But we have for the first time sketched out at
least some of the most salient features and gathered them into a
comprehensible whole. We encourage an aroused citizenry, as well
as specialized researchers, to improve upon what we have been
able to accomplish.In sodoing, we recall the words of the
Florentine Giovanni <ent type='PERSON'>Boccaccio</ent> when he reluctantly accepted the
order of a powerful king to produce an account of the old <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent>

<p>CHAPTER 2 THE HITLER PROJECT</p>

<p>1. <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> Property Seized--Trading with the Enemy</p>

<p>In October 1942, ten months after entering <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent> II, <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>
was preparingits first assault against <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> military forces.
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was managing partner of <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent><ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>.
His 18-year-old son <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>, the future U.S. President, had just
begun training to become a naval pilot.</p>

<p> On October 20, 1942, the U.S. government ordered the seizure
of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> banking operations in <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> City which were
being conducted by <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>.</p>

<p> Under the {Trading with the Enemy Act}, the government took
over the {<ent type='ORG'>Union Banking Corporation</ent>,} in which <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was a
director. The U.S. Alien Property Custodian seized Union Banking
Corp.'s stock shares, all of which were owned by <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>,
E. <ent type='PERSON'>Roland</ent> "<ent type='PERSON'>Bunny</ent>" <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>, three <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> executives, and two
other associates of <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>.s1</p>

<p> The order seizing the bank "vest[ed] [seized] all of the
capital stock of <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking Corporation</ent>, a<ent type='ORG'>New York</ent>
corporation," and named the holders of its shares as:</p>

<p> sb|"E. <ent type='PERSON'>Roland</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>--3991 shares." <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> was chairman
and director of <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking Corp</ent>. (<ent type='ORG'>UBC</ent>); this is"<ent type='PERSON'>Bunny</ent>"
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>, described by <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> as a place holder who didn't
get much into banking affairs; <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> managed his personal
investments.</p>

<p> sb|"Cornelis <ent type='PERSON'>Lievense</ent>--4 shares." <ent type='PERSON'>Lievense</ent> was president and
director of <ent type='ORG'>UBC</ent>, and a <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> resident banking functionary for
the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s.</p>

<p> sb|"Harold D. <ent type='ORG'>Pennington</ent>--1 share." <ent type='ORG'>Pennington</ent> was treasurer
and director of <ent type='ORG'>UBC</ent>, and an office manager employed by <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> at
<ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>.</p>

<p> sb|"<ent type='PERSON'>Ray Morris</ent>--1 share." <ent type='PERSON'>Morris</ent> was director of <ent type='ORG'>UBC</ent>, anda
partner of <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>s.</p>

<p> sb|"<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> S. <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>--1 share." <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was director of <ent type='ORG'>UBC</ent>,
which was co-founded and sponsored by his father-in-law <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>; he was senior managing partner for E. <ent type='PERSON'>Roland</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> and
<ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>.</p>

<p> sb|"H.J. <ent type='PERSON'>Kouwenhoven</ent>--1 share" <ent type='PERSON'>Kouwenhoven</ent> was director of
<ent type='ORG'>UBC</ent>; he organized <ent type='ORG'>UBC</ent>as the emissary of <ent type='PERSON'>Fritz Thyssen</ent> in
negotiations with <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>; he was also
managing director ofUBC's <ent type='GPE'>Netherlands</ent> affiliate under <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
occupation; industrial executive in<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y,and also
director and chief foreign financial executive of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Steel Trust</ent>.</p>

<p> sb|"Johann G. Groeninger--1 share." Groeninger was director
of <ent type='ORG'>UBC</ent> and of its <ent type='GPE'>Netherlands</ent> affiliate; he was an industrial
executive in <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y.</p>

<p> The order also specified: "all of which shares areheld for
the benefit of ... membersof the <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> family, [and] is
property of nationals ... of a designated enemy country...."</p>

<p> By October 26, 1942, U.S. troops were underway for <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent>
<ent type='LOC'>Africa</ent>. On October 28, the government issued orders seizing two
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> front organizations run by the<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> bank: the
{<ent type='GPE'>Holland</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Trading Corporation} and the {Seamless Steel
Equipment Corporation.}s2</p>

<p> U.S. forces landed under fire nearAlgiers on November 8,
1942; heavy combat raged throughout November. <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> interests in
the {<ent type='GPE'>Silesia</ent>n-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Corporation,} long managed by <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and his father-in-law <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Herbert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>, were seized
under the Trading with the Enemy Act on November 171942. In
this action, the government announced that it was seizing only
the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> interests, leaving the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s' U.S. partners to carry on
the business.s3</p>

<p> These and other actions taken by the U.S. government in
wartime were, tragically, too little and too late.President
Bush'sfamily had already played a central role in financing and
arming <ent type='PERSON'>Adolf Hitler</ent> for his takeover of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y; in financing and
managing the buildup of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> war industries for the conquest of
Europe and war against the U.S.A.; and in the development of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
genocide theories and racial propaganda, with their well-known
results.</p>

<p> The facts presented here must be known, and their implications
reflected upon, for a proper understanding ofPresident <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Herbert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and ofthe danger to mankind that he
represents. The President's family fortune was largely a result
of the<ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>project. The powerful Anglo-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> family
associations, which later boosted him into the Central
Intelligence <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> and up to the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>, were his father's
partners in the <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> project.</p>

<p> President <ent type='PERSON'>Franklin Roosevelt</ent>'s Alien Property Custodian, Leo
T. <ent type='PERSON'>Crowley</ent>, signed Vesting Order Number 248 seizing the property
of <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> under the Trading with Enemy Act. The order,
published in obscure government record books and kept out of the
news,s4 explained nothing about the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s involved; only that the
Union BankingCorporation was run for the "<ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> family" of
"<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y and/or Hungary"--"nationals ... of a designated enemy
country."</p>

<p> By deciding that <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and the other directors of the
Union BankingCorp. were legally {front men for the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s}, the
government avoided the more important historical issue: In what
way {were Hitler's <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s themselves hired, armed, and instructed
by} the <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> clique of which <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was an
executive manager? Let us examinethe <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>
project from the 1920s until it was partially broken up, to seek
an answer for that question.</p>

<p>2. Origin and Extent of the Project</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Fritz Thyssen</ent> andhis business partners are universally
recognized as the most important <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> financiersof Adolf
Hitler's takeover of<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y. At the time of the order seizing
the <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> family's <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking Corp</ent>., Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Fritz Thyssen</ent> had
already published his famous book, {I Paid <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>},s5 admitting
that he had financed <ent type='PERSON'>Adolf Hitler</ent> and the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> movement since
October 1923.Thyssen's role as the leading early backer of
Hitler's grab for power in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y had been noted by U.S.
diplomats in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent> in 1932.s6 The order seizing the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent>
bank was curiously quiet and modest about the identity of the
perpetrators who had been nailed.</p>

<p> Buttwo weeks before the official order, government
investigators had reported secretly that "W. <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>
was in Europe sometime prior to 1924 and at that time became
acquainted with <ent type='PERSON'>Fritz Thyssen</ent>, the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> industrialist."
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> agreed to set up a bank for <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> in New
York. "[C]ertain of[Harriman's] associates would serve as
directors...." <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> agent "H.J. <ent type='PERSON'>Kouwenhoven</ent> ... came to the
<ent type='GPE'>United</ent> States ... prior to 1924 for conferences with the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>
Company in this connection...."s7</p>

<p> When exactly was "<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> in Europe sometimeprior to
1924"? In fact, he was in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent> in 1922 to set up the <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>
branch of W.A. <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> &amp; Co. under <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> Walker's presidency.</p>

<p> The <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking Corporation</ent> wasestablished formally in
1924, as a unit in the <ent type='GPE'>Manhattan</ent> offices of W.A. <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> &amp; Co.,
interlocking with the <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent>-owned {<ent type='ORG'>Bank voor Handel</ent> en
Scheepvaart} (<ent type='ORG'>BHS</ent>) inthe <ent type='GPE'>Netherlands</ent>. The investigators
concluded that "theUnion BankingCorporation has since its
inception handled funds chiefly supplied to it through the <ent type='NORP'>Dutch</ent>
bank by the <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> interests for <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> investment."</p>

<p> Thus by personal agreement between <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> and Fritz
<ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> in 1922, W.A. <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> &amp; Co. (alias Union Banking
Corporation) would be transferring funds back and forth between
<ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> and the "<ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> interests" in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y. By putting up
about $400000, the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> organization would be joint owner
and manager of Thyssen's banking operations outside of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y.</p>

<p> {How important was the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>enterprise for whichPresident
Bush's father was the <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> banker?}</p>

<p> The 1942 U.S. government investigative report said that Bush's
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>-front bank was an interlocking concern with the Vereinigte
Stahlwerke (<ent type='ORG'>United Steel Works Corporation</ent> or {<ent type='NORP'>German</ent> Steel
Trust}) led by Fritz<ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> and his two brothers.After the
war, congressional investigators probed the <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> interests,
<ent type='ORG'>Union Banking Corp</ent>. and related <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> units.The investigation
showed that <ent type='ORG'>the Vereinigte Stahlwerke</ent> had produced thefollowing
approximate proportions of total <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> national output: "50.8%
of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y's pig iron; 41.4% of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y'suniversal
plate;36.0% of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y's heavy plate; 38.5% of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y's galvanized sheet; 45.5% of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y's pipes and
tubes;22.1% of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y's wire; 35.0% of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y's
explosives."s8</p>

<p> This accounts for many, many <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> submarines, bombs, rifles,
gas chambers, etc.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> became vice president of W.A. <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> &amp; Co. in
1926. That same year, a friend of <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> set up a
giant new organization for their client <ent type='PERSON'>Fritz Thyssen</ent>, prime
sponsor of politician <ent type='PERSON'>Adolf Hitler</ent>. The new {<ent type='NORP'>German</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Steel Trust</ent>,}
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y's largest industrial corporation, was organized in 1926
by Wall Street banker <ent type='PERSON'>Clarence Dillon</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent> was the old comrade
of <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> Bush's father Sam <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> from the "Merchants of
Death" bureau in <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent> I.</p>

<p> In return for putting up $70 millionto create his
organization, majority owner <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> gave the <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent> Read company
two or more representativeson the boardof the new Steel
Trust.s9</p>

<p> Thus there is a division of labor: Thyssen's own confidential
accounts, forpolitical and related purposes, were run through
the <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> organization; the <ent type='ORG'>Steel Trust</ent> did itscorporate
banking through <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent> Read.</p>

<p> The<ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> firm's banking activities werenot just
politically neutral money-making ventures which happened to
coincide withthe aims of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s. All of the firm's
European business in those days was organized around
anti-democratic political forces.</p>

<p> In 1927, criticism of their support for totalitarianism drew
this retort from Bert<ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>, written fromKennebunkport to
<ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>: "It seems to me that the suggestion in
connection with Lord Bearsted's views that we withdraw from
<ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> smacks somewhat of the impertinent.... I think that we
have drawn our line and should hew to it."s1s0</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> met with Italy's fascistdictator, Benito
<ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent>. A representative of the firm subsequently telegraphed
good news back to his chief executive <ent type='PERSON'>Bert Walker</ent>: "... During
these last days ... <ent type='PERSON'>Mussolini</ent> ... has examined and approved our
<ent type='GPE'>c[o]ntract</ent> 15 June."s1s1</p>

<p> <ent type='GPE'>Thegreat</ent> financial collapse of1929-31 shook <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>,
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, and <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>,weakening all governments. It also made
the hard-pressed <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> even more willing to do whatever
was necessary to retain his new place in the world.It was in
this crisis that certain Anglo-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s determined on the
installation of a <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> regime in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y.</p>

<p> W.A. <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> &amp; Co., well-positioned for this enterprise and
rich in assets from their <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>nbusiness, merged
with the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> investment house, <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent>, on
January 1, 1931. <ent type='PERSON'>Bert Walker</ent> retired to his own G.H.<ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>&amp;
Co. This left the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> brothers, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, and <ent type='PERSON'>Thatcher</ent>
M. <ent type='PERSON'>Brown</ent> as the senior partners ofthe new <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> firm. (The <ent type='GPE'>London</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>England</ent> branch of the <ent type='PERSON'>Brown</ent> family
firm continued operating under its historic name--<ent type='PERSON'>Brown</ent>,
Shipley.)</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> A. <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent> also came over as a partner from <ent type='PERSON'>Brown</ent>
Brothers. His father, E.H. Harriman's lawyer and railroad chief,
had been on <ent type='ORG'>the War Industries Board</ent> with Prescott's father.
Though he remained a partner in <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>, the
junior<ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent>soon replacedhis father as chief exexcutive of
<ent type='ORG'>Union Pacific Railroad</ent>.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent> had a racial tradition that fitted it well for
the <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> project. <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> patriots had cursed its name back
in <ent type='EVENT'>Civil War days</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent>, with offices in the U.S.A.
and in <ent type='GPE'>England</ent>, had carried on their ships fully 75 percent of
the slave cotton from the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> South overto <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> mill
owners; through their usurious credit they controlled and
manipulated the slave-owners.</p>

<p> Now, in 1931, the virtual dictator of world finance, Bank of
<ent type='GPE'>England</ent> Governor <ent type='PERSON'>Montagu Collet</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Norman</ent>, was a former <ent type='PERSON'>Brown</ent>
Brothers partner, whose grandfather had been bossof <ent type='PERSON'>Brown</ent>
Brothers during the U.S. Civil War. Montagu <ent type='PERSON'>Norman</ent> was known as
the most avidof Hitler's supporters within <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> ruling
circles, and Norman's intimacy with this firm was essential to
his management of the <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> project.</p>

<p> In 1931, while <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> ran the <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> office of <ent type='PERSON'>Brown</ent>
Brothers <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>, Prescott's partner wasMontagu Norman's
intimate friend <ent type='PERSON'>Thatcher</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Brown</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>The Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>England</ent> chief always
stayedat the home of Prescott's partner on his hush-hush trips
to <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> concentrated on the firm's <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>
actitivites, and <ent type='PERSON'>Thatcher</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Brown</ent> saw to their business in old
<ent type='GPE'>England</ent>, under the guidance of his mentor Montagu <ent type='PERSON'>Norman</ent>.s1s2</p>

<p>3. Hitler's Ladder to Power</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Adolf Hitler</ent> became Chancellor of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y January 30, 1933,
and absolute dictator in March 1933, after two years of expensive
and violent lobbying and electioneering. Two affiliates of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> organization played great parts in this criminal
undertaking:Thyssen's <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Steel Trust</ent>;and the
<ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Amerika Line</ent> and several of its executives.s1s3</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Letus</ent> look moreclosely at the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>family's <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>
partners.</p>

<p> {<ent type='PERSON'>Fritz Thyssen</ent>} told <ent type='ORG'>Allied</ent> interrogators after the war about
some of his financial support for the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> Party: "In 1930 or
1931 ... I told [Hitler's deputy <ent type='PERSON'>Rudolph</ent>]Hess ... I would
arrange a credit for him with a <ent type='NORP'>Dutch</ent> bank in <ent type='GPE'>Rotterdam</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>the Bank</ent>
fuaur Handel und Schiff [i.e. <ent type='ORG'>Bank voor Handel</ent> en Scheepvaart
(<ent type='ORG'>BHS</ent>), the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> affiliate].I arranged the credit ...
he would pay it back in three years.... I chose a <ent type='NORP'>Dutch</ent> bank
because I did not want to be mixed up with <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> banks in my
position, and because I thought it was better to do business with
a <ent type='NORP'>Dutch</ent> bank, and I thought I would have the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s a little more
in my hands....</p>

<p> "The credit was about 250-300000 [gold] marks--about the sum
I had given before. The loan has been repaid in part to the
<ent type='NORP'>Dutch</ent> bank, but I think some money is still owing on it...."s1s4</p>

<p> The overall total of Thyssen's political donations and loans
to the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s was well over a million dollars, including funds he
raised from others--in a period of terrible money-shortage in
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y.</p>

<p> {<ent type='PERSON'>Friedrich Flick</ent>} was the major co-owner of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> Steel
Trust with <ent type='PERSON'>Fritz Thyssen</ent>, Thyssen's longtimecollaborator and
sometime competitor. In preparation for the war crimes tribunal
at <ent type='GPE'>Nuremberg</ent>, the U.S.government said that <ent type='PERSON'>Flick</ent> was"one of
leading financiers and industrialists who from 1932 contributed
large sums to the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> Party ... member of '<ent type='ORG'>Circle</ent> of Friends' of
<ent type='PERSON'>Himmler</ent> who contributed large sums to the SS."s1s5</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Flick</ent>, like <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent>, financed the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s to maintain their
private armies called <ent type='ORG'>Schutzstaffel</ent> (S.S. or <ent type='ORG'>Black Shirts</ent>) and
Sturmabteilung (S.A., storm troops or <ent type='PERSON'>Brown</ent> Shirts).</p>

<p> The <ent type='PERSON'>Flick</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> partnership was directly supervised by
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, President Bush's father, and by <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>,
President Bush's grandfather.</p>

<p> The <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking Corp</ent>. arrangements for the
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent><ent type='ORG'>Steel Trust</ent> had made them bankers for <ent type='PERSON'>Flick</ent> and his vast
operations in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y by no later than 1926.</p>

<p> The {<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Fifteen Corporation</ent>} (<ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>, president,
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>and <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>, sole directors) held a
substantial stake in <ent type='ORG'>the Silesian</ent> Holding Co. at the time of the
merger with <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent>, January 1, 1931. This holding
correlated to <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> Harriman's <ent type='GPE'>chairmanshipof</ent> the
{<ent type='ORG'>Consolidated Silesian Steel Corporation</ent>,} the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> group
owning one-third of a complex of steelmaking, coal-mining and
zinc-mining activities in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y and <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent>, in which Friedrich
<ent type='PERSON'>Flick</ent> owned two-thirds.s1s6</p>

<p> The <ent type='GPE'>Nuremberg</ent> prosecutor characterized <ent type='PERSON'>Flick</ent> as follows:</p>

<p> "Proprietor and head of a large group of industrial
enterprises (coal and iron mines, steel producing and fabricating
plants) ... '<ent type='NORP'>Wehrwirtschaftsfuehrer</ent>,' 1938[title awarded to
prominent industrialists for merit in armaments drive--'Military
Economy Leader']...."s1s7</p>

<p> For this buildup of the <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> war machine with coal, steel,
and arms production, using slave laborers, the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Flick</ent> was
condemned to seven years in prison at the <ent type='GPE'>Nuremberg</ent> trials; he
served three years. With friends in <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>London</ent>,
however, <ent type='PERSON'>Flick</ent> lived into the 1970s and died a billionaire.</p>

<p> On March 19, 1934, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>--then director of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Steel Trust</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking Corporation</ent>--initiated analert to
the absent <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> about a problem which had developed
in the <ent type='PERSON'>Flick</ent> partnership.s1s8 <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> sent <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> a clipping from
the {<ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> Times} of that day, which reported that the <ent type='NORP'>Polish</ent>
government was fighting back against <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>
stockholders who controlled "Poland's largest industrial unit,
<ent type='ORG'>the Upper Silesian Coal and Steel Company</ent>...."</p>

<p> The {Times} article continued: "The company has long been
accused of mismanagement,excessive borrowing, fictitious
bookkeeping and gambling in securities. Warrants were issued in
December for several directors accused of tax evasions. They
were <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> citizens and they fled. They were replaced by <ent type='NORP'>Poles</ent>.
Herr <ent type='PERSON'>Flick</ent>, regarding this as an attempt to make thecompany's
board entirely <ent type='NORP'>Polish</ent>, retaliated by restricting credits until
the new <ent type='NORP'>Polish</ent> directors were unable to pay the workmen
regularly."</p>

<p> The{Times} noted that the company's mines and mills "employ
25000 men and account for 45 percent of Poland's total steel
output and 12 percent of her coal production.Two-thirds of the
company's stock is owned by <ent type='PERSON'>Friedrich Flick</ent>, a leading <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>
steel industrialist, and the remainder is owned by interests in
<ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States."</p>

<p> In view of the fact that a great deal of <ent type='NORP'>Polish</ent> output was
being exported to Hitler's <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y under depression conditions,
the <ent type='NORP'>Polish</ent> government thought that <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>, and their <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
partners should at least pay fulltaxes on their <ent type='NORP'>Polish</ent>
holdings. The U.S. and <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> owners responded with a lockout.
The letter to <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> reported a cable from their
European representative: "Have undertaken new steps <ent type='GPE'>London</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>... please establishfriendly relations with <ent type='NORP'>Polish</ent>
Ambassador [in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>]."</p>

<p> A 1935 <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Fifteen Corporation</ent> memo from <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>
announced an agreement had been made "in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>" to sell an
8000 block of their shares in <ent type='ORG'>Consolidated Silesian Steel</ent>.s1s9
But the dispute with <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent> did not deter the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> family from
continuing its partnership with <ent type='PERSON'>Flick</ent>.</p>

<p> <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> tanksand bombs "settled" this dispute in September,
1939 with the invasion of <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent>, beginning <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent> II. The
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> army had been equipped by <ent type='PERSON'>Flick</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>, and <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>,
with materials essentially stolen from <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent>.</p>

<p> There were probably fewpeopleat the time who could
appreciate the irony, that when the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>s also attacked and
invaded <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent> from the <ent type='LOC'>East</ent>, their vehicles were fueled by oil
pumpedfrom <ent type='GPE'>Baku</ent> wells revived bythe <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>/<ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>/<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
enterprise.</p>

<p> Three years later, nearly a year after the <ent type='NORP'>Japanese</ent> attack on
Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government ordered the seizure of the
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s'share in the<ent type='GPE'>Silesia</ent>n-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Corporationunder the
Trading with the Enemy Act. Enemy nationals were said to own 49
percent of the common stock and 41.67 percent of the preferred
stock of the company.</p>

<p> The order characterized the company as a "business enterprise
within <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States, owned by [a front company in] <ent type='GPE'>Zurich</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Switzerland</ent>, and held for the benefit of Bergwerksgesell<ent type='ORG'>schaft</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> von Giesche's <ent type='PERSON'>Erben</ent>, a <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> corporation...."s2s0</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Bert Walker</ent> was still the senior directorof the company,
which he hadfounded back in 1926 simultaneously with the
creation of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Steel Trust</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Ray Morris</ent>, Prescott's
partner from <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking Corp</ent>. and <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>, was
also a director.</p>

<p> Theinvestigative report prior to the government crackdown
explained the "NATURE OF BUSINESS: The subject corporation is an
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> holding company for <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Polish</ent> subsidiaries,
which own large andvaluable coal and zinc mines in <ent type='GPE'>Silesia</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y. Since September 1939, these properties have
been in the possession of and have been operated by the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>
government and have undoubtedly been of considerable assistance
to that country in its war effort."s2s1</p>

<p> Thereportnoted that the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> stockholders hoped to
regain control of the European properties after the war.</p>

<p>4. Control of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent></p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Bert Walker</ent> had arranged the credits <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> needed to take
control of the <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Amerika Line</ent> back in 1920. <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent> had
organized the {<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Ship and <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent> Corp.} as a unit of the
W.A.<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> &amp; Co., with contractual power over
<ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-Amerika's affairs.</p>

<p> As the <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> project went into high gear, <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
shares in <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Ship and <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent> Corp. were held by the
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> Fifteen Corp., run by <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Bert Walker</ent>.s2s2</p>

<p> It was a convenient stroll for the well-tanned, athletic,
handsome <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>. From the <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>
skyscraper at59 Wall Street--where he was senior managing
partner, confidential investments manager and advisor to <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent>
and his brother "<ent type='PERSON'>Bunny</ent>"--he walked across to the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Fifteen Corporation</ent> at One Wall Street, otherwise known as G.H.
<ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>&amp; Co.--and around the corner to his subsidiary offices at
39 <ent type='LOC'>Broadway</ent>, former home of the old W.A. <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> &amp;Co., and
still the offices for <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Ship and <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent>, and of the
<ent type='ORG'>Union Banking Corporation</ent>.</p>

<p> In many ways, Bush's <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Amerika Line</ent> was the pivot for
the entire <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> project.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Bert Walker</ent> had gained control over the
steamship company in 1920 in negotiations with its post-<ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent>
I chief executive, {<ent type='PERSON'>Wilhelm Cuno</ent>}, and with the line's bankers,
M.M. <ent type='GPE'>Warburg</ent>.<ent type='PERSON'>Cuno</ent> was thereafter completely dependent on the
Anglo-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s, and became a member of the Anglo-<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>
Friendship <ent type='ORG'>Society</ent>.In the 1930-32 drive fora <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>
dictatorship, <ent type='PERSON'>Wilhelm Cuno</ent> contributed important sums to the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
Party.s2s3</p>

<p> {<ent type='PERSON'>Albert Voegler</ent>} was chiefexecutive of the <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Flick</ent>
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent><ent type='ORG'>Steel Trust</ent> for which Bush's <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking Corp</ent>. was the
<ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> office. He was a director of the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>-affiliate <ent type='ORG'>BHS</ent>
Bank in <ent type='GPE'>Rotterdam</ent>, and a director of the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Amerika Line</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Voegler</ent> joined <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Flick</ent>in their
heavy 1930-33<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> contributions, and helped organize the final
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> leap into <ent type='ORG'>national power</ent>.s2s4</p>

<p> The {<ent type='PERSON'>Schroeder</ent>} family of bankers was a linchpin for the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
activities of<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, closely tied to their
lawyers <ent type='PERSON'>Allen</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>John Foster</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>.</p>

<p> Baron <ent type='PERSON'>Kurt von Schroeder</ent> was co-director of the massive
<ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent>-Huettefoundry alongwith <ent type='PERSON'>Johann Groeninger</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent>
Bush's <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> bank partner. <ent type='PERSON'>Kurt von Schroeder</ent> wastreasurer
of the support organization for the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> Party's private armies,
to which <ent type='PERSON'>Friedrich Flick</ent> contributed.<ent type='PERSON'>Kurt von Schroeder</ent> and
Montagu Norman's proteaageaa<ent type='PERSON'>Hjalmar Schacht</ent> together made the
final arrangments for <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> to enter the government.s2s5</p>

<p> Baron <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Rudolph</ent> von <ent type='PERSON'>Schroeder</ent></ent> was vice president and director of
the <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Amerika Line</ent>. Long an intimate contact of <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent>
Harriman's in<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, Baron <ent type='PERSON'>Rudolph</ent> sent his grandson Baron
Johann <ent type='PERSON'>Rudolph</ent> for a tour of<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> Bush's <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> offices in <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> City in December 1932--on the eve of
their <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>-triumph.s2s6</p>

<p> Certain actions taken directly by the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> shipping
line in 1932 must be ranked among the gravest acts of treason in
this century.</p>

<p> TheU.S. Embassy in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent> reported back to <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> that
the "costly election campaigns" and "the cost of maintaining a
private army of 300000 to 400000 men" had raised questions as
to the<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s'financial backers. The constitutional government
of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> republic <ent type='GPE'>movedto</ent> defend national freedom by
ordering the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> Party private armies disbanded. The U.S.
Embassy reported that the {<ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Amerika Line</ent> was purchasing
and distributing propaganda attacks against the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>
government, for attempting this last-minute crackdown on Hitler's
forces.}s2s7</p>

<p> Thousands of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> opponents of<ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>ism were shot or
intimidated by privately armed <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Brown</ent>Shirts. In this
connection, we note that the original "Merchant of Death,"
Samuel<ent type='PERSON'>Pryor</ent>,was a founding director of both <ent type='ORG'>the Union</ent> Banking
Corp. and the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Ship and <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent> Corp.Since Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Pryor</ent>
was executive committee chairman of <ent type='ORG'>Remington Arms</ent> and a central
figure in the world's private arms traffic, his use to the <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>
project was enhanced as the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> family's partner in <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> Party
banking and trans-<ent type='LOC'>Atlantic</ent> shipping.</p>

<p> TheU.S. Senate arms-traffic investigators probed <ent type='ORG'>Remington</ent>
after it was joined in a cartel agreement on explosives to the
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> firm I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>. Looking at the period leading up to
Hitler's seizure of power, the senators found that "<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>
political associations, like the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> and others, are nearly all
armed with <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> ... guns.... Arms of all kinds coming from
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent> are transshipped in the <ent type='GPE'>Scheldt</ent> to river barges before
the vessels arrive in <ent type='GPE'>Antwerp</ent>. They then can be carried through
<ent type='GPE'>Holland</ent> without police inspectionor interference. The
<ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>ists and <ent type='NORP'>Communists</ent> arepresumed to get arms in this
manner. The principal armscomingfrom <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> are <ent type='ORG'>Thompson</ent>
submachine guns and revolvers.The number is great."s2s8</p>

<p> The beginning of the <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> regime brought some bizarre
changes to the <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Amerika Line</ent>--and more betrayals.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> Bush's <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Ship and <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent> Corp. notified <ent type='PERSON'>Max</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>Warburg</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, on March 7, 1933, that <ent type='GPE'>Warburg</ent> was
to bethe corporation's official, designated representative on
the board of <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Amerika</ent>.s2s9</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Max</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Warburg</ent></ent> replied on March 27, 1933, assuring his <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>
sponsors thatthe <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> government was good for <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y: "For
the last few years business was considerably better than we had
anticipated, but a reactionis making itself felt for some
months. We are actually suffering also underthe very active
propaganda against <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, caused bysome unpleasant
circumstances.These occurrences were the natural consequence of
the very excited election campaign, but were extraordinarily
exaggerated inthe foreign press.The Government is firmly
resolved to maintain public peace and order in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, andI
feel perfectly convinced in this respect that there is no cause
for any alarm whatsoever."s3s0</p>

<p> This seal of approval for <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>, coming from a famous <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>,
was just what <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> required, for they anticipated
rather serious "alarm" inside the U.S.A. against their <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
operations.</p>

<p> On March 29, 1933, two days after Max's letter to <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>,
Max's son <ent type='PERSON'>Erich</ent> sent a cable to his cousin <ent type='ORG'>Frederick</ent> M. <ent type='GPE'>Warburg</ent>,
a director ofthe <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> railroad system. He asked <ent type='ORG'>Frederick</ent>
to "use all your influence" to stop all anti-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> activity in
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, including "atrocity news and unfriendly propaganda in
foreign press, mass meetings, etc." <ent type='ORG'>Frederick</ent> cabled back to
<ent type='PERSON'>Erich</ent>: "No responsible groups here [are] urging [a] boycott [of]
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>goods[,] merely excited individuals." Two days after
that, On March 31, 1933, the {<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>,}
controlled bythe <ent type='GPE'>Warburg</ent>s,and the {B'nai B'rith,} heavily
influenced by the <ent type='PERSON'>Sulzbergers</ent>' ({NewYork Times}),issueda
formal, official joint statement of the two organizations,
counselling "that no <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> boycott against <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y be
encouraged, [and advising] ... that no further mass meetings be
held or similar forms of agitation be employed."s3s1</p>

<p> The <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> and the B'nai B'rith (mother of
the "Anti-DefamationLeague") continued with this hardline,
no-attack-on-<ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> stance all through the 1930s, blunting the
fight mounted by many <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s and other anti-fascists.</p>

<p> Thus the decisive interchange reproduced above, taking place
entirely within the orbit of the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>/<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> firm, may explain
something of the relationship of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> to <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish
and <ent type='NORP'>Zionist</ent> leaders. Some of them, in close cooperation with his
family, played an ugly part in the drama of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>ism. Is this why
"professional <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>-hunters" have never discovered how the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
family made its money?</p>

<p> The executive board of the {<ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent><ent type='ORG'>Amerika Line</ent>}{(<ent type='ORG'>Hapag</ent>)}
met jointly with the <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> Lloyd company board in <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>
on September 5, 1933. Under official <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> supervision, the two
firms were merged. <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> Bush's <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Ship and <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent>
Corp.installed <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> J. <ent type='ORG'>Beck</ent>, a longtime <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>
executive, as manager of freight and operations in <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>
for the new joint <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> shipping lines {(<ent type='ORG'>Hapag</ent>-Lloyd)}) on
November 4, 1933.</p>

<p> According to testimony of officials of the companies before
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> in 1934, a supervisor from the {<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> Labor Front} rode
with every ship of the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> line; employees of <ent type='EVENT'>the New</ent>
York offices were directly organized into the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> Labor Front
organization; <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Amerika</ent> provided free passage to
individuals going abroad for <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> propaganda purposes; and the
line subsidized pro-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> newspapers in the U.S.A., as it had done
in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y against the constitutional <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> government.s3s2</p>

<p> In mid-1936, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> Bush's <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Ship and <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent> Corp.
cabled M.M. <ent type='GPE'>Warburg</ent>, asking <ent type='GPE'>Warburg</ent> torepresent thecompany's
heavyshareinterest atthe forthcoming <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Amerika</ent>
stockholders meeting. The <ent type='GPE'>Warburg</ent> office repliedwith the
information that "we represented you" at the stockholders
meeting and "exercised on your behalf your voting power for Rm
[gold marks] 3509600 <ent type='ORG'>Hapag</ent> stock deposited with us."</p>

<p> The <ent type='GPE'>Warburg</ent>s transmitted a letter received from Emil
<ent type='PERSON'>Helfferich</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> chief executive of both <ent type='ORG'>Hapag</ent>-Lloyd and of the
<ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> subsidiary in <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y: "It is the intention to
continue the relations with Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> on the samebasis as
heretofore...." In a colorful gesture, Hapag's <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> chairman
<ent type='PERSON'>Helfferich</ent> sent the line's president across the <ent type='LOC'>Atlantic</ent> ona
Zeppelin to confer with their <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> string-pullers.</p>

<p> After the meeting with theZeppelin passenger, the
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> office replied: "I am glad to learnthat Mr.
<ent type='PERSON'>Hellferich</ent> [sic] hasstated that relations between the <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Line and ourselves will be continued on the same basis
as heretofore."s3s3</p>

<p> Two months before moving against Bush's <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking Corp</ent>.,
the U.S. government ordered the seizure of all property of the
<ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Amerika Line</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> Lloyd, under the Trading
with the Enemy Act. The investigators noted in the pre-seizure
reportthat <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> J. <ent type='ORG'>Beck</ent> was still acting as an attorney
representing the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> firm.s3s4</p>

<p> In May 1933, just after the <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> regime was consolidated, an
agreement was reached in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent> for the coordination of all <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
commerce with the U.S.A. The {<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> International Co.,} led by
<ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> Harriman's first cousin <ent type='PERSON'>Oliver</ent>, was to head a syndicate
of 150 firms and individuals, to conduct {all exports from
Hitler's <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y to <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States}.s3s5</p>

<p> This pact had been negotiated in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent> between Hitler's
economics minister, <ent type='PERSON'>Hjalmar Schacht</ent>, and <ent type='PERSON'>John Foster</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>,
international attorney for dozens of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> enterprises, with the
counsel of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Max</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Warburg</ent></ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Kurt von Schroeder</ent>.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>John Foster</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> would later be U.S. Secretary of State, and
the great power in <ent type='ORG'>the Republican Party</ent> of the 1950s. Foster's
friendship and that of his brother <ent type='PERSON'>Allen</ent> (head of the Central
Intelligence <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>), greatly aided <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> to become the
<ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> U.S. senator from Connecticut. And it was to be of
inestimable value to <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>, in his ascent to the heights of
"covert action government," that both of these <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> brothers
were the lawyers for the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> family's far-flung enterprise.</p>

<p> <ent type='GPE'>Throughoutthe</ent> 1930s, <ent type='PERSON'>John Foster</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> arranged debt
restructuring for <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> firms under a series of decrees issued
by <ent type='PERSON'>Adolf Hitler</ent>. In these deals, <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> struck a balance between
the interest owed to selected, larger investors, and the needs of
the growing <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> warmaking apparatus for producing tanks, poison
gas, etc.</p>

<p> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> wrote to <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent><ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> in 1937 concerning one such
arrangement. The <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>-<ent type='LOC'>Atlantic</ent> Cable Company, owning <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y's only telegraph channel to <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States, had made
debt and management agreements with the <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> bank
during the 1920s. A new decree would now void those agreements,
which had originallybeen reached with non-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>corporate
officials. <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> asked <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, whomanaged these affairs for
<ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>, to get Averell's signature on a letter to <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
officials, agreeing to the changes. <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> wrote:</p>

<p>"Sept. 22, 1937
"Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> S. <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
"59 Wall Street, New
York, N.Y.</p>

<p> "Dear <ent type='ORG'>Press</ent>,
"I have looked over the letter of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> [sic]
Cable Companyto <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>.... It would appear that the
only rights in the matter are those which inure in the bankers
and that no legal embarrassment would result, so far as the
bondholders are concerned, by your acquiescence in the
modification of the bankers' agreement.
"Sincerely yours,
"<ent type='PERSON'>John Foster</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>"</p>

<p> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> enclosed aproposed draft reply, <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> got Harriman's
signature, and the changes went through.s3s6</p>

<p> In conjunction with these arrangements, the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Atlantic</ent>
Cable Companyattempted to stop payment on its debts to smaller
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> bondholders. The money was to be used instead for
arming the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> state, under a decree of the <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> government.</p>

<p> Despite the busy efforts of <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>, a <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> court
decided that this particular <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> "law" was invalid in the
<ent type='GPE'>United</ent>States; smallbondholders, not parties to deals between
the bankers and the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s, were entitled to get paid.s3s7</p>

<p> In this and a few other of the attempted swindles, the
intended victims came out with their money. But the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
financial and political reorganization went ahead to its tragic
climax.</p>

<p> Forhis part in the <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> revolution, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was paid
a fortune.</p>

<p> This is the legacy he left to his son, President <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>.</p>

<p>Chapter 3 RACE HYGIENE: Three <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> Family Alliances "The
[government] must put the most modern medical means in the
service of this knowledge.... Those who are physically and
mentally unhealthy and unworthy must not perpetuate their
suffering in the body of their children....The prevention of
the faculty and opportunity toprocreate on the part of the
physically degenerateand mentally sick, over a period of only
600 years, would ... free humanity froman immeasurable
misfortune."s1</p>

<p> "The per capita income gap between the developed and the
developing countries is increasing, in large part the result of
higher birth rates in the poorer countries.... Famine in India,
unwanted babies in <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States, poverty that seemed to form
an unbreakable chain for millions of people--how should we tackle
these problems?.... It is quite clearthat one of the major
challenges ofthe 1970s ... will be to curb the world's
fertility."</p>

<p>These two quotations are alike in their mock show of concern for
human suffering, and in their cynical remedy for it: Big Brother
must prevent the "unworthy" or "unwanted" people from
living.
<ent type='ORG'>Letus</ent> now further inquire into the family background of our
President, so as to help illustrate how the second quoted author,
{<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>}s1 came to share the outlook of the first, {Adolf
<ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>}.s2
We shall examine here the alliance of the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> family with
three other families: {<ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent>} and {<ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent>.}
The private associations among these families have led to the
President's relationship tohis closest, most confidential
advisers. These alliances were forged in the earlier <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>
project and its immediate aftermath. Understanding them will
help us to explain <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>'s obsession with the supposed
overpopulation of the world's non-Anglo-<ent type='NORP'>Saxon</ent>s, and the dangerous
means he has adopted to deal with this "problem."</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent></p>

<p> When <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> was elected vice president in 1980, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>
mystery man <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> Stamps <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> III</ent> took over management of all
of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>'s personal wealth in a "blind trust."Known as
one of the richest men in <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Will Farish</ent> keeps his business
affairs under the most intense secrecy. Only the source of his
immense wealth is known, not its employment.s3
<ent type='PERSON'>Will Farish</ent> has long been Bush's closest friend and
confidante. He is also the unique private host toBritain's
Queen <ent type='PERSON'>Elizabeth</ent>: <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> owns and boards the studs which mate with
the Queen's mares. That is her public rationale when she comes
to <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> and stays in Farish's house. It is a vital link in
the mind of our <ent type='NORP'>Anglophile</ent> President.
President <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> can count on <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> not to betray the violent
secrets surrounding the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> family money. For Farish's own
familyfortune was made inthe same <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> project, in a
nightmarish partnership with <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>'s father.</p>

<p> On March 25, 1942, U.S. Assistant Attorney General Thurman
<ent type='PERSON'>Arnold</ent>announced that <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> Stamps <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> (grandfather of the
President's money manager) had pleaded "no contest" to charges
of criminal conspiracy with the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s. <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> was the principal
manager of a worldwide cartel between <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent>Oil Co. of New
Jersey and the I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> concern.The merged enterprise had
opened the <ent type='ORG'>Auschwitz</ent> slave labor camp on June 141940, to
produce artificial rubber and gasoline from coal. The <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>
government supplied political opponents and <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s as the slaves,
who were worked to near death and then murdered.
<ent type='PERSON'>Arnold</ent> disclosed that <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent> (later known
as <ent type='ORG'>Exxon</ent>), of which <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> was president and chief executive, had
agreedto stop hiding from<ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States patents for
artificial rubber which the company had provided to the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s.s4
A Senate investigating committeeunder Senator (later U.S.
President) <ent type='PERSON'>Harry Truman</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Missouri</ent> had called <ent type='PERSON'>Arnold</ent> to testify
at hearings on corporations' collaboration with the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s. The
Senators expressed outrage at the cynicalway <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> was
continuing an alliance with the <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> regime that had begun back
in 1933, when <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> became chief of <ent type='ORG'>Jersey Standard</ent>. Didn't he
know there was a war on?
The Justice Department laid before the committee a letter,
written to <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> president <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> by his vice president,
shortly after the beginning of <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent> II (September1, 1939)
in Europe. The letter concerned <ent type='GPE'>arenewal</ent> of their earlier
agreements with the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s:</p>

<p>Report on European Trip Oct. 12, 1939 Mr. W.S. <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> 30
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Plaza</p>

<p> Dear Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent>:
... I stayed in <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> until Sept. 17th.... In <ent type='GPE'>England</ent> I met
by appointment the Royal <ent type='NORP'>Dutch</ent> [<ent type='ORG'>Shell Oil</ent> Co.] gentlemen from
<ent type='GPE'>Holland</ent>, and ... a general agreement was reached on the necessary
changes in our relations with the I.G. [<ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>], in view of the
state of war.... [T]he Royal <ent type='NORP'>Dutch</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent> group is essentially
<ent type='NORP'>British</ent>.... <ent type='ORG'>Ialso</ent> had several meetings with ... the [<ent type='NORP'>British</ent>]
Air Ministry....
I required help to obtain the necessary permission to go to
<ent type='GPE'>Holland</ent>.... After discussions with the [<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>] Ambassador
[<ent type='PERSON'>Joseph</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>] the situation was cleared completely.... The
gentlemen in <ent type='ORG'>the Air Ministry</ent> ... very kindly offered to assist
me [later] in reentering <ent type='GPE'>England</ent>....
Pursuant to thesearrangements, I was able to keep my
appointments in <ent type='GPE'>Holland</ent> [having flown there on a <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> Royal
<ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> bomber], where I had three days of discussion with the
representatives of I.G. They delivered to me assignments of some
2000 foreign patents and {we did our best to work out complete
plans for a modus vivendi which could operate through the term of
the war, whether or not the U.S. came in....} [emphasis added]
Very truly yours, <ent type='ORG'>F[rank</ent>] A. Howards5</p>

<p> Here are some cold realities behind the tragedy of <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent>
II, which help explain the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> family alliance--and their
peculiar closeness to the Queen of <ent type='GPE'>England</ent>:
sb|<ent type='ORG'>Shell Oil</ent> is principally owned by the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> Royal
family. Shell's chairman, Sir <ent type='PERSON'>Henri</ent> Deterding, helped sponsor
Hitler's rise to power,s6 by arrangement with the <ent type='ORG'>Royal Family</ent>'s
Bank of <ent type='GPE'>England</ent> Governor, Montagu <ent type='PERSON'>Norman</ent>. Their ally, <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent>
Oil, would take part in the <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> project right up to the
bloody, gruesome end.
sb|When grandfather <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> signed the Justice Department's
consent decree in March 1942, the government had already started
picking its way through the tangled web of world-monopoly oil and
chemical agreements between <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> and the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s. Many
patents and other <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>-owned aspects of the partnership had been
seized by the U.S. Alien Property Custodian.
<ent type='PERSON'>Uncle Sam</ent> would not seize <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> Bush's Union Banking
Corporation for another seven months.
The <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> axis had begun back in 1929. In that year, the
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> bank bought <ent type='PERSON'>Dresser</ent> Industries, supplier of oil-pipeline
couplers to <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> and other companies. <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> became a
director and financialczar of <ent type='PERSON'>Dresser</ent>, installinghis <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent>
classmate <ent type='PERSON'>Neil Mallon</ent> as chairman.s7 <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> would later name
one of his sons after the <ent type='PERSON'>Dresser</ent> executive.
<ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> S. <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> was the main organizer of <ent type='ORG'>the Humble Oil</ent> Co.
of <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, which <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> merged into the <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> Company of
<ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> built up the Humble-<ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> empire of
pipelines and refineries in <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>.s8
Thestock market crashed just after the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> family got into
the oil business. The world financial crisis led to the merger
of the <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> bank with <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent> in 1931. Former
<ent type='PERSON'>Brown</ent> partner Montagu <ent type='PERSON'>Norman</ent> and his protege <ent type='PERSON'>Hjalmar Schacht</ent>, who
was to become Hitler's economics minister, paid frantic visits to
<ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> that year and the next, preparing the new <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> regime
for <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> on Eugenics</p>

<p> The mostimportant <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> political event in those
preparations for <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> was the infamous Third International
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> on Eugenics, held at NewYork's <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Museum of
Natural History August 21-23, 1932, supervised by the
International <ent type='ORG'>Fed</ent>eration of Eugenics Societies.s9 This meeting
took up the stubborn persistence of <ent type='NORP'>African</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s and other
allegedly "inferior" and "socially inadequate"groups in
reproducing, expanding their numbers, and "amalgamating" with
others. It was recommendedthat these "dangers" to the
"better" ethnic groups and to the "well-born," could be dealt
with by sterilization or "cutting off the bad stock" of the
"unfit."
Italy's fascist government sent an official representative.
<ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> Harriman's sister <ent type='PERSON'>Mary</ent>, director of "entertainment" for
the <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, lived down in <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> fox-hunting country; her
state supplied the speaker on "racial purity," W.A. <ent type='ORG'>Plecker</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> commissioner of vital statistics. <ent type='ORG'>Plecker</ent> reportedly
held the delegates spellbound with his account of the struggle to
stop race-mixing and interracial sex in <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent>.
The<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> proceedings were dedicated to <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> Harriman's
mother; she had paidfor the founding ofthe race-science
movement in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> back in 1910, building the Eugenics Record
Office as a branch of the Galton National Laboratory in <ent type='GPE'>London</ent>.
She and other <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>s were usually escorted to the horse races
by old <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Herbert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>--they shared with the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>es and the
<ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent>es a fascination with "breeding thoroughbreds" among
horses and humans.s1s0
<ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> personally arranged with the <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>/<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Amerika Line</ent> to transport <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> ideologues from <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y to
<ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> for this meeting.s1s1 The most famous among those
transported was Dr. Ernst Rudin, psychiatrist at the Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute for Genealogy and Demography in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>, where
the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> family paid for Dr.Rudin to occupy an entire
floor with his eugenics "research." Dr. Rudin had addressed the
International <ent type='ORG'>Fed</ent>eration's 1928 <ent type='GPE'>Munich</ent> meeting, speaking on
"<ent type='ORG'>Mental Aberration and Race Hygiene</ent>," while others (<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>s and
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s) spoke on race-mixing and sterilization of the unfit.
Rudin had led the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> delegation to the 1930 Mental Hygiene
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C.
At the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>s' 1932 <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> Eugenics <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, Ernst Rudin
was unanimously elected President of the International <ent type='ORG'>Fed</ent>eration
of Eugenics Societies. This was recognition of Rudin as founder
of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Society</ent> for Race Hygiene, with his co-founder,
Eugenics <ent type='ORG'>Fed</ent>eration vice president <ent type='PERSON'>Alfred Ploetz</ent>.
As depression-maddened financiersschemed in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent> and New
York, Rudin was now official leader of the world eugenics
movement. Components of his movement included groups with
overlapping leadership, dedicated to:
sb|sterilization of mental patients ("mental hygiene
societies");
sb|execution of the insane, criminals and the terminally ill
("euthanasia societies"); and
sb|eugenical race-purification by prevention of births to
parents from inferior blood stocks ("birth control
societies").</p>

<p> Before the <ent type='ORG'>Auschwitz</ent> death camp became a household word, these
<ent type='NORP'>British</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>-European groups called openly for the
elimination of the "unfit" by means including force and
violence.s1s2
Ten months later, in June 1933, Hitler's interior minister
<ent type='PERSON'>Wilhelm Frick</ent> spoke to a eugenics meeting in the new <ent type='ORG'>Third Reich</ent>.
<ent type='PERSON'>Frick</ent> called the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>s a"degenerate"race, denouncing
one-fifth of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y's parentsfor producing"feeble-minded"
and "defective" children. The following month, on a commission
by <ent type='PERSON'>Frick</ent>, Dr. Ernst Rudin wrote the "Law for the Prevention of
Hereditary Diseases in Posterity," the sterilization law modeled
on previous U.S. statutes in <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> and other states.
Special courts were soon established for the sterilization of
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent> mental patients, the blind, the deaf, and alcoholics.A
quarter million people in these categorieswere sterilized.
Rudin, <ent type='ORG'>Ploetz</ent>, and their colleagues trained a whole generation of
physicians and psychiatrists--as sterilizers and as killers.
When the war started, the eugenicists, doctors, and
psychiatrists staffed the new "T4" agency, which planned and
supervised the mass killings: first at "euthanasia centers,"
where the same categories which had firstbeen subject to
sterilization were now to be murdered, their brains sent in lots
of 200 to experimental psychiatrists; then at slave camps such as
<ent type='ORG'>Auschwitz</ent>; and finally, for <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s andother race victims, at
straight extermination <ent type='ORG'>campsin</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent>, such as <ent type='PERSON'>Treblinka</ent> and
<ent type='PERSON'>Belsen</ent>.s1s3
In 1933, as what <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> called his"New Order"appeared,
<ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>,Jr. appointed<ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> S. <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> the
chairman of <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> Co. of <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent> (in 1937 he was made
president and chief executive). <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> moved his offices to
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Center, <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent>, where he spent a good deal of time
with <ent type='PERSON'>Hermann Schmitz</ent>, chairman of I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>; his company paid a
publicity man,Ivy <ent type='PERSON'>Lee</ent>, to write pro-I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> and pro-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
propaganda and get it into the U.S. press.
Now that he was outside of <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> found himself in the
shipping business--like the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> family. He hired <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>
crews for <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> tankers. And he hired {<ent type='PERSON'>Emil Helfferich</ent>,}
chairman of the <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>/<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>/<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Amerika Line</ent>, as
chairman also of the <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> Company subsidiary in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y.
<ent type='PERSON'>Karl Lindemann</ent>, board member of <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Amerika</ent>, also became a
top <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> executive in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y.s1s4
This interlock between their <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> operations put <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent>
together with <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> ina small, select group of men
operating from abroad through Hitler's "revolution," and
calculating that they would never be punished.
In 1939, Farish's daughter <ent type='PERSON'>Martha</ent> married <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> Harriman's
nephew, Edward <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Gerry</ent>, and <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> in-laws became <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent>
Bush's partners at 59 <ent type='LOC'>Broadway</ent>.s1s5
Both <ent type='PERSON'>Emil Helfferich</ent> and<ent type='PERSON'>Karl Lindemann</ent> were authorized to
write checks to Heinrich <ent type='PERSON'>Himmler</ent>, chief of the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> SS, ona
special <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> account. This account was managed by the
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>British</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> banker, <ent type='PERSON'>Kurt von Schroeder</ent>. According to
U.S. intelligence documents reviewed by author <ent type='PERSON'>Anthony Sutton</ent>,
<ent type='PERSON'>Helfferich</ent> continued his payments to the SS into 1944,when the
SS was supervising the mass murder at the <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent>-I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Auschwitz</ent> and other death camps. <ent type='PERSON'>Helfferich</ent> told <ent type='ORG'>Allied</ent>
interrogators after the warthat these were not his personal
contributions--they were corporate <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> funds.s1s6
After pleading "no contest" to charges of criminal
conspiracy with the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s, <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent>Stamps<ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent>was fined
$5000. (Similar fines were levied against <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent>--$5000
each for the parent company and for several subsidiaries.) This
of course did not interfere with the millionsof dollars that
<ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent>had acquired in conjunction with Hitler's New Order, as a
large stockholder, chairman, and president of <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent>Oil. All
the government sought was the use of patents which his company
had given to the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s--the <ent type='ORG'>Auschwitz</ent> patents--but had withheld
from the U.S. military and industry.
<ent type='PERSON'>Buta</ent> warwas on, and if young men were to be asked to die
fighting <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> something more was needed. <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> was hauled
beforethe Senate committee investigating the national defense
program. The committee chairman, Senator <ent type='PERSON'>Harry Truman</ent>, told
newsmen before <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> testified: "I think this approaches
treason."s1s7
<ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> began breaking apart at these hearings. He shouted his
"indignation" at the senators, and claimed <ent type='PERSON'>hewas</ent> not
"disloyal."
After the March-April hearings ended, more dirt came gushing
out of the Justice Department and the<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> on <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> and
<ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent>.<ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent>had deceived the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> to prevent the
<ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> from acquiring certain patents, while supplying them to the
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> war machine; meanwhile, he was supplying gasoline and
tetraethyl lead to <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y's submarines and air force.
Communications between <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> and I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> from the outbreak
of <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent>II were released tothe Senate, showing that
Farish's organization had arranged to deceive the U.S. government
into passing over <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>-owned assets: They would nominally buy
I.G.'sshare in certain patents because "in the event of war
between ourselves and <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y ... it would certainly be very
undesireable to havethis 20 percent <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent>-I.G. pass to an
alien property custodian of the U.S. who might sell it to an
unfriendly interest."s1s8
<ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, Jr. (father of <ent type='PERSON'>David</ent>, Nelson, and <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent>
D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> III), the controlling owner of <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent>, told
the <ent type='PERSON'>Roosevelt</ent> administration that he knew nothing of the
day-to-day affairs of his company, that all these matters were
handled by <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> and other executives.s1s9
In August, <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> was brought back for more testimony. He was
now frequently accused of lying. <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> was crushed under the
intense, public grilling; he became morose, ashen. While
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> escaped publicity when the government seized his
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> banking organization in October, <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> had been nailed. He
collapsed and died of a heart attack on November 29, 1942.
The <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> family was devastated by the exposure. <ent type='PERSON'>Son William</ent>
Stamps<ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent>, Jr., a lieutenant in <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent></ent>, was
humiliated by the public knowledge that his father was fueling
the enemy's aircraft; he died in a training accident in <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> six
months later.s2s0
With this double death, the fortune comprising much of
<ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent>'s profits from <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y was now to be
settled upon the little four-year-old grandson, <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent>
("Will") Stamps <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> III. <ent type='PERSON'>Will Farish</ent> grew up a recluse, the
most secretive multimillionaire in <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, with investments of
"that money" in a multitude of foreign countries, and a host of
exoticcontacts overlapping the intelligence andfinancial
worlds--particularly in <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>.
The <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> axis started <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>'s career.After his
1948 graduation from <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> (and the<ent type='ORG'>Skull</ent> and Bones secret
society), <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> flew down to <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> on a corporate jet and
was employed by his father's <ent type='PERSON'>Dresser</ent> Industries. In a couple of
years he got help from his uncle, <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>, Jr., and
Farish's <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> banker friends, to set him up in the oil
property speculation business. Soon thereafter, <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>
founded the <ent type='PERSON'>Zapata</ent> Oil Company, which put oil drilling rigs into
certain locations of great strategic interest to the
Anglo-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> intelligence community.
Twenty-five-year-old <ent type='PERSON'>Will Farish</ent> was personal aide to <ent type='PERSON'>Zapata</ent>
chairman <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> in Bush's unsuccessful 1964 campaign for
Senate. <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> used "that <ent type='ORG'>Auschwitz</ent> money" to back <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>
financially, investing in <ent type='PERSON'>Zapata</ent>. When <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was elected to
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> in 1966, <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> joined the <ent type='PERSON'>Zapata</ent> board.s2s1
When <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> became U.S. vice-president in 1980, the
<ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> family fortunes were again completely, secretly
commingled. As we shall see, the old projects were now being
revived on a breathtaking scale.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent></p>

<p> Twenty years before he was U.S. President, <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>
brought two "race-science" professors in front of the
<ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> Task Force on Earth Resources and Population. As
chairman of <ent type='ORG'>the Task Force</ent>, then-<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>man <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> invited
Professors <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> Shockley and <ent type='PERSON'>Arthur Jensen</ent> to explain to the
committee how allegedly runaway birth-rates for <ent type='NORP'>African</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s
were "down-breeding" the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> population.
Afterwards, <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> personally summed up for the <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> the
testimony his black-inferiority advocates had given to the Task
Force.s2s2 <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> held his hearings on the threat posed by
black babies on August 5, 1969, while much of the world was in a
better frame of mind--celebrating mankind's progress from the
first moon landing 16 days earlier. Bush's obsessive thinking on
this subject was guided by his family's friend, Gen. <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> H.
<ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent>, Jr., the founder and chairman of the Population Crisis
<ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>, and vice chairman of the <ent type='ORG'>Planned Parenthood</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Fed</ent>eration. <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> had long been steering U.S. public discussion
about the so-called "population bomb" in the non-white areas of
the world.
If <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>man <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> had explained to his colleagues {how his
family had come to know General <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent>,} they would perhaps have
felt some alarm, or even panic, and paid more healthy attention
to Bush's presentation. Unfortunately,the <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
population doctrine is now official U.S. foreign policy.
<ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> H. <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent>, Jr. had joined the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> team in 1927, when
he was hired by <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent> Read &amp; Co., <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> investment bankers.
<ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> was put into a new job slot at the firm: handling the
<ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> account.
We recall that in 1924, <ent type='PERSON'>Fritz Thyssen</ent> set up his Union Banking
Corporation in <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Herbert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>’s bank at 39<ent type='LOC'>Broadway</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Manhattan</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent> Read &amp; Co.'s boss, <ent type='PERSON'>Clarence Dillon</ent>, had begun
working with <ent type='PERSON'>Fritz Thyssen</ent> some time after <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> first
met with <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent>--at about the time <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> began financing Adolf
Hitler's political career.
In January 1926, <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent> Read created the {<ent type='NORP'>German</ent> Credit and
Investment Corporation} in <ent type='GPE'>Newark</ent>,<ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>,
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, as Thyssen's short-term banker. That same year, <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent>
Read created the {<ent type='PERSON'>Vereinigte Stahlwerke</ent>} (<ent type='NORP'>German</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Steel Trust</ent>),
incorporating the <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> family interests under the direction of
<ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> finance.s2s3
<ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> H. <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent>, Jr. was made director, vice president, and
assistant treasurer of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> Credit and Investment Corp. His
business was short-term loans and financial management tricks for
<ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> and the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Steel Trust</ent>. Draper's clients sponsored
Hitler's terroristic takeover; his clients led the buildup of the
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> war industry; his clients made war against <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent>
States. The <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s were Draper's direct partners in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent> and New
Jersey: <ent type='PERSON'>Alexander Kreuter</ent>, residing in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>, was president;
Frederic Brandi, whose father was a top coal executive in the
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Steel Trust</ent>, moved to <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States in 1926 and served
as Draper's co-director in <ent type='GPE'>Newark</ent>.
Draper's role was crucial for <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent> Read &amp; Co., for whom
<ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> was a partner and eventually vice president. The <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>
Credit and Investment Corp.(<ent type='ORG'>GCI</ent>) was a "front" for <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent>
Read: It had the same <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent> address as U.S. &amp; International
Securities Corp. (<ent type='ORG'>USIS</ent>), and the same man served as treasurer of
both firms.s2s4
<ent type='PERSON'>Clarence Dillon</ent> and his son C. Douglas <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent> were directors
of <ent type='ORG'>USIS</ent>, which was spotlighted when <ent type='PERSON'>Clarence Dillon</ent> was hauled
before the Senate Banking Committee's famous "<ent type='ORG'>Pecora</ent>" hearings
in 1933. <ent type='ORG'>USIS</ent> was shown to be one of the great speculative
pyramid schemes which had swindled stockholders of hundreds of
millions of dollars. These investment policies had rotted the
U.S. economy to the core, and led to <ent type='EVENT'>the Great Depression</ent> of the
1930s.
But <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> H. <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent>, Jr.'s <ent type='ORG'>GCI</ent> "front" was not
{apparently} affiliated with the <ent type='ORG'>USIS</ent> "front" or with <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent>,
and the <ent type='ORG'>GCI</ent> escaped the congressmen's limited scrutiny. This
oversight was to prove most unfortunate, particularly to the 50
million people who subsequently died in <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent> II.
<ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent> Read hired public relations man Ivy <ent type='PERSON'>Lee</ent> to prepare
their executives for their testimony and to confuse and further
baffle the congressmen.s2s5 <ent type='PERSON'>Lee</ent> apparently took enough time out
from his duties as image-maker for <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> S. <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> and the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> Co.; he managed the congressional thinking so that
the congressmen did not disturb the <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> operation in
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y--and did not meddle with <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent>, or interfere with
Hitler's U.S. money men.
Thus, in 1932, <ent type='GPE'>Willam</ent> H. <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent>, Jr. was free to finance the
International Eugenics <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> as a "Supporting Member."s2s6
Was reusing his own income as a <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> trust banker? Or did
the funds come from <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent> Read corporate accounts, perhaps to be
written off income tax as "expenses for <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> project: race
purification"? <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> helped select Ernst Rudin as chief of the
world eugenics movement, who used his office to promote what he
called <ent type='PERSON'>Adolf Hitler</ent>'s "holy, national and international racial
hygienic mission."s2s7
W.S. <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> was publicly exposed in 1942, humiliated and
destroyed. Just before <ent type='PERSON'>Farish</ent> died, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> Bush's <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> banking
office was quietly seized and shut down. But <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent>’s close
friend and partner in the <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> business, <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> H.
<ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent>, Jr., {neither died nor moved out of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> affairs.}
<ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> listed himself as a director of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> Credit and
Investment Corp. through 1942, and the firm was not liquidated
until November1943.s2s8 <ent type='PERSON'>Buta</ent> war was on. <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent>, a colonel
from previous military service, went off to the <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> theater
and became a general.
General <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> apparently had a hobby:magic--illusions,
sleight of hand, etc.--and he was a member of <ent type='ORG'>the Society</ent> of
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Magicians. This is not irrelevant to his subsequent
career.
The <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> regime surrendered in May 1945. In July 1945, General
<ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> was called to Europe by the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> military government
authorities in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y. <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> was appointed head of the
Economics Division of the U.S. Control Commission. He was
assigned to take apart the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> corporate cartels. There is an
astonishing but perfectly logical rationale to this--<ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> knew
a lot about the subject! General <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent>, who had spent about 15
years financing and managing the dirtiest of the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
enterprises, was now authorized to decide {who was exposed, who
lost and who kept his business, and in practical effect, who was
prosecuted for war crimes.}s2s9
(<ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> was not unique within the postwar occupation
government. Consider the case of <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> J. McCloy, U.S. Military
Governor and High Commissioner of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, 1949-1952. Under
instructions from his Wall Street law firm, McCloy had lived for
a year in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, serving as an adviser to the fascist government
of <ent type='PERSON'>Benito Mussolini</ent>. An intimate collaborator of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>/<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> bank, McCloy had sat in <ent type='PERSON'>Adolf Hitler</ent>'s box at the
1936 <ent type='EVENT'>Olympic</ent> games in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>, at the invitation of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
chieftains <ent type='PERSON'>Rudolf Hess</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Hermann Goering</ent>.)s3s0</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> H. <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent>, Jr., as a "conservative," was paired with
the "liberal" U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent> Secretary <ent type='PERSON'>Henry Morgenthau</ent> in a
vicious game. <ent type='PERSON'>Morgenthau</ent> demanded that <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y be utterly
destroyed as a nation, that its industry be dismantled and it be
reduced to a purely rural country. As the economic boss in 1945
and 1946, <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> "protected" <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y from the <ent type='PERSON'>Morgenthau</ent> Plan
... but at a price.
<ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> and his colleagues demanded that <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y and the world
accept the {collective guilt of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> people} as {the
}explanation for the rise of Hitler's New Order, and the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> war
crimes. This, of course, was rather convenient for General
<ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> himself, as it was for the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> family. It is still
convenient decades later, allowing Prescott's son,President
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, to lecture <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y on the danger of <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>ism. <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>s are
too slow, it seems, to accept his <ent type='EVENT'>New World</ent> Order.
After several years of government service (often working
directly for <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> in the <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Atlantic</ent> Alliance),
<ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> was appointed in 1958 chairman of a committee which was to
advise President <ent type='PERSON'>Dwight Eisenhower</ent> on the proper course for U.S.
military aid to other countries. At that time, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was
a U.S. senator from Connecticut, a confidential friend and golf
partner with <ent type='ORG'>National Security</ent> Director <ent type='PERSON'>Gordon</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent>, and an
important golf partner with <ent type='PERSON'>Dwight Eisenhower</ent> as well.
Prescott's old lawyer from the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> days, <ent type='PERSON'>John Foster</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>, was
Secretary of State, and his brother <ent type='PERSON'>Allen</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>, formerly of the
Schroder bank, was head of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.
This friendly environment emboldened our General <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> to
pull off a stunt with his military aid advisory committee. He
changed the subject under study. The following year, the <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent>
committee recommended that the U.S. government react to the
supposed threat of the "population explosion" by formulating
plans to depopulate the poorer countries. The growth of the
world's non-white population, he proposed, should be regarded as
dangerous to the national security of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States!s3s1
President <ent type='PERSON'>Eisenhower</ent> rejected the recommendation. But in the
next decade, General <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> founded the "Population Crisis
<ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>" and the "<ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> Fund," joining with the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
and DuPont families to promote eugenics as "population
control." The administration of President Lyndon <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent>son,
advised by <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> on the subject, began financing birth control
in the tropical countries through the <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> for International
Development.
General <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> was <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>'s guru on the
population question.s3s2 But there was also Draper's money--from
that uniquely horrible source--and Draper's connections on Wall
Street and abroad. Draper's son and heir, <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> H. <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> III,
was co-chairman for finance(chief of fundraising) of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>-for-President national campaign organization in 1980. With
<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> in the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>, the younger <ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> heads up the
depopulation activities of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> Nations throughout the
world.
<ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> was vice president of <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent> Read until 1953. During
the 1950s and 1960s, the chief executive there was Frederic
Brandi, the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> who was Draper's co-director for the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
investments and his personal contact man with the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> Steel
Trust. <ent type='PERSON'>Nicholas Brady</ent> was Brandi's partner from 1954, and
replaced him as the firm's chief executive in 1971. Nicholas
Brady, who knows where all the bodies are buried, was chairman of
his friend <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>'s 1980 election campaign in <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent>,
and has been <ent type='GPE'>United</ent> States <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent> Secretary throughout Bush's
presidency.s3s3</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and Grey</p>

<p> The U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> for <ent type='ORG'>International Development</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>USAID</ent>) says
that surgical sterilization is the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> administration's "first
choice" method of population reduction in <ent type='EVENT'>the Third World</ent>.s3s4
<ent type='ORG'>The United</ent> Nations Population Fund claims that 37 percent of
contraception users in Ibero-<ent type='GPE'>America</ent> and the <ent type='LOC'>Caribbean</ent> have
already been surgically sterilized. In a 1991 report, <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> H.
<ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent> III's U.N. agency asserts that 254 million couples will be
surgically sterilized over the course of the 1990s; and that if
present trends continue, 80 percent of the women in <ent type='GPE'>Puerto Rico</ent>
and <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent> will be surgically sterilized.s3s5
The U.S. government pays directly for these sterilizations.
<ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent> is first among targeted nations, on a list which was
drawn up in July 1991, at a <ent type='ORG'>USAID</ent> strategy session. India and
<ent type='GPE'>Brazil</ent> are second and third priorities, respectively.
On contract with the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> administration, U.S. personnel are
working from bases in <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent> to perform surgery on millions of
<ent type='NORP'>Mexican</ent> men and women. The acknowledged strategy in this program
is to sterilize those young adults who have not already completed
their families.
<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> has a rather deep-seated personal feeling about
this project, in particular as it pits him against Pope <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Paul</ent>
II in <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> countries such as <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>. (See Chapter 4 below, on
the origin of a <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>-family grudge in this regard.)
The spending for birth control in the non-white countries is
one of the few items that is headed upwards in the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
administration budget. As its 1992 budget was being set, <ent type='ORG'>USAID</ent>
said its <ent type='ORG'>Population Account</ent> would receive $300 million, a 20
percent increase over the previous year. Within this project, a
significant sum is spent on political and psychological
manipulations of target nations, and rather blatant subversion of
their religions and governments.s3s6
These activities might be expected to cause serious objections
from the victimized nationalities, or from U. S. taxpayers,
especially if the program is somehow given widespread publicity.
Quite aside from moral considerations, {legal} questions would
naturally arise, which could be summed up: {How does <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>
think he can get away with this?}
In this matter the President has expert advice. Mr.
(Clayland) Boyden <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> has been counsel to <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> since the
1980 election. As chief legal officer in the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>, Boyden
<ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> can walk the President through the dangers and complexities
of waging such unusual warfare against Third World populations.
<ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> knows how these things are done.
When Boyden <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> was four and five years old, his father
organized the pilot project for the present worldwide
sterilization program, from the <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> family household in <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent>
Carolina.
It started in 1946. The eugenics movement was looking fora
way to begin again in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>.
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> death camps such as <ent type='ORG'>Auschwitz</ent> had just then seared the
conscience of the world. <ent type='ORG'>The Sterilization League</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>,
which had changed its name during the war to "Birthright,
Inc.," wanted to start up again. First they had to overcome
public nervousness about crackpots proposing to eliminate
"inferior" and "defective"people. The <ent type='PERSON'>Leaguetried</ent> to
surface in <ent type='GPE'>Iowa</ent>, but had to back off because of negative
publicity: a little boy had recently been sterilized there and
had died from the operation.
They decided on <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Carolina, where the <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> family could
play the perfect host.s3s7 Through <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> imperial contacts,
Boyden Gray's grandfather Bowman <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> had become principal owner
of the R.J. <ent type='PERSON'>Reynolds</ent> Tobacco Co. Boyden's father, <ent type='PERSON'>Gordon</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent>,
had recently founded the Bowman <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> (memorial) Medical School in
Winston-Salem, using his inherited cigarette stock shares. The
medical school was already a eugenics center.
As the experiment began, <ent type='PERSON'>Gordon</ent> Gray's great aunt, <ent type='PERSON'>Alice</ent>
Shelton <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent>,who had raised him from childhood, was living in
his household. Aunt <ent type='PERSON'>Alice</ent> had founded the "Human Betterment
League," the <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Carolina branch of the national eugenical
sterilization movement.
Aunt <ent type='PERSON'>Alice</ent> was the official supervisor of the 1946-47
experiment. <ent type='ORG'>Working</ent> under Miss <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> was Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Claude Nash Herndon</ent>,
whom <ent type='PERSON'>Gordon</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> had made assistant professor of "medical
genetics" at Bowman <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> medical school.
Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Clarence Gamble</ent>, heir to the Proctor and Gamble soap
fortune, was the sterilizers' national field operations chief.
The experiment worked as follows.{All children enrolled in
the school district of Winston-Salem, N.C., were given a special
"intelligence test." Those children who scored below a certain
arbitrary low mark were then cut open and surgically sterilized.}
We quote now from the official story of the project: "In
Winston-Salem and in [nearby] <ent type='GPE'>Orange County</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Carolina, the
[<ent type='ORG'>Sterilization League</ent>'s] field committee had participated in
testing projects to identify school age children who should be
considered for sterilization. The project in <ent type='GPE'>Orange County</ent> was
conducted by <ent type='ORG'>the University</ent> of <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Carolina and was financed by
a 'Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Hanes</ent>,' a friend of <ent type='PERSON'>Clarence Gamble</ent> and supporter of the
field work project in <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Carolina. The Winston-Salem project
was also financed by <ent type='PERSON'>Hanes</ent>. ["<ent type='PERSON'>Hanes</ent>" was underwear mogul James
<ent type='PERSON'>Gordon</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Hanes</ent>, a trustee of Bowman <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> Medical School and
treasurer of <ent type='PERSON'>Alice</ent> Gray's group]....
"The medical school had a long history of interest in
eugenics and had compiled extensive histories of families
carrying inheritable disease. In 1946, Dr. C. Nash Herndon ...
made a statement to the press on the use of sterilization to
prevent the spread of inheritable diseases....
"The first step after giving the mental tests to grade school
children was to interpret and make public the results. In Orange
County the results indicated that three percent of the school age
children were either insane or feeble-minded.... [Then] the field
committee hired a social worker to review each case ... and to
present any cases in which sterilization was indicated to the
State Eugenics <ent type='ORG'>Board</ent>, which under <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Carolina law had the
authority to order sterilization...."
Race science experimenter Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Claude Nash Herndon</ent> provided
more details in an interview in 1990:s3s8
"<ent type='PERSON'>Alice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> was the general supervisor of the project. She
and <ent type='PERSON'>Hanes</ent> sent out letters promoting the program to the
commissioners of all 100 counties in <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Carolina.... What did
I do? Nothing besides riding herd on the whole thing! The
social workers operated out of my office. I was at the time also
director of outpatient services at <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Carolina Baptist
Hospital. We would see the [targeted] parents and children
there.... I.Q. tests were run on all the children in the
Winston-Salem public school system. Only the ones who scored
really low [were targeted for sterilization], the real bottom of
the barrel, like below 70.
"Did we do sterilizations on young children? Yes. This was a
relatively minor operation.... It was usually not until the
child was eight or ten years old. For the boys, you just make an
incision and tie the tube.... We more often performed the
operation on girls than with boys. Of course, you have to cut
open the abdomen, but again, it is relatively minor."
Dr. Herndon remarked coolly that "we had a very good
relationship with the press" for the project. This is not
surprising, since <ent type='PERSON'>Gordon</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> owned the {Winston-Salem Journal,}
the {<ent type='GPE'>Twin City</ent> Sentinel,} and radio station WSJS.
In 1950 and 1951, <ent type='PERSON'>John Foster</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>, then chairman of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation, led <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> D. <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> III on a series
of world tours, focusing on the need to stop the expansion of the
non-white populations. In November 1952, <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
set up the <ent type='ORG'>Population Council</ent>, with tens of millions of dollars
from the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> family.
At that point, the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Eugenics <ent type='ORG'>Society</ent>, still cautious
from the recent bad publicity vis-a-vis <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>, left its old
headquarters at <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> University. The <ent type='ORG'>Society</ent> moved its
headquarters into the office of the <ent type='ORG'>Population Council</ent>, and the
two groups melded together. The long-time secretary of the
Eugenics <ent type='ORG'>Society</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Frederick</ent> Osborne, became the first president
of the <ent type='ORG'>Population Council</ent>. The <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> family's child-sterilizer,
Dr. C. Nash Herndon, became president of the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Eugenics
<ent type='ORG'>Society</ent> in 1953, as its work expanded under <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
patronage.
Meanwhile, the International <ent type='ORG'>Planned Parenthood</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Fed</ent>eration was
founded in <ent type='GPE'>London</ent>, in the offices of the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> Eugenics
<ent type='ORG'>Society</ent>.
The undead enemy from <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent> II, renamed "Population
Control," had now been revived.
<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> was U.S. ambassador to <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> Nations in 1972,
when with prodding from <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and his friends, <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States
<ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> for <ent type='ORG'>International Development</ent> first made an official
contract with the old <ent type='ORG'>Sterilization League</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. The league
had changed its name twice again,and was now called the
"Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception."The U.S.
government began paying the old fascist group to sterilize
non-whites in foreign countries.
The <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> family experiment had succeeded.
In 1988, the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> for <ent type='ORG'>International Development</ent> signed
its latest contract with the old <ent type='ORG'>Sterilization League</ent> (a.k.a.
"Association for Voluntary Sterilization"), committing the
U.S. government to spend $80 million over five years.
Having gotten away with sterilizing several hundred <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent>
Carolina school children, "not usually less than eight to ten
years old," the identical group is now authorized by President
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> to do it to 58 countries in <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>, <ent type='LOC'>Africa</ent>, and Ibero-<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>.
The group modestly claims it has directly sterilized only2
million people, with87 percent of the bill paid by U.S.
taxpayers.
Meanwhile, Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Clarence Gamble</ent>, Boyden Gray's favorite soap
manufacturer, formed his own "<ent type='ORG'>Pathfinder Fund</ent>" as a split-off
from the <ent type='ORG'>Sterilization League</ent>. Gamble’s <ent type='ORG'>Pathfinder Fund</ent>, with
additional millions from <ent type='ORG'>USAID</ent>, concentrates on penetration of
local social groups in the non-white countries, to break down
psychological resistance to the surgical sterilization teams.</p>

I will be only too glad to put you in touch with the

suggestions which will keep the expenses to a minimum. I have

<p> January 23, 1932
Dear Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>:
Thank you very much for your kind letter of January 21st and
the action you took which has resulted at once in a letter from
Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Emil Lederer</ent>. This letter will serve as a starting point for
correspondence, which I hope will enable more of our <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>
colleagues to come to <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> on the occasion of the congresses
of eugenics and genetics, than otherwise.</p>

The battle cry of <ent type='EVENT'>the New</ent> Order was sounded in 1935with the
publication of {Man the Unknown,} by Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Alexis Carrel</ent> of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> Institute in <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent>. This Nobel Prize-winner said
"enormous sums are now required to maintain prisons and insane
asylums.... Why do we preserve these useless and harmful
beings? This fact must be squarely faced. Why should society
not dispose of the criminals and the insane in a more economical
manner? ... The community must be protected against troublesome
and dangerouselements.... Perhaps prisons should be
abolished.... The conditioning of the petty criminal with the
whip, or some more scientific procedure, followed by a short stay
in hospital, would probably suffice to insure order. [Criminals,
including those] who have ... misled the public on important
matters, should be humanely and economically disposed of in small
euthanasic institutions supplied with proper gases. A similar
treatment could be advantageously applied to the insane, guilty
of criminal acts."
<ent type='ORG'>Carrel</ent> claimed to have transplanted the head of a dog to
another dog and kept it alive for quite some time.</p>

<p>September 5, 1944</p>

<p>The Honorable W. A. <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Ambassador to the U.S.S.R.
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Embassy, <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent></p>

<p>Dear <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent>:</p>

<p> Thinking that possibly Bullitt's article in the recent issue
of "LIFE" may not have come to your attention, I have clipped
it and am sending it to you, feeling that it will interest you.
At present writing all is well here.</p>

<p>With warm regards, I am, Sincerely yours,</p>

<p> Pres</p>

<p> 'At present writing all is well here." Thus the ambassador to
<ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> was reassured by the managing partner of his firm,
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>. Only 22 and a half months before, the U.S.
government had seized and shut down <ent type='ORG'>the Union</ent> Banking
Corporation, which had been operated on behalf of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y by
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>s. But that was behind them now, and they
were safe. There would be no publicity on the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
sponsorship of <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>ism.
Prescott's son <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>, the future U.S. President, was also
safe. Three days before this note to <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent> was written, <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> had parachuted from a <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> bomber airplane over the <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent>
Ocean, killing his two crew members when the unpiloted plane
crashed.
Five months later, in February 1945, Prescott's boss <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> escorted President <ent type='PERSON'>Franklin Roosevelt</ent> to the fateful
summit meeting with <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> leader <ent type='PERSON'>Joseph</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Stalin</ent> at <ent type='GPE'>Yalta</ent>. In
April <ent type='PERSON'>Roosevelt</ent> died. The agreement reached at <ent type='GPE'>Yalta</ent>, calling
for free elections in <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent> once the war ended, was never
enforced.
Over the next eight years (1945 through 1952), <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
was Harriman'sanchorin the <ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> financial world. The
increasingly powerful Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> and his allies gave <ent type='LOC'>East</ent>ern
Europe over to <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> dictatorship. A <ent type='EVENT'>Cold War</ent> was then
undertaken, to "counterbalance" the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>s.
This <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>-inspired strategy paid several nightmarish
dividends. <ent type='LOC'>East</ent>ern Europe was to remain enslaved. <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y was
"permanently" divided. Anglo-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> power was jointly
exercised over the non-<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> "Free World." The confidential
functions of the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> governments were merged.
The <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> clique took possession of the U.S. national security
apparatus, and in doing so, they opened the gate and let the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>

<p> Following his services to <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y's <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> Party, <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> spent several years mediating between the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>,
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>, and <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> governments in the war to stop the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s. He
was ambassador to <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent> from 1943 to 1946.</p>

<p> President <ent type='PERSON'>Harry Truman</ent>, whom <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> and his friends held in
amused contempt, appointed <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> U.S. ambassador to <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>
in 1946.
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> was at lunch with former <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> Prime Minister
Winston <ent type='ORG'>Churchill</ent> one day in 1946,when <ent type='PERSON'>Truman</ent> telephoned.
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> asked <ent type='ORG'>Churchill</ent> if he should accept Truman's offer to
come back to the U.S. as Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent>. According to
Harriman's account, <ent type='ORG'>Churchill</ent> told him: "Absolutely. The center
of power is in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>."s1</p>

<p> <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent> Island</p>

<p> The reorganization of the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> government after <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent>
II--the creation of the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Central Intelligence</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> along
<ent type='NORP'>British</ent> lines, for example--had devastating consequences. We are
concerned here with only certain aspects of that overall
transformation, those matters of policy and family which gave
shape to the life and mind of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>, and gave him access to
power.
It was in these postwar years that <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> attended <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent>
University, and was inducted into the <ent type='ORG'>Skull</ent> and Bones society.
The <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> family's home at that time was in <ent type='GPE'>Greenwich</ent>,
Connecticut. But it was just then that George's parents, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent>
and <ent type='PERSON'>Dorothy</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, were wintering in a peculiar spot in
<ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>, a place that is excluded from mention in literature
originating from <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> circles.
Certain national news accounts early in 1991 featured the
observations on President Bush's childhood by his elderly mother
<ent type='PERSON'>Dorothy</ent>. She was said to be a resident of <ent type='LOC'>Hobe Sound</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>.
More precisely, the President's mother lived in a hyper-security
arrangement created a half-century earlier by <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>,
adjacent to <ent type='LOC'>Hobe Sound</ent>. Its correct name is <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent> Island.
During his political career, <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> has claimed many
different "home" states, including <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Maine</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Massachusetts</ent>,
and Connecticut. It has not been expedient for him to claim
<ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>, though that state has a vital link to his role in the
world, as we shall see. And <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>'s home base in <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>,
throughout his adult life, has been <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent> Island.
The unique, bizarre setup on <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent> Island began in 1931,
following the merger of W.A. <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> and Co. with the
<ent type='NORP'>British</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> firm <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent>.
The reader will recall Mr. Samuel <ent type='PERSON'>Pryor</ent>, the "Merchant of
Death." A partner with the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>s, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>, and <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> boss <ent type='PERSON'>Fritz Thyssen</ent> in banking and shipping
enterprises, Sam <ent type='PERSON'>Pryor</ent> remained executive committee chairman of
<ent type='ORG'>Remington Arms</ent>. In this period, the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> private armies (SA and
SS) were supplied with <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> arms--most likely by <ent type='PERSON'>Pryor</ent> and
his company--as they moved to overthrow the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> republic.
Such gun-running as an instrument of national policy would later
become notorious in the "<ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>-Contra" affair.
Sam Pryor's daughter <ent type='PERSON'>Permelia</ent> married <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> graduate <ent type='PERSON'>Joseph</ent> V.
<ent type='PERSON'>Reed</ent> on the last day of 1927. <ent type='PERSON'>Reed</ent> immediately went to work for
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>, as an apprentice at W.A.
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> and Co.
During <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent> II, <ent type='PERSON'>Joseph</ent> V. <ent type='PERSON'>Reed</ent> had served in the
"special services" section of the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> Signal Corps. A
specialist insecurity, codes and espionage, <ent type='PERSON'>Reed</ent> later wrote a
book entitled {Fun with Cryptograms}.s2</p>

<p> Sam <ent type='PERSON'>Pryor</ent> had had property around <ent type='LOC'>Hobe Sound</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>, for
some time. In 1931, <ent type='PERSON'>Joseph</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Permelia</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Pryor</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Reed</ent> bought the
entirety of <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent> Island.
This is atypically beautiful <ent type='LOC'>Atlantic</ent> coast"barrier
island," a half-mile wide and nine miles long. The middle of
<ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent> Island lies just off <ent type='LOC'>Hobe Sound</ent>. The south bridge
connects the island with the town of <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent>, to the north of
Palm <ent type='PERSON'>Beach</ent>. It is about 90 minutes by auto from <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent>--today,a
few minutes by helicopter.
Early in 1991, a newspaper reporter asked a friend of the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
family about security arrangements on <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent> Island. He
responded, "If you called up the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>,would they tell
you how many security people they had? It's not that <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent>
Island is the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>, although he [<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>] does come
down frequently."
But for several decades before <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was President, <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent>
Island had an ordinance requiring the registration and
fingerprinting of all housekeepers, gardeners, and other
non-residents working on the island. The <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent> Island police
department says that there are sensors in the two main roads that
can track every automobile on the island. If a car stops in the
street, the police will be there within one or two minutes.
<ent type='ORG'>Surveillance</ent> is a duty of all employees of the Town of <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent>
Island. News reporters are to be prevented from visiting the
island.s3
To create this astonishing private club, <ent type='PERSON'>Joseph</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Permelia</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Pryor</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Reed</ent> sold land only to those who would fit in. <ent type='PERSON'>Permelia</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Reed</ent> was still the grande dame of the island when <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> was
inaugurated President in 1989. In recognition of the fact that
the <ent type='PERSON'>Reed</ent>s know where {all} the bodies are buried, President <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
appointed Permelia's son, <ent type='PERSON'>Joseph</ent> V. <ent type='PERSON'>Reed</ent>, Jr., chief of protocol
for the U.S. State Dept., in charge of private arrangements with
foreign dignitaries.
<ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> made <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent> Island a staging ground for his
1940s takeover of the U.S. national security apparatus. It was
in that connection that the island became possibly the most
secretive private place in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>.
Let us briefly survey the neighborhood, back then in 1946-48,
to see some of the uses various of the residents had for the
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> clique.</p>

<p> Residence on <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent> Island</p>

<p> sb|<ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent> Islander {<ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> A. <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent>,}s4, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> Bush's
partner at <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>, had been Assistant Secretary
of War for Air from 1941 to 1945. <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent> was the leading <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>
advocate of the policy of terror-bombing of civilians. He
organized the Strategic Bombing Survey, carried out for the
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> governments by the staff of the <ent type='ORG'>Prudential</ent>
Insurance Company, guided by London's Tavistock Psychiatric
Clinic.
In the postwar period, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was associated with
<ent type='ORG'>Prudential Insurance</ent>,one of Lovett's intelligence channels to
the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> secret services. <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> was listed by <ent type='ORG'>Prudential</ent>
as a director of the company for about two years in the early
1950s.
Their Strategic Bombing Survey failed to demonstrate any real
military advantage accruing from such outrages as the
fire-bombing of <ent type='GPE'>Dresden</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y. But the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>ites
nevertheless persisted in the advocacy of terror from the air.
They glorified this as "psychological warfare," a part of the
utopian military doctrine opposed to the views of military
traditionalists such as Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent></ent> later advised President Lyndon <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent>son to
terror-bomb <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>. President <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> revived the doctrine
with the bombing of civilian areas in <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>, and the destruction
of <ent type='GPE'>Baghdad</ent>.
On October 22, 1945, Secretary of war <ent type='PERSON'>Robert Patterson</ent> created
the <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>, chaired by <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> A. <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent>, to advise the
government on the post-<ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent> II organization of U.S.
intelligence activities. The existence of this committee was
unknown to the public until an official <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> history was released
from secrecy in 1989. But the CIA's author (who was President
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>’s prep school history teacher; see chapter 5) gives no real
details of the <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent> Committee's functioning, claiming: "The
record of the testimony of the <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>, unfortunately,
was not in the archives of the agency when this account was
written."s5
The CIA's self-history does inform us of the advice that
<ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent> provided to the <ent type='PERSON'>Truman</ent> cabinet, as the official War
Department intelligence proposal.
<ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent> decided that there should be a separate Central
Intelligence <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>. The new agency would "consult"with the
armed forces,but it must be the sole collecting agency in the
field of foreign espionage and counterespionage. The new agency
should have an independent budget, and its appropriations should
be granted by <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> without public hearings.
<ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent> appeared before the Secretaries of State, War, and <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent>
on November 14, 1945. He spoke highly of the FBI's work because
it had "the best personality file in the world." <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent> said
the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> was expert at producing false documents, an art "which
we developed so successfully during the war and at which we
became outstandingly adept." <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent> pressed for a virtual
resumption of the wartime Office of Strategic Services (<ent type='ORG'>OSS</ent>) in a
new <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.
U.S. military traditionalists centered around Gen. Douglas
MacArthur opposed Lovett's proposal. The continuation of the <ent type='ORG'>OSS</ent>
had been attacked at the end of the war on the grounds that the
<ent type='ORG'>OSS</ent> was entirely under <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> control, and that it would
constitute an <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Gestapo.s6 But the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> was established in
1947 according to the prescription of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent></ent>, of <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent>
Island.
sb|{<ent type='PERSON'>Charles Payson</ent>} and his wife, {<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Joan</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Whitney</ent> Payson</ent>,} were
extended family members of Harriman's and business associates of
the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> family.
Joan's aunt, <ent type='PERSON'>Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney</ent>, was a relative of
the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>s. Gertrude's son, <ent type='PERSON'>Cornelius Vanderbilt</ent> ("<ent type='PERSON'>Sonny</ent>")
<ent type='ORG'>Whitney</ent>, long-time chairman of Pan <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Airways (<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> was
a Pan Am director), became assistant secretary of the U.S. Air
Force in 1947. Sonny's wife <ent type='PERSON'>Marie</ent> had divorced him and married
<ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> in 1930. <ent type='PERSON'>Joan</ent> and Sonny's uncle, Air Marshal Sir
<ent type='PERSON'>Thomas Elmhirst</ent>, was director of intelligence for the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> Air
Force from 1945 to 1947.
Joan's brother, <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Hay("Jock") <ent type='ORG'>Whitney</ent>, was to be
ambassador to Great <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent> from 1955 to 1961 ... when it would
be vital for <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> to have such a friend.
<ent type='PERSON'>Joan</ent>’s father, grandfather, and uncle were members of the <ent type='ORG'>Skull</ent>
and Bones secret society.
<ent type='PERSON'>Charles Payson</ent> organized a uranium refinery in 1948. Later, he
was chairman of <ent type='ORG'>Vitro Corporation</ent>,makers of parts for
submarine-launched ballistic missiles, equipment for frequency
surveillance and torpedo guidance, and other subsurface
weaponry.
Naval warfare has long been a preoccupation of the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>
Empire. <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> penetration of the U.S. Naval Intelligence
service has been particularly heavy since the tenure of Joan's
<ent type='NORP'>Anglophile</ent> grandfather, <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> C. <ent type='ORG'>Whitney</ent>, as secretary of the
<ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> for President <ent type='PERSON'>Grover Cleveland</ent>. This traditional covert
<ent type='NORP'>British</ent> orientation in the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent>, Naval Intelligence and the
<ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent>’s included service, the <ent type='ORG'>Marine Corps</ent>, forms a backdrop to
the career of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>--and to the whole neighborhood on
<ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent> Island. Naval Intelligence maintained direct relations
with gangster boss <ent type='PERSON'>Meyer Lansky</ent> forAnglo-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> political
operations in <ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent> during <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent> II,well before the
establishment of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Lansky</ent> officially moved to <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent> in
1953.s7
sb|{<ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Herbert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent>, Jr.} (<ent type='ORG'>Skull</ent> and Bones, 1927), was
extremely close to his nephew <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>, helping to sponsor his
entry into the oil business in the 1950s. "Uncle <ent type='PERSON'>Herbie</ent>" was
also a partner of <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Joan</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Whitney</ent> Payson</ent> when they co-founded the
<ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> Mets baseball team in 1960. His son, G.H. <ent type='PERSON'>Walker</ent> III,
was a <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> classmate of {<ent type='PERSON'>Nicholas Brady</ent>} and <ent type='PERSON'>Moreau</ent> D. <ent type='PERSON'>Brown</ent>
(<ent type='PERSON'>Thatcher</ent> Brown's grandson), forming what was called the "<ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent>
Mafia" on Wall Street.
sb|{Walter S. <ent type='PERSON'>Carpenter</ent>, Jr.} had been chairman of the finance
committee of the Du Pont Corporation (1930-40).In 1933,
<ent type='PERSON'>Carpenter</ent> oversaw Du Pont's purchase of <ent type='ORG'>Remington Arms</ent> from Sam
<ent type='PERSON'>Pryor</ent> and the <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>s, and led Du Pont into partnership with
the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> company for the manufacture of explosives.
<ent type='PERSON'>Carpenter</ent> became Du Pont's president in 1940. His cartel with the
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s was broken up by the U.S. government. Nevertheless,
<ent type='PERSON'>Carpenter</ent> remained Du Pont's president, as the company’s
technicians participated massively in the <ent type='GPE'>Manhattan</ent> Project to
produce the first atomic bomb. He was chairman of Du Pont from
1948 to 1962, retaining high-level access to U.S. strategic
activities.
Walter <ent type='PERSON'>Carpenter</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> were fellow activists in
the Mental Hygiene <ent type='ORG'>Society</ent>. Originating at <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> University in

patient, former <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent> partner and Bank of <ent type='GPE'>England</ent>

Brigadier <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Rawlings Rees, director of the <ent type='ORG'>Tavistock Clinic</ent>,
chief psychiatrist and psychological warfare expert for the
<ent type='NORP'>British</ent> intelligence services. <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> was a director of the

From the late 1940s, <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent> Island has served as a center for

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Target</ent>: <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent></p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> graduated from <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> in 1948. He soon entered the
family's <ent type='PERSON'>Dresser</ent> oil supply concern in <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>. We shall now
briefly describe the forces that descended on <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C.
during those years when <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, with the assistance of family and
powerful friends, was becoming "established in business on his
own."
From 1948 to 1950, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> Bush's boss <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> was
U.S. "ambassador-at-large" to Europe. He was a non-military
"Theater Commander," the administrator of the
multi-billion-dollar <ent type='PERSON'>Marshall Plan</ent>, participating in all
military/strategic decision-making by the Anglo-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>
alliance.
The U.S. secretary of defense, <ent type='PERSON'>James Forrestal</ent>, had become a
problem to the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>ites. <ent type='PERSON'>Forrestal</ent> had long been an executive
at <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent> Read on Wall Street. But in recent years he had gone
astray. As secretary of the navy in 1944, <ent type='PERSON'>Forrestal</ent> proposed the
racial integration of the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent>. As defense secretary, he pressed
for integration in the armed forces and this eventually became
the U.S. policy.
<ent type='PERSON'>Forrestal</ent> opposed the utopians' strategy of appeasement
coupled with brinkmanship. He was simply opposed to communism.
On March 28, 1949, <ent type='PERSON'>Forrestal</ent> was forced out of office and flown
on an <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> plane to <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>. He was taken to "<ent type='LOC'>Hobe Sound</ent>"
(<ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent> Island), where <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent></ent> and an army psychiatrist
dealt with him.s8
He was flown back to <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, locked in Walter <ent type='PERSON'>Reed</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent>
Hospital and given insulin shock treatments for alleged "mental
exhaustion." He was denied all visitors except his estranged
wife and children--his son had been <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> Harriman's aide in
<ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent>. On May 22, Forrestal's body was found, his bathrobe cord
tied tightly around his neck, after he had plunged from a
sixteenth-story hospital window. The chief psychiatrist called
the death a suicide even before any investigation was started.
The results of the Army's inquest were kept secret. Forrestal's
diaries were published, 80 percent deleted, after a year of
direct government censorship and rewriting.

<ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Korea</ent>n troops invaded <ent type='GPE'>South Korea</ent> in June 1950, after
U.S. Secretary of State <ent type='PERSON'>Dean</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Acheson</ent> (Harriman's very close
friend) publicly specified that <ent type='GPE'>Korea</ent> would not be defended.
With a new war on, <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> came back to serve as President
Truman's adviser, to "oversee national security affairs."
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> replaced <ent type='PERSON'>Clark Clifford</ent>, who had been special counsel
to <ent type='PERSON'>Truman</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Clifford</ent>, however, remained close to <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> and his
partners as they gained more and more power. <ent type='PERSON'>Clifford</ent> later
wrote about his cordial relations with <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>:
"<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> ... had become one of my frequent golfing
partners in the fifties, and I had both liked and respected
him.... <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> had a splendid singing voice,and particularly
loved quartet singing. In the fifties, he organized a quartet
that included my daughter <ent type='PERSON'>Joyce</ent>.... They would sing in
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, and, on occasion, he invited the group to <ent type='LOC'>Hobe Sound</ent>
in <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent> to perform. His son [<ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>], though, had never
struck me as a strong or forceful person. In 1988, he presented
himself successfully to the voters as an outsider--no small trick
for a man whose roots wound through Connecticut, <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> oil,
the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, a patrician background, wealth, and the Vice
Presidency."s9</p>

<p> With <ent type='PERSON'>Forrestal</ent> out of the way,<ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Dean</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Acheson</ent> drove to <ent type='PERSON'>Lee</ent>sburg, <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent>, on July 1, 1950, to hire the
<ent type='NORP'>British</ent>-backed U.S. Gen. <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> C. <ent type='PERSON'>Marshall</ent> as secretary of
defense. At the same time, Prescott's partner, <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent></ent>,
himself became assistant secretary of defense.
<ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Marshall</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>, and <ent type='PERSON'>Acheson</ent> went to work to
unhorse Gen. Douglas MacArthur, commander of U.S. forces in
<ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>. MacArthur kept Wall Street's intelligence agencies away
from his command, and favored real independence for the non-white
nations. <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent> called for MacArthur's firing on March 23, 1951,
citing MacArthur’s insistence on defeating the <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Chinese</ent>
invaders in <ent type='GPE'>Korea</ent>. MacArthur's famous message, that there was
"no substitute for victory," was read in <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> on April 5;
MacArthur was fired on April 10, 1951.
That September, <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Lovett</ent></ent> replaced <ent type='PERSON'>Marshall</ent> as secretary
of defense. Meanwhile, <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> was named director of the Mutual
Security <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>, making him the U.S. chief of the Anglo-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>
military alliance. By now,<ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> was
everything but commander-in-chief.

<p> A central focus of the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> security regime in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>
(1950-53) was the organization of covert operations, and
"psychological warfare." <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>,together with his lawyers
and business partners, <ent type='PERSON'>Allen</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>John Foster</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>, wanted the
government's secret services to conduct extensive propaganda
campaigns and mass-psychology experiments within the U.S.A., and
paramilitary campaigns abroad. This would supposedly ensure a
stable world-wide environment favorable to Anglo-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>
financial and political interests.
The <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> security regime created the Psychological
Strategy <ent type='ORG'>Board</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>PSB</ent>) in 1951. The man appointed director of the
<ent type='ORG'>PSB</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Gordon</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent>, is familiar to the reader as the sponsor of the
child sterilization experiments, carried out by the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>ite
eugenics movement in <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Carolina following <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent> II.
<ent type='PERSON'>Gordon</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> was an avid <ent type='NORP'>Anglophile</ent>, whose father had gotten
controlling ownership of the R.J. <ent type='PERSON'>Reynolds</ent> Tobacco Company
through alliance with the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> Imperial tobacco cartel's U.S.
representatives, the <ent type='PERSON'>Duke</ent> family of <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Carolina. Gordon's
brother, R.J. <ent type='PERSON'>Reynolds</ent> chairman Bowman <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> Jr., was also a naval
intelligence officer, known around <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> as the "founder of
operational intelligence." <ent type='PERSON'>Gordon</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Gray</ent> became a close friend and
political ally of <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>; and Gray's son became for
Prescott's son, <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent>, his lawyer and the shield of his covert
policy.
But President <ent type='PERSON'>Harry Truman</ent>, as malleable as he was,
constituted an obstacle to the covert warriors. An insular
<ent type='GPE'>Missouri</ent> politician vaguely favorable to the U.S. Constitution,
he remained skeptical about secret service activities that
reminded him of the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> Gestapo.
So, "covert operations" could not fully take off without a
change of the <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> regime. And it was with the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>
Party that <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was to get his turn.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> Runs for Senate</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> had made his first attempt to enter national politics
in 1950, as his partners took control of the levers of
governmental power. Remaining in charge of <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>, he ran against Connecticut's <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Benton</ent> for his
seat in the U.S. Senate. (The race was actually for a two-year
unexpired term, left empty by the death of the previous
senator).
In those days, Wisconsin's drunken Senator <ent type='PERSON'>Joseph</ent> R. <ent type='PERSON'>McCarthy</ent>
was making a circus-like crusade against communist influence in
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>McCarthy</ent> attacked liberals and leftists, State
Department personnel, politicians, and <ent type='GPE'>Hollywood</ent> figures. He
generally left unscathed the Wall Street and <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> strategists
who donated <ent type='LOC'>East</ent>ern Europe and <ent type='GPE'>China</ent> to communist
dictatorship--like <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>, their geopolitics was beyond left
and right.
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> had no public ties to the notorious Joe
<ent type='PERSON'>McCarthy</ent>, and appeared to be neutral about his crusade. But the
<ent type='GPE'>Wisconsin</ent> senator had his uses. Joe <ent type='PERSON'>McCarthy</ent> came into
Connecticut three times that year to campaign for <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and
against the <ent type='NORP'>Democrats</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> himself made charges of "<ent type='GPE'>Korea</ent>,
Communism and Corruption" into a slick campaign phrase against
<ent type='PERSON'>Benton</ent>, which then turned up as a national <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> slogan.
The response was disappointing. Only small crowds turned out
to hear Joe <ent type='PERSON'>McCarthy</ent>, and <ent type='PERSON'>Benton</ent> was not hurt. McCarthy's
pro-<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> rally in <ent type='GPE'>New Haven</ent>, in a hall that seated 6000, drew
only 376 people. <ent type='PERSON'>Benton</ent> joked on the radio that "200 of them
were my spies."
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> resigned from the <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Board</ent> of Fellows for his
campaign, and the board published a statement to the effect that
the "<ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> vote" should support <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>--despite the fact that
<ent type='PERSON'>Benton</ent> was a <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> man, and in many ways identical in outlook to
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>. Yale's <ent type='PERSON'>Whiffenpoof</ent> singers appeared regularly for
Prescott's campaign. None of this was particularly effective,
however, with the voting population.s1s0
Then Papa <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> ran into a completely unexpected problem. At
that time, the old <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> eugenics movement was centered at
<ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> University. <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was a <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> trustee, and his former
<ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> partner, Lawrence <ent type='PERSON'>Tighe</ent>, was Yale's
treasurer. In that connection, a slight glimmer of the truth
about the <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>-<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent> firm's <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> activities now made its way
into the campaign.
Not only was the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Eugenics <ent type='ORG'>Society</ent> itself
headquartered at <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent>, but all parts of this undead fascist
movement had a busy home at <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent>. The coercive psychiatry and
sterilization advocates had made the <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent>/<ent type='GPE'>New Haven</ent> Hospital and
<ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> Medical School their laboratories for hands-on practice in
brain surgery and psychological experimentation. And the Birth
Control League was there, which had long trumpeted the need for
eugenical births--fewer births for parents with "inferior"
bloodlines. Prescott's partner <ent type='PERSON'>Tighe</ent> was a Connecticut director
of the league, and the Connecticut league's medical advisor was
the eugenics advocate, Dr. <ent type='ORG'>Winternitz</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> Medical School.
Now in 1950, people who knew something about <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
knew that he had very unsavory roots in the eugenics movement.
There were then, just after the anti-<ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> war,few open
advocates of sterilization of "unfit" or "unnecessary"
people. (That would be revived later, with the help of General
<ent type='ORG'>Draper</ent>and his friend <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent>.) But <ent type='ORG'>the Birth Control League</ent>
was public--just about then it was changing its name to the
euphemistic "<ent type='ORG'>Planned Parenthood</ent>."
Then, very late in the 1950 senatorial campaign, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>
was publicly exposed for being an activist in that section of the
old fascist eugenics movement. <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> lost the election
by about 1000 out of 862000 votes. He and his family blamed
the defeat on the exposeaa. The defeat was burned into the
family's memory, leaving a bitterness and perhaps a desire for
revenge.
In his foreword to a population control propaganda book,
<ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent></ent> wrote about that1950 election: "My own first
awareness of birth control as a public policy issue came with a
jolt in 1950 when my father was running for <ent type='GPE'>United</ent> States Senate
in Connecticut. <ent type='PERSON'>Drew Pearson</ent>, on the <ent type='LOC'>Sunday</ent> before Election day,
'revealed' that my father was involved with Planned
Parenthood.... Many political observers felt a sufficient number
of voters were swayed by his alleged contacts with the birth
controllers to cost him the election...."s1s1
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> gave a graphic description of these events in
his "oral history" interview at <ent type='GPE'>Columbia</ent> University: "In the
1950 campaign, when I ran against <ent type='PERSON'>Benton</ent>, the very last week,
<ent type='PERSON'>Drew Pearson</ent>,famous columnist, was running a radio program at
that time.... In this particular broadcast, just at the end of
our campaign [<ent type='ORG'>Pearson</ent> said]: "I predict that <ent type='PERSON'>Benton</ent> will retain
his seat in <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States Senate, because it has just been
made known that <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, his opponent, is president of the
Birth Control <ent type='ORG'>Society</ent>" or chairman, member of the board of
directors, or something, "of the Birth Control <ent type='ORG'>Society</ent>. In this
country, and of course with Connecticut's heavy <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
population, and its laws against birth control ... this is going
to be too much for <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> to rise above. <ent type='PERSON'>Benton</ent> will be elected.
I predict."
The next <ent type='LOC'>Sunday</ent>, they handed out, at these <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Churches
in <ent type='GPE'>Waterbury</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Torrington</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Bridgeport</ent>, handbills, quoting
<ent type='PERSON'>Drew Pearson</ent>'s statement on the radio about <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, you
see--I predict. Well, my telephone started ringing that <ent type='LOC'>Sunday</ent>
at home, and when I'd answer, or <ent type='PERSON'>Dotty</ent> [Prescott's wife, George's
mother] would answer--"Is this true, what they say about
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>?This can't be true. Is it true?"
She'd say, "No, it isn't true." Of course, it wasn't true.
But you never catchup with a thing like this--the election's
just day after tomorrow, you see? So there's no doubt, in the
estimate of our political leaders, that this one thing cost me
many thousand votes--whether it was 1, 3, 5 or 10 thousand we
don't know, we can't possibly tell, but it was enough. To have
overcome that thousand vote, it would only have had to be 600
switch [sic].
[Mrs. <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> then corrected the timing in <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> Bush's
recollections.]
"I'd forgotten the exact sequence, but that was it.... The
state then--and I think still is--probably about 55 percent
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> population, with all the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> derivation people
[sic],and <ent type='NORP'>Polish</ent> is very heavy, and the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> church is very
dominant here, and the archbishop was death on this birth control
thing. They fought repeal every time it came up in the
legislature, and {we never did get rid of that prohibition until
just a year or two ago,} as I recall it [emphasis added].s1s2</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was defeated, while the other <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>
candidates fared well in Connecticut. He attributed his loss to
the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Church. After all, he had dependable friends in the
news media. The {<ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> Times}loved him for his bland
pleasantness. He just about owned <ent type='ORG'>CBS</ent>. Twenty years earlier,
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> had personally organized the credit to allow
<ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> S. Paley to buy the <ent type='ORG'>CBS</ent> (radio, later television) network
outright. In return, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> was made a director and the
financial leader of <ent type='ORG'>CBS</ent>; Paley himself became a devoted follower
and servitor of <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>.
Well, when he tried again, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> would not leave the
outcome to the blind whims of the public.
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> moved into action in 1952 as a national leader
of the push to give the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> presidential nomination to
Gen. Dwight D. ("<ent type='PERSON'>Ike</ent>") <ent type='PERSON'>Eisenhower</ent>. Among the other team members
were Bush's <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent>-era lawyer <ent type='PERSON'>John Foster</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>, and <ent type='LOC'>Jupiter</ent>
Islander C. Douglas <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent>.
<ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent> and his father were the pivots as the <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>-<ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>
combination readied <ent type='PERSON'>Ike</ent> for the presidency. As a friend put it:
"When the <ent type='PERSON'>Dillon</ent>s ... invited [<ent type='PERSON'>Eisenhower</ent>] to dinner it was to
introduce him to Wall Street bankers and lawyers."s1s3
Ike's higher level backers believed, correctly, that <ent type='PERSON'>Ike</ent> would
not interfere with even the dirtiest of their covert action
programs. The bland, pleasant <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was in from the
beginning: a friend to <ent type='PERSON'>Ike</ent>, and an original backer of his
presidency.
On July 28, 1952, as the election approached, Connecticut's
senior U.S. senator, James O'Brien McMahon, died at the age of
48. (McMahon had been Assistant U.S. Attorney General, in charge
of the <ent type='ORG'>Criminal Division</ent>, from 1935 to 1939. Was there a chance
he might someday speak out about the unpunished <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>-era crimes
of the wealthy and powerful?)
This was {extremely} convenient for <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent>. He got the
<ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> nomination for U.S. senator at a special delegated
meeting, with backing by the <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent>-dominated state party
leadership. Now he would run in a special election for the
suddenly vacant Senate seat. He could expect to be swept into
office, since he would be on the same electoral ticket as the
popular war hero, General <ent type='PERSON'>Ike</ent>. By a technicality, he would
instantly become Connecticut's senior senator, with extra power
in <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>. And the next regularly scheduled senatorial race
would be in 1956 (when McMahon’s term would have ended), so
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> could run again in that presidential election year ...
once again on Ike's coattails!</p>

<p> With this arrangement, things worked out very smoothly. In
Eisenhower's 1952 election victory,<ent type='PERSON'>Ike</ent> won Connecticut by a
margin of 129507 votes out of 1092471. <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> came in
last among the statewide <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>s, but managed to win by
30373out of 1088799, his margin nearly 100000 behind
<ent type='PERSON'>Eisenhower</ent>. He took the traditionally <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> towns.
In Eisenhower's 1956 re-election, <ent type='PERSON'>Ike</ent> won Connecticut by
303036 out of 1114954 votes, the largest presidential margin
in Connecticut's history. <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> managed to win again, by
129544 votes out of 1085206--his margin this time 290082
smaller than Eisenhower's.s1s4
In January 1963, when this electoral strategy had been played
out and his second term expired, <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> retired from
government and returned to <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>.
The 1952 <ent type='PERSON'>Eisenhower</ent> victory made <ent type='PERSON'>John Foster</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> Secretary
of State, and his brother <ent type='PERSON'>Allen</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> head of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>. The
reigning <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> brothers were the "<ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>" replacements for
their client and business partner, "<ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>" <ent type='PERSON'>Averell</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Harriman</ent>. Occasional public posturings aside, their strategic
commitments were identical to his.
Undoubtedly the most important work accomplished by <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> in the new regime was on the golf links.
Those who remember the <ent type='PERSON'>Eisenhower</ent> presidency know that <ent type='PERSON'>Ike</ent>
played ... quite a bit of golf! <ent type='NORP'>Democrats</ent> sneered at him for
mindlessness, <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>s defended him for taking this healthy
recreation. Golf was Ike's ruling passion. And there at his
side was the loyal, bland, pleasant Senator <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, former
president of the U.S. Golf Association, son-in-law of the very
man who had reformulated the rules of the game.
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was <ent type='PERSON'>Dwight Eisenhower</ent>'s favorite golf partner.
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> could reassure <ent type='PERSON'>Ike</ent> about his counselors, allay his
concerns, and monitor his moods. <ent type='PERSON'>Ike</ent> was very grateful to
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent>, who never revealed the President's scores.
The public image of his relationship to the President may be
gleaned from a 1956 newspaper profile of <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> Bush's role in
the party. The {<ent type='ORG'>New York</ent> Times,}which 11 years before had
consciously protected him from public exposure as a <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> banker,
fawned over him in an article entitled, "His Platform:
<ent type='PERSON'>Eisenhower</ent>":"A tall, lean, well-dressed man who looks exactly
like what he is--a wealthy product of <ent type='ORG'>the Ivy League</ent>--is chairman
of the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> Convention's platform committee. As such,
<ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, Connecticut's senior <ent type='GPE'>United</ent> States Senator, has a
difficult task: he has to take one word and expand it to about
5000.
"The one word, of course, is '<ent type='PERSON'>Ike</ent>'--but no party platform
could ever be so simple and direct....
"Thus it is that Senator <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and his fellow committee
members ... find themselves confronted with the job of wrapping
around the name <ent type='PERSON'>Eisenhower</ent> sufficient verbiage to persuade the
public that it is the principles of the party, and not the grin
of the man at the head of it, which makes it worthy of
endorsement in [the] November [election].
"For this task <ent type='PERSON'>Prescott</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, a singularly practical and
direct conservative, may not be entirely fitted. It is likely
that left to his own devices he would simply offer the country
the one word and let it go at that.
"He is ... convinced that this would be enough to do the
trick ... if only the game were played that way.</p>

<p> "Since it is not, he can be expected to preside with dignity,
fairness and dispatch over the sessions that will prepare the
party credo for the 1956 campaign.
"If by chance there should be any conflicts within the
committee ... the Senator's past can offer a clue to his
conduct.
"A former <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> Glee Club and second bass in the All-Time
<ent type='PERSON'>Whiffenpoof</ent>s Quartet,he is ...[called] 'the hottest
close-harmony man at <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> in a span of twenty-five years.'
"Close harmony being a <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> specialty under President
<ent type='PERSON'>Eisenhower</ent>, the hottest close-harmony man at <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> in twenty-five
years would seem to be an ideal choice for the convention job he
holds at <ent type='GPE'>San Francisco</ent>....
"[In addition to his business background,he] also played
golf, competing in a number of tournaments. For eight years he
was a member of the executive committee of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States Golf
Association....
"As a Senator, Connecticut's senior spokesman in the upper
house has followed conservative policies consistent with his
business background.
