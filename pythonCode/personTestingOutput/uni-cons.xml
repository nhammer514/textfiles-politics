Unified Conspiracy Theory - Part 1</p>

<p>Except no substitutes, here is the Unified Field Theory of Conspiracies!</p>

<p>What can you say about a theory that:</p>

<p> Is proposed by a member of the intelligence community who claims to
have seen the documents.</p>

<p> Claims that the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> assassination was not because the military
industrial complex wanted to make money off <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>, but because he was
going to go public with government secrets about <ent type='EVENT'>UFOs</ent>.</p>

<p> Claims that secret treaties exist between our government and aliens from
space.</p>

<p> Claims that much of our high tech stuff is obtained through this treaty.</p>

<p> Claims that the treaty allows aliens to abduct people with government
sanction.</p>

<p> Gives project names of many secret projects associated with the <ent type='EVENT'>UFO</ent>
coverup.</p>

<p> Claims that the real Unified Field Theory is known and is being
suppressed.</p>

<p> Says the aliens, in effect, claim to be God.</p>

<p> Claims that secret <ent type='EVENT'>UFO</ent> projects are partly funded by government drug
smuggling.</p>

<p>What you can say is, if you want conspiracies, except no substitutes! Set
your weirdness bit way past the Twilight Zone, and read on!</p>

<p>WARNING LARGE POST FOLLOWS ###############################################</p>

<p> Fellow computer enthusiasts, 11-24-89</p>

<p> What follows is a transcript of a 45 minute lecture that I attended on 11-17-89 at the "Whole Life Expo." in <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>California</ent>. Speaking was Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Milton William Cooper</ent> who I first
became acquainted with through a text file I downloaded from a
local computer BBS. The file dealt with the subject of UFO's and
our government's concealment of the truth about them in such a
way that it made a lasting impression on me, which is why I
attended his lecture; to learn more. Please forgive my probable
misspelling of some of the proper names in the transcript which
follows and allow that I have taken it as best I could, word-for-word, from a less than acceptable micro-cassette recording.
If you are as moved by what you are about to read as I was in
hearing it first hand, I ask that you please spread it as far
and wide as possible. Upload it to every BBS in your reach and
please, don't change anything. Also, please give considerable
thought to Mr. Cooper's suggestions as to what we all can do to
see that this information is confirmed by our government to make
them stop what they are up to.
Thank you, and now, Milton <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent>:</p>

<p> "For those of you who don't know who I am, I was raised in a
military family. My family, my ancestors, since they came to
this country, have been government people. We have served in the
military, we have been patriots, we have fought in all the wars,
we care about this country and believe in the constitution of
<ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States. We know, as many people don't know, that the
Constitution of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States of America IS <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent>
States of America! And that's why we've always been ready ...to
do the things needed ...to preserve and protect it."
"When I left home I went into <ent type='ORG'>the Air Force</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>the Strategic Air</ent>
Command. As a child I'd heard stories from my father and pilots,
other pilots, my father was a pilot, about Foo Fighters, UFO's,
strange craft that were not made on this <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent>. And as a kid,
you hear that in passing, and it's neat, and you giggle about
it, and you go out and play "Space Man", and you forget it."
"When I was in <ent type='ORG'>the Air Force</ent> I met men who had participated in
alien crashed-craft recoveries. Now this intrigued me, it interested me, but it was usually after quite a few bottles of
beer that these stories would come out, and sometimes the next
morning I couldn't remember what the heck the guy said."
"When I left <ent type='ORG'>the Air Force</ent> I went into the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent>, and this is
where everything began to happen for me. I had originally intended to just go from service to service and do something that
very few people have ever done before. I was a very adventurous,
very crazy ...young man, and I thought that that would be a
pretty exciting life. I volunteered for submarines, and while on
the submarine U.S.S. Tyroot, SS-416, on a transit between the
<ent type='GPE'>Portland</ent>/<ent type='GPE'>Seattle</ent> area and Pearl Harbor, which was our home port;
the Pearl Harbor sub base, as the port lookout I saw a craft,
saucer-shaped, the size of a <ent type='ORG'>Midway</ent> class carrier, aircraft
carrier, for those of you who don't know how big that is; it's
huge, come up out of the water approximately 2 1/2 nautical
miles off the port bow, which is about 45 degrees to the left of
the pointy end of the submarine. It tumbled slowly on its own
axis, and went up into the clouds. It appeared to be moving
slowly to me at a distance of 2 1/2 nautical miles, but in
reality it was moving pretty fast because it came up out of the
water, did a few tumbles and it was gone!"
"I then reported it to the officer of the deck. I didn't tell
him what it was that I saw because my Daddy didn't raise no
fools and in case nobody else saw it I didn't want to be the
only looney onboard the ship. So I asked the officer of the deck
to help me cover that area, and he did, which is common for officers and lookouts to help each other while on bridge watch because they all hang together if something bad happens. After a
few seconds of watching, the same craft, or another craft exactly like it, came down out of the clouds, tumbled again on its
own axis, and went into the water. Ensign <ent type='PERSON'>Ball</ent>, who was the officer of the deck, was literally shocked! What could I say? <ent type='PERSON'>Seaman Dejeralimo</ent>, who was the starboard lookout, had also witnessed this, and ensign <ent type='PERSON'>Ball</ent> called the captain to the bridge who
was followed by the chief quartermaster who brought a 35MM camera, and we watched for between 7 and 10 minutes the same craft,
or different craft that looked exactly alike, enter and leave
the water. It was an incredible show. I don't know if they knew
we were there, or if they even cared, but the craft did not
glow, they were metal, they were machines without a doubt, they
were obviously intelligently guided, they were HUGE, and having
been in <ent type='ORG'>the Air Force</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> and knowing what it takes, I
knew without a doubt, and know it today, that that machine was
not made on the face of this <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent>. Because there's nothing that
man can make, that can fly through the air at a speed like that,
tumble on its own axis, and enter the water and effectively fly
beneath the sea."
"If you've ever been aboard an airplane and then gone aboard a
submarine, I know there's probably some of you in this room who
have visited a submarine at one time or another, you can readily
see just without even any of the technicalities involved how
difficult such a thing would be to do. Where would it be built,
that size? It was absolutely incredible. It changed my life
because then all the stories that I'd heard all my life I knew
were true, and I began seeing the world in a different light."
"It wasn't long after that I was trained by Naval security in
intelligence. I was sent to <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>. I was assigned as a patrol
boat captain, first in DaNang harbor, given a crew, given a
multi-million dollar patrol boat. My job was to gather intelligence from the people who lived around the harbor and the
fishermen who transited the harbor, and maintain the safety and
security of the harbor and the shipping. After about 5-months I
was sent up <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> to the <ent type='LOC'>DMZ</ent>, to a place called <ent type='PERSON'>Qua Vieaf</ent> [sp],
on the <ent type='NORP'>Tacan</ent> [sp] river. Our base camp was at the river mouth.
We were only 3-miles <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> of the <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>ese border and
our job was to patrol the <ent type='NORP'>Tacan</ent> river from the river mouth to
Dang Ha [sp], and then up the Quang Tree [sp] cutoff to Quang
Tree city, again to get to know the people on the bank, gather
intelligence, and to patrol every night and maintain the safety
and security of the river and the river traffic."
"It was while there that I discovered that there was a tremendous amount of <ent type='EVENT'>UFO</ent> and alien activity in <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>. It was always
reported in official messages as 'enemy helicopters.' Now any of
you who know anything about the <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent> war know that the <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>ese did not have any helicopters, especially after our
first couple of air raids into <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>. Even if they had
they would not have been so foolish as to bring them over the
<ent type='LOC'>DMZ</ent> because that would have insured their demise. Our troops
were fired on occasionally by these 'enemy helicopters,' enemy
troops were fired on occasionally by these 'enemy helicopters,'
and occasionally people would disappear. And on one instance
that I know for sure at least one entire village disappeared one
night due to alien activity. The reason they used the term
'enemy helicopters' in messages and dispatches was that in Viet
Nam you could be overrun at any time, no matter where you where.
They did not bring crypto encoding equipment into <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>, I'm
talking about the machinery. What we did is we had crypto tables, and once we every 24-hours those codes would be no good. So
that's what we used. We also, because of the inability to use
crypto transmitting equipment, had to devise code words such as
'enemy helicopters.'"
"When I left <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent> I was eventually attached to the headquarters staff of the Commander in Chief of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States
<ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Fleet at Macalappa, [sp] <ent type='GPE'>Hawaii</ent>, which is a little hill
overlooking Pearl Harbor, it's a beautiful white building up
there, and I was specifically attached to the Intelligence
Briefing Team of the Commander in Chief of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States
<ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Fleet."
"It was during this tour of duty that, in the course of my
duties, documents were placed in my hands that were so unbelievable and so incredible that it took me quite a while to adjust
to the fact that what I was seeing was real. Now for those of
you who don't understand how I could come to see this information let me give you a little short course in security clearance
and "the need to know" and how you get to see classified information if you're in the military or in the government, it doesn't matter which, the rules are the same."
"Number one you need a security clearance, and you've got to
have clearance at the level that the information you want to see
is classified at. In this instance it was classified 'Top Secret, Magic, Restricted Information,' which I came to find out
later is the highest security classification in the Nation. To
get that type of clearance, all you have to have is a Federal
Bureau of Investigation background check, which takes about six
months and they send federal agents to your home, to your old
schools, to all your teachers, to your friends, to everybody you
put down on your security clearance forms, to all your old addresses, your neighbors, everybody that you've worked for, and
it's embarrassing because they don't tell them what they're
checking on. They just show them their identification and start
asking questions and that's when you find out who's your friend
and who's not, because a lot of people get scared and think,
'<ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent> just robbed a bank and I'm not talkin' to him anymore.'"
"Now once you get that it's called a 'B.I.' and for those of
you who have received a copy of my service record look on the
first page, the DD-214 where it says 'Security Clearance,' you
will see the term 'B.I.' That's a 'Bureau of Investigation'
clearance. Now at that point, you have the clearance for everything including Top Secret and above. What determines what you
get to see is your need to know, and the job that you have determines what your need to know is."
"I was assigned to <ent type='ORG'>the Intelligence Briefing Team</ent> of the Commander in Chief of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Fleet, who had to
know everything concerning his area of operations which was one-half of the Earth's surface; the <ent type='NORP'>Indian</ent> ocean, the <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent>
ocean, and all the land masses in between. Believe it or not, if
we go to war, if we ever go to war, it's <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent>
that strikes the first blow and attempts to keep the enemy at
bey while we can get ourselves together, at least historically.
Nuclear weapons have kind of done away with that concept, but
military commanders like to talk about it anyway."
"Because of this, and you have no conception of the amount of
material and information that an area commander has to know,
it's unbelievable, and he has to keep track of this, he has to
keep on top of it. He has to know what's happening, he has to
make the right decisions. Because it's almost humanly impossible
for anyone to do that, they have what's called a briefing team,
and it's our job to make sure that he has the correct information, all the time, on a 24-hour basis. And every morning, between 8 and 9 AM, we would give a briefing which covered everything that happened in the previous 24-hours, and everything
scheduled to happen in the next 24-hours, and all the pertinent
intelligence reports that we had received since the last briefing that he needed to know and that his staff members needed to
know. Occasionally we would get messages marked 'Top Secret,
Magic, Restricted Information,' and it would be coded in such a
way that all you had were answers to questions which you didn't
know what the questions were so you really didn't know what the
message was all about."
"But eventually I found myself in possession, holding two
documents; one called 'Project Grudge,' another one called 'Operation Majority.' Project Grudge contained the history of alien
involvement since around 1936, and it began talking about
Germany's involvement with a crashed-disk that they had recovered in 1936 and were attempting to duplicate the technology.
They were not successful despite what all these <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> hunters
want to tell you. If they had been successful, we would not have
won the war, because you cannot beat those weapons! You cannot
outfly those craft, you can't even think about it with conventional aircraft. If <ent type='GPE'>Germany</ent> had been successful, we would now
have a <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> flag up in front of this podium."
"They did make some headway. When we went into <ent type='LOC'>Punta Mundy</ent>
[sp] we captured documents, we got some scientists, we got some
hardware. The <ent type='NORP'>Russians</ent> also got some documents, some scientists,
and some hardware. It wasn't until 1947 that we were able to
capture a craft, a whole craft, not all together but it was
everything. And that occurred near the city of <ent type='GPE'>Roswell</ent>, New
<ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>. There were dead aliens recovered from the craft. In Project Grudge I saw photographs of these dead aliens, of the
craft, I saw photographs of live aliens, I saw photographs of
autopsies, internal organs, I saw photographs of the alien designated 'E.B.'[or Ebe] which was held in captivity from 1949 until June the 2nd, 1952 when he died. I saw the history of what
they had been able to at that time put together, from incidents
in the 1800's which involved aliens and their craft."
"I saw the names of projects. I saw a project that was to fly
recovered alien craft that had been recovered intact and undamaged, and some of them were recovered intact and undamaged, and
how that happened I have no idea. It was called 'Project Redlight,' and first was conducted from the <ent type='ORG'>Tonopah</ent> test range in
the <ent type='GPE'>Nevada</ent> test sight and then was moved to a specially built
area, ordered built by president <ent type='PERSON'>Eisenhower</ent>, called '<ent type='ORG'>Area</ent>-51,'
code named '<ent type='ORG'>Dreamland</ent>,' in the Groom [sp] dry lake area of the
<ent type='GPE'>Nevada</ent> test sight, by secret executive order. It doesn't exist
officially, if you ask anyone, or if you write letters to the
government they will tell you it doesn't exist. However if you
go out there at several places and see it, fly outside the
boundaries and look down and see it, you know it's there, but
according to the government it doesn't exist."
"The project to fly, test fly these craft, was ongoing until
sometime in 1962 when a craft blew up not far from the test
sight, in the air, and the explosion was seen over a three-state
area. The pilots were killed, they had no idea what had happened
or why the craft blew up, but they put Project Redlight on hold
until a later date when the aliens supplied us with 3-craft and
personnel to help us learn how to fly these craft. That project
is ongoing and we now have not only alien craft that we are flying, we have craft we have built, using the captured technology,
and some of the UFO's that people report seeing in <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent>
States, and maybe even elsewhere, are flown by United States
personnel."
"That may come as a shock to you. We have technology way beyond the limits of what we have been told. A lot of our development technologically, since the end of <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent> II, has been
due to the exchange of technology which occurs in the area
called '<ent type='ORG'>Area</ent>-51' on a regular basis ...ongoing."
"When <ent type='PERSON'>James Oberth</ent>, professor <ent type='PERSON'>Oberth</ent> retired, many of you
don't know who he is ...not too many space people in here. Professor <ent type='PERSON'>Oberth</ent> was probably one of the greatest rocket scientists
and space commentists that ever lived. When he retired, the government gave him a special award, there was a press conference,
all kinds of ceremony, and when he got up to speak he said,
'Gentlemen,' and I quote professor <ent type='PERSON'>Oberth</ent>, he said, 'Gentlemen,
we cannot take credit for all the technological developments
that we have had in the last decade. We have had help,' and
that's where he stopped."
"One of the reporters raised his hand and said, 'Professor
<ent type='PERSON'>Oberth</ent>, can you tell us what other country helped us?'"
"He said, 'It was those little guys from out in space,' and
then he got down and and would not comment any further. Now this
occurred in 1959. I can go on and on but time doesn't allow it."
"I will tell you ladies and gentlemen that there are all kinds
of things going on all the time, we are making rapid progress in
exposing this. Since I have begun talking, people have been coming out of the woodwork at a rapid rate, who know and have
pieces of this puzzle, and are helping us to put it together,
because I don't have all the answers. I saw an awful lot of material, I have remembered an awful lot of it, I have probably,
in my remembering, made some mistakes, and I guarantee you
they're minor ones, if I have."
"We have just recently, for those of you who didn't believe
that <ent type='ORG'>the Jason Society</ent> of the Jason Scholars, the secret group
existed, we now have a letter from the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>, with 51 names
of the Jason Scholars, an admission from the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> that they
hold the highest security clearances in the nation, an admission
from the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> that they hold the protocol rank of Rear Admiral, and are treated as such on any military installation or
in any government office. There are 6 Nobel Prize winners on
that list, there are the elite of the elite of the scientific
world, they are the only ones who really know the truth about
the technology today and about the real science of physics, because the one that we're being taught all the time... If you
send your kids to college to learn physics you're wasting your
money because they're teaching them stuff that doesn't work,
it's not true, it's not real. Gravity is not what we think it
is. There IS a Unified Theory! We already know what it is, it's
what makes these craft work. It's absolutely incredible what's
going on."
"How many of you keep up with <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent>y Goodman's show on <ent type='ORG'>KVEG</ent> out
of <ent type='GPE'>Las Vegas</ent>? For those of you who don't, I would try tuning in
on any night between 10:00 PM and 1:00 AM. It's 840 on your AM
dial, and the subject every night are those subjects that no
other media person in <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States will touch with a 10-foot pole, every single night except Saturday night. It's the
only show that you can call in and talk to another caller,
you've got 3-minutes to say whatever you want to say as long as
you don't cuss or swear or slander anyone, and every night
they're helping to expose this."
"When <ent type='PERSON'>John Lear</ent> and I first said what was going on out at
Groom Lake everybody said, 'You're nuts, there's nothing going
on out at Groom Lake!' The listeners of the <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent>y Goodman radio
show put together an excursion and went up to Groom Lake and
they all, ever since, every night, they go up there and watch
them test fly the alien craft ...every night! The first night
they had 100 people there. And 100 people saw 4 alien craft fly,
doing things that no airplane and no helicopter can do. Now they
don't tell us anymore that there's nothing happening at Groom
Lake. What they tell us now is there's no such thing as aliens,
it's all government secret projects. That's okay because we'll
prove that wrong too eventually, it just takes awhile. Because
where we WERE ...it's not where we're AT, and I'm really happy
about that."
"Now, if you want to see what's happening right now, keep
watching your movies, keep watching your television commercials,
your alien programs on television, read <ent type='PERSON'>Whitley Streeper</ent>'s
'<ent type='ORG'>Majestic</ent>' which is a part of the contingency plan called '<ent type='ORG'>Majestic</ent>' to test the reaction of the population to the presence
of aliens on the <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent>. And I have just finished my study of
<ent type='PERSON'>Whitley Streeper</ent>'s book '<ent type='ORG'>Majestic</ent>,' and I'm gonna tell you right
now that most of the documents in there, that he says are fiction, are real documents that came right out of Project Grudge.
It is part of the government's campaign to leak information out
in ways that they can always deny that it's real. There's only
one thing wrong with the information in that book, the stories
of the characters in there I know nothing about. What I'm talking about are the supposed government documents that he has in
that book. I'm telling you tonight they're real. Those are some
of the same documents that I saw in Project Grudge back between
1970 &amp; 1973, and where we have wondered before, now we know that
<ent type='PERSON'>Whitley Streeper</ent> IS working for the government. And we had a
suspicion anyway because in the front of his book he states that
he got information and was helped by the research team of Moore,
Shanderey, and <ent type='PERSON'>Friedman</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>William Moore</ent> has publicly admitted on
July the 1st that he is an agent of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States Government, and we know that the others are too."
"This is gonna come out, and the reason they're doing it the
way they're doing it is they know eventually you're gonna find
out that it's all true and real. They're desensitizing you so
that you're not shocked, so that there's no collapse of society
as we know it, so that the religious structure doesn't fall to
pieces, so that the stock market doesn't go crazy, because these
were their original fears. Now, there's nothing we can do about
the last one because it's already happened, there will be a segment of the population that worships the aliens, even though
they're no different than us they're just from somewhere else,
and they may look a little different. They are not gods. But
there are already people worshiping the aliens and they predicted this would happen when they slapped the secret stamp all
over all this stuff."
"You know, there's really nothing wrong with what's been happening except for 3 things;" [<ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> forgot to mention the 3rd
thing, or was sidetracked, or included it into the 2nd thing.]
Number one, when they decided to keep it secret they needed to
finance it, they couldn't tell the public so they couldn't tell
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>. They decided to finance it with the sale, importation
and sale, of drugs. Now in the documents that I read, in Operation Majority, it specifically stated that when <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent> was
the president and CEO of <ent type='ORG'>Sapata</ent> [sp] Oil, he, in conjunction
with the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, organized the first large scale drug importation
into this country from <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> and <ent type='LOC'>Central America</ent> by fishing
boat, to the offshore oil platforms of <ent type='ORG'>Sapata</ent> Oil, and then from
there into the beach, thus bypassing all Customs inspections and
law enforcement inspections of any kind. They are still bringing
in drugs, to a limited extent, in this manner. Another manner is
by <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> contract aircraft which, one of their bases of landing is
<ent type='GPE'>Homestead</ent> [sp] Air Force Base in <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>. We have affidavits
from air controllers who have vectored the planes in, who have
made sure that they're not interfered with in any way. We have
affidavits from personnel at <ent type='GPE'>Homestead</ent> Air Force Base who say
the planes have been met by <ent type='PERSON'>Zeb Bush</ent>, who's <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent>'s son.
We have affidavits from people who work in <ent type='LOC'>the Gulf</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>,
in the offshore oil business, that yes indeed, the drugs are
coming in, at least some of them, from the offshore oil platforms."
From the audience came a clear statement, "Just say no?"
"Pardon? ...Right! Just Say No! Well that's what we're gonna
do ladies and gentlemen with your help ...we are going to say
NO, no more! And you gotta do it, you gotta act. You either
gotta act, or watch your country go down the tubes."
"Now, that's one of the things that's wrong. The next thing
that's wrong is, to keep the secret, they killed a lot of people
who tried to leak it out. And if I hadn't done it the way that I
did it, you wouldn't be seeing me anywhere standing or walking
on this <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent> now. They killed president <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> and during the
workshop, for those of you haven't seen the tape, I will show
you, on the tape, who shot the president and why. Between '70
and '73, in Operation Majority it stated verbatim that President
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> ordered MJ-12 to cease the importation and sale of drugs
to the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> people, that he ordered them to implement a plan
to reveal the presence of aliens to the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> people within
the following year. His assassination was ordered by the policy
committee of the <ent type='PERSON'>Vilderbergers</ent>. MJ-12 implemented the plan and
carried it out in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. It involved agents of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, Division-5 of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent>, and the office of Naval
Intelligence. President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was killed by the driver of his
car, his name was <ent type='PERSON'>William Greer</ent>, he used a recoilless, electrically operated, gas-powered assassination pistol that was specially built by the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> to assassinate people at close range. It
fired an explosive pellet which injected a large amount of
shellfish poison into the brain, and that is why, in the documents, it stated that President Kennedy's brain was removed. If
you've studied the case, you will find that indeed his brain
disappeared. The reason for that is so that they would not find
the particles of the exploding pellet or the shellfish poison in
his brain which would have proved conclusively that Lee Harvy
Oswald was NOT the assassin. In fact, <ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvy Oswald</ent> never
fired a shot, he was the patsy."
Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> paused briefly, and a lady in the audience asked
the obvious question, "Why haven't YOU been assassinated?"
"If they were to kill me right now, what would you think?"
<ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> posed.
"That it's the truth," several people chimed.
"I've got 'em right where I want 'em. If they touch me,
everyone who's ever heard me talk is gonna be absolutely enraged
and is gonna know that everything I've said is true. As long as
they don't touch me there's gonna be some of you who are always
gonna be wondering. But eventually we're gonna bring enough
proof out, and if you're here during the workshop you're gonna
see an awful lot of it that's gonna prove to you that it's true.
It's real. And it's happening!"
"Okay, I've tried to cover a lot of stuff, just briefly, because there's no time in 45 minutes to get into anything very
much."
Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> then announced the scheduled workshop session the
following day in which tangible proofs could be seen but regrettably I was unable to attend. He then opened up the floor to
questions and answers.
A muffled question was barely heard coming from the front of
the room which in essence asked, "What about all the people in
the press and others who were in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> and who saw the assassination? Couldn't they tell where the shot came from, why didn't
they come forward? There must have been plenty."
"There was, we know that there was at least 18 who were all
murdered within 2-years of the event. The odds of that happening
are 1 in 300000 trillion," <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> replied.
Again a muffled question, "Why did the DRIVER have to shoot
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>?"
"Because the other fools missed! There were a total of 3-shots
fired at President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>, one hit him in the throat and didn't
kill him and 2 of them hit John Connelly [sp]. The one that was
fired from the grassy knoll hit the president in the throat. The
other 2-shots came from directly behind the limousine, not the
school book depository building, and hit Governor Connelly. Governor Connelly, in intelligence community circles, is known as a
'can do' man, because he took 2-hits and still kept his mouth
shut."
"How is it that the driver, sitting on the front, left-hand
side of the car was able to blow off the right side of Kennedy's
brain when the bullet actually entered in, and it would have
been virtually impossible..." another person asked.
Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> seized the gist of his question and injected, "For
those of you who have been listening to all these talk show
hosts, whose job it is to be a talk show host, and who have not
done any legitimate research into this, if you come to the workshop, I will show you, on the tape, how it was done. You will
see that <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> was, in fact slumped over against <ent type='PERSON'>Jackie</ent>, his
head was turned [this direction], it was very simple, it was
easy and you will see it with your own eyes."
Another muffled, off-mike question from a member of the audience inquiring why no one else had come forward with the information Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> was disseminating, and why those who knew it
had kept it secret for so long was quickly answered, "It hasn't
been, I'm talkin' about it now. <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent> English was talkin' about
it 8-years ago but everybody laughed at <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent> English. John
Lear's been talkin' about it for 3-years and everybody laughed
at him. Now there's so many people have been talkin' about it,
people are startin' to listen and it's about time. Because it's
about time we that we quit being fools, and that's exactly what
they think we are and we prove it to them every day."
Almost all of the questions from the audience were to faint to
hear. The next one dealt with the alien technology and asked in
essence, "Hasn't any one else [other than the government] come
up with the energy technology that the aliens have?" to which
Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> answered, "There's been quite a few people who've
come up with it and they've ALL been stopped, and they'll all
continue to be stopped. Because once you have it you have FREE
ENERGY. Once you have free energy they no longer have power over
you. You understand? That's why they stop it."
Another question asking, "In the film of the assassination
which was examined greatly by experts, why didn't THEY conclude
that Kennedy's driver shot him?", to which <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> asked, "Examined by <ent type='ORG'>WHO</ent> greatly?", and continued, "Most of the film that you
can purchase has that segment cut out, and you can always tell
it by the person running in the background, they'll run up to
here... all of a sudden they'll be down here... running. You
will see in most of the clips that you've ever seen on television, or in the movies, or that you're able to get your hands
on, you'll see <ent type='PERSON'>William Greer</ent> start to turn like this...", then a
muffled comment from the audience, then <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> answered, "That's
because they clipped it out! And on a lot of them, I'll bet you
most of you, every time you've seen the clip on television,
never looked at the driver anyway. If you're really honest with
yourself, and with me, you know your eyes were right on
<ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>."
A woman asked if any of the alien technology was being used in
present-day military equipment and was answered, "Yes, there's a
lot of alien technology contained in the Stealth bomber, that's
right. The Stealth fighter was flying for 10-years before you
even knew it existed."
As the hour drew late another question, more clearly stated,
was asked of Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> by a woman closer to my ears, "Before
you let us all out of here, there's a bunch of us here wondering
what can we all do to help bring this all out?"
A single word, "REVOLT" issued from several listeners simultaneously but <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> responded, "Don't revolt. What you need to
do is what you should have been doing all along. You need to get
involved with your government. The first thing you need to do is
purchase a copy of the Constitution, which I know that most of
you don't have anywhere in your house, and if I were to go
around this room and ask each person what the Constitution says,
most of you couldn't tell me what the Constitution says from
your grocery bill. And that's the truth! And that IS your country! So if you don't know what your Constitution is you're dead
already, so the first thing you do is you get a copy of your
Constitution. The second thing you do is you learn it! The third
thing you do is you start calling your senators and your representatives, and the President of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States and you start
leaning on them, and you tell them, 'Unless you straighten up
the government, and unless we start getting the truth, and I
mean the whole truth, and no more of this baloney, this's the
last job you're ever gonna have, period. And I'll do everything
in my power to make sure that comes true.' And then write them,
frequently, saying the same thing. And then when they're in your
area, in their area offices, take a little delegation and go see
them, and make them understand that they're gonna be living in
poverty because they're not gonna have a job anymore come election day. You see, the secret government may own the executive
branch, but you people, all of us, we own the <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, and the
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> makes the laws, and the <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> can impeach the entire
executive branch! You also have the right to petition the government for a redress of injuries. So you ARE powerful, you've
just forgotten that you're powerful, you've forgotten that that
vote that you haven't been doing every time election comes
around, that vote has abdicated your power. That vote you did
not cast abdicated your power and gave it to those who are
subverting the Constitution and are ruining this country."
A gentleman then asked, "What was traded to the aliens for
their technology?"
"People and animals," replied <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> succinctly.
Another man asked, "Is <ent type='GPE'>the Soviet Union</ent> in on any of this?"
"<ent type='GPE'>The Soviet Union</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States of America have been
close allies since the end of <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent> II and have been closely
participating in the secret space program all this time. The
<ent type='NORP'>Soviets</ent> have the same thing we have, yes. What you see happening
in the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> block right now is not the result of people standing up and saying, 'We want to be free.' It's the result of the
international bankers saying, 'You tear down these barriers, and
you meet the <ent type='LOC'>West</ent> half way, give your people some freedom, the
<ent type='LOC'>West</ent> is gonna take some freedom away from their people so that
we can put together a one-world economic system ...and have all
the power. That's what's happening! If you don't believe it,
stick around and watch it!"
A dubious woman then asked, "Why was the shellfish poison
necessary? A lot of his brain was blown off anyway."
<ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent>: "The shellfish poison? If you go to kill someone, one
thing I've learned, I learned it real good, I learned it especially good when I went to <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>; just 'cause you shoot someone doesn't mean they're gonna die. And if they don't die,
they're gonna be MAD. And if they've got a gun, you're dead. So
you want the first time to be the last time. So if you really
want to to kill somebody you don't play around. If you REALLY
want to kill somebody ...you KILL them, you don't play, you make
sure that when you shoot them, they're dead. That way they can't
hurt you, can't hurt you at all."
Regrettably, the next question was totally unintelligible, I
was thankful however that Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> had a good public address
system to amplify his reply, "The first moon landing was May the
22nd, 1962... or excuse me, that was the first landing on <ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent>.
I'm sorry, May the 22nd, 1962 was the winged probe that used a
hydrozine propeller, flew around approximately 3-orbits and landed on May the 22nd, 1962, was a joint United States / <ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent>
endeavor. The first time that we landed on the moon was sometime
during the ...probably middle 50's, because at the time when
President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> stated that he wanted a man to set foot on the
moon by the end of the decade we already had a base there."
"What about <ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent>?" came another quick question.
"We have a base on <ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent> also," <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> calmly replied.
"When did that happen?"
"I don't know the exact date but I know the project's name, it
was '<ent type='PERSON'>Adam</ent> and Eve'."
"How long have you known about this?"
"Well, I revealed it publicly for the first time on July the
2nd, 1989, and within 3-weeks of the time I revealed it publicly, the government, to get the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> people not to listen to
me, came out and said that they planned to build a base on the
moon and a colony on <ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent>. Now, 3-days previous to my speech,
representatives from <ent type='ORG'>NASA</ent> said, 'We can never have a colony on
<ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent>, it's impossible that there's a colony on <ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent> because <ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent>
is a dead planet.' And it's NOT a dead planet, they've lied to
you about <ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent>."
"My name is <ent type='PERSON'>Dave</ent> [unintelligible], I'm a representative of the
<ent type='ORG'>Crystic</ent> Institute, and I'd like to know why it was that when we
sent a representative down to your home, at your request, you
failed to produce any documentation to substantiate your allegations."
"In the first place it was NOT at my request, I have never
contacted <ent type='ORG'>the Crystic Institute</ent> in my life. I was on the Carol
Hemingway Show, she contacted the <ent type='ORG'>Crystic</ent> institute, she told
<ent type='PERSON'>Daniel Shehan</ent> [sp] that I had just said something about <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> and
drugs on her show. HE called ME and told me he wanted to send an
investigator, in fact he told me to even help the investigator
because he was new at the job, his name was <ent type='PERSON'>Wayne Nelson</ent>, he is
a very good gentleman, he stayed at my house for 2-days, slept
overnight on my couch, I gave him everything I had. I never told
<ent type='PERSON'>Daniel Shehan</ent> that I had any documents and I never told <ent type='PERSON'>Wayne</ent>
Nelson that I had any documents. In fact what I told <ent type='PERSON'>Wayne Nelson</ent>, and I quote, '<ent type='PERSON'>Wayne</ent>, if I did have the documents I couldn't
admit it and I don't know you from <ent type='PERSON'>Adam</ent>, and I don't know Daniel
Shehan from <ent type='PERSON'>Adam</ent> and what makes you think I would give them to
you.' Who am I going to give them to and how quick are they going to disappear, that was my thought. <ent type='PERSON'>Wayne Nelson</ent> also came to
my house with a stack of documents this thick already substantiating the presence of aliens and extraterrestrial craft on this
planet, and they are keeping it a secret, because they're afraid
somebody'll laugh at them and they'll loose their credibility."
"We need some patriots in this country, not people trying to
make a name for themselves, trying to expose some drug runners,
because those are just the bag-men. The real crook is in the
<ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>! And you can tell THAT to <ent type='PERSON'>Daniel Shehan</ent>!"
"Why didn't <ent type='PERSON'>Jackie</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> report [the source of the lethal
shot]?" asked another audience member.
"Who's she gonna tell? The <ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent> just killed her husband and they're assigned to protect the President. Also, who
had her children? The same <ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent> had her children at
the time."
"Wasn't the craft at <ent type='GPE'>Roswell</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>New Mexico</ent> destroyed and all the
aliens killed?" another young man asked.
"All the aliens were dead but the craft was not completely
destroyed, it was severely damaged yes."
On an unrelated note an older gentleman asked, "Does that mean
that 'Alternative-3' is true?"
"Alternative-3 is absolutely true and so is 'Alternative-2'."
Then a man in his late 20's or early 30's raised his hand,
said something I couldn't hear, and was apparently recognized by
Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> who asked him to take the podium and address the audience.
"What I said was that I thanked him [<ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent>] very much for
coming forward and saying something. A lot of my friends out
here know that I was involved in <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States Special Forces, <ent type='EVENT'>UFO</ent> Tracking and Research from the years 1971 to 1975. My
name is <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Murray</ent>, I was based out of the 71st Tac Controll
Flight, McDill Air Force Base, <ent type='GPE'>Tampa</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>. We were 'Mobile
Radar Command,' that was combat and war ready. We could be loaded on aircraft within an hour and many times were taken into
areas [to] set up radar. A lot of times we were set up around
<ent type='ORG'>Egland</ent> [sp] Air Force Base because that's where they have the
'Altered Temperature Weather Control', where they can test various aircraft for their shrinkage and their dimension change during altered temperature. So, you know, I was told to shut up
twice in 1982 and they finally threatened my parents life so I
stayed quiet, and, that's when <ent type='PERSON'>Wendel Stevens</ent> was taken off the
streets... Just like that! And I hid for quite awhile, and decided to come back out when I heard that you're [<ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent>] of such
high rank as you were, and I felt just in saying that your credentials are true, and that what you have to say, everything
you've said here today, I've heard before behind closed doors.
And you've really tied the link for me to the <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> killing.
And there's a few more links that have to go on with the <ent type='GPE'>Columbia</ent> Cartel and the money laundering. I think there's more than
one cartel involved, and they're shutting one of them down so
one can maintain a power, it just seems to be the way it works."
A muffled question then came from someone in the audience
regarding the person referred to as "Colonel <ent type='PERSON'>Stevens</ent>."
"Uh, Colonel <ent type='PERSON'>Stevens</ent> is out of jail now," replied <ent type='PERSON'>Murray</ent> who
was quickly asked another question I couldn't hear to which he
answered, "I sure hope to hell so, he is a wonderful man and I
give him my utmost respect and it was one of the saddest days in
my life to see what happened to him happen to him. But I don't
care what they say about <ent type='PERSON'>Wendel Stevens</ent>, in my heart you can't
discredit that man to me. I don't care who the hell you are. I
won't listen to it, I don't give a shit if he was screwin' babies. You know... that doesn't... he's not that kind of a man, I
don't care what you say, I know him personally."</p>

<p> The lecture was then essentially over. The "Alternative-2 and
-3" that were referred to briefly are, to the best of my knowledge, two government contingency plans and I don't know which
is which, to 1: Declare Martial Law and invalidate the Constitution on the premise that a terrorist group had entered the country with a Nuclear weapon with plans to detonate it in a major
city. All dissidents would be rounded up and placed in concentration camps and the press and media would be nationalized. All
this, if the information becomes public before they want it to
or if the aliens attempt a takeover, and 2: Another contingency
plan to contain or delay the release of this information, the
details of which I am probably wrong about anyway.
My own personal reaction to <ent type='PERSON'>Milton William Cooper</ent>; Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent>
is a man who appears to be in his late fourties, of medium
height and weight, and was dressed casually when I saw him. His
hairline was receding slightly and he carried himself with confidence and purpose. <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent>, as he was called by several in
attendance, is not a professional speaker. His presentation
lacked the polish of repeated deliveries which all the other
lectures I heard during the Expo. had, but what it lacked in
fine tuning was easily made up for in its content. Weather or
not everyone in the audience was convinced of his sincerity I do
not know, but the thunderous peal of applause which exploded as
he concluded the session spoke for me and the majority of those
in attendance. I am convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that
<ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Cooper</ent> believes everything he said, and I'm about as
skeptical as they come.
Please read the attached file written by <ent type='PERSON'>Milton William Cooper</ent>
which describes some of the government operations, projects, and
code names that pertain to the above transcript. Perhaps from
the two documents you can reach your own conclusions as to what
"Alternative-2 and -3 are.</p>

RELEASES, PERIODICALS, AND SPEECHES. INCLUSION IN ANY OTHER
MEDIA REQUIRES MY EXPRESS WRITTEN PERMISSION.

This file contains the absolute true information regarding the
alien presence on earth and the US Government's involvement with
the aliens. This file contains only the information as I saw it
and only my information. It does not contain any information
from any other source.
It was necessary for me to issue the information previous to
this release in a manner which would deceive the Government
until someone was able to independently confirm my identity, my
employment, my service record, my intelligence background, the
identity of the person to which I gave the information in 1972,
his acknowledgment of the information and when it was given to
him, that the information is correct, that I have not seen him
since 1974, and that I have not communicated with him in any
form since 1976. This was necessary because this file is my
death warrant if MJ-12 continues to operate in a manner
consistent with its history.
All in the last paragraph has been independently verified by 2
different people who have no connection with each other. I will
only list one for obvious reasons.

The original information that I first released was not much
MAJI that I was not a threat long enough to have independent
verification of the facts before I risked death. [TRANSMISSION

consider myself a hero. I believe that most of you would do the
same thing if you knew the truth. I gave an oath that I would
uphold and protect the Constitution of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States of
America and I take that oath very seriously. I am doing no more
now than I did when I fought in <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>. I am doing my duty.
Please make copies of this file and send it to your
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>man, your Senator, the Attorney General of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent>

reputable and qualified Doctor of any reputable person's
choosing in order to confirm this information. I will not,
however submit to any test or hypnosis by anyone who is now or
has ever been connected with the Government in any capacity for
obvious reasons.
The following is brief listing of everything that I personally
saw and know from 1972 and does not contain any input from any
other source whatsoever.</p>

<p> MAJESTY was listed as the code word for the President of the
United States for communications concerning this information.
OPERATION MAJORITY is the name of the operation responsible
for every aspect, project, and consequence of alien presence on
earth.
GRUDGE Contains 16 volumes of documented information collected
from the beginning of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States investigation of
<ent type='ORG'>Unidentified Flying Objects</ent> (UFO's) and Identified Alien Crafts
(<ent type='EVENT'>IAC</ent>). The project was funded by <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> confidential funds (non-appropriated) and money from the illicit drug trade.
Participation in the illegal drug trade was justified in that it
would identify and eliminate the weak elements of our society.
The purpose of project GRUDGE was to collect all scientific,
technological, medical and intelligence information from <ent type='EVENT'>UFO</ent>/<ent type='EVENT'>IAC</ent>
sightings and contacts with alien life forms. This orderly file
of collected information has been used to advance <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent>
States Space Program.
MJ-12 is the name of <ent type='ORG'>the secret control group</ent>. President
<ent type='PERSON'>Eisenhower</ent> commissioned a secret society known as THE JASON
SOCIETY (JASON SCHOLARS) to sift through all the facts,
evidence, technology, lies and deception and find the truth of
the alien question. The society was made up of 32 of the most
prominent men in the country in 1972 and the top 12 members were
designated MJ-12. MJ-12 has total control over everything.
They are designated by the codes J-1, J-2, etc all the way
through the members of <ent type='ORG'>the Jason Society</ent>.
The director of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> was appointed J-1 and is the Director
of MJ-12. MJ-12 is responsible only to the President. MJ-12
runs most of the world's illegal drug trade. This was done to
hide funding and thus keep the secret from the <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and the
people of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States. It was justified in that it would
identify and eliminate the weak elements of our society. The
cost of funding the alien connected projects is higher than
anything you can imagine. MJ-12 assassinated President <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>
when he informed them that he was going to tell the public all
the facts of the alien presence. He was killed by the Secret
Service agent driving his car and it is plainly visible in the
film held from public view.
A secret meeting place was constructed for MJ-12 in MARYLAND
and it was described as only accessible by air. It contains
full living, recreational, and other facilities for MJ-12 and
the JASON SOCIETY. It is code named "THE COUNTRY CLUB". Only
those with TOP SECRET/<ent type='ORG'>MAJIC</ent> clearance are allowed to go there.
MAJI is the MAJORITY AGENCY FOR JOINT INTELLIGENCE. All
information, disinformation, and intelligence is gathered and
evaluated by this agency. This agency is responsible for all
disinformation and operates in conjunction with the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>,
and <ent type='ORG'>the Defense Intelligence Agency</ent>. This is a very powerful
organization and all alien projects are under its control. MAJI
is responsible only to MJ-12.
SIGMA is the project which first established communications
with the aliens and is still responsible for communications.
PLATO is the project responsible for Diplomatic relations with
the aliens. This project secured a formal treaty (illegal under
the Constitution) with the aliens. The terms were that the
aliens would give us technology. In return we agreed to keep
their presence on earth a secret, not to interfere in any way
with their actions, and to allow them to abduct humans and
animals. The aliens agreed to furnish MJ-12 with a list of
abductees on a periodic basis.
<ent type='ORG'>MAJIC</ent> is the security classification and clearance of all
alien connected material, projects, and information. <ent type='ORG'>MAJIC</ent>
means MAJI Controlled.
<ent type='ORG'>AQUARIUS</ent> is a project which compiled the history of alien
presence and their interaction with Homo <ent type='ORG'>Sapiens</ent> upon this
planet for the last 25000 years and culminating with the <ent type='NORP'>Basque</ent>
people who live in the mountainous country on the border of
<ent type='GPE'>France</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent> and the <ent type='NORP'>Syrians</ent>.
GARNET is the project responsible for control of all
information and documents regarding this subject and
accountability of the information and documents.
<ent type='ORG'>PLUTO</ent> is a project to evaluate all <ent type='EVENT'>UFO</ent>/ <ent type='EVENT'>IAC</ent> information
pertaining to space telZk{k+9kR [TRANSMISSION GARBLED]
POUNCE is the project formed to recover all downed/ crashed
craft and aliens.
REDLIGHT is the project to test fly recovered alien craft. It
is conducted at AREA 51 (<ent type='LOC'>DREAMLAND</ent>) in <ent type='GPE'>Nevada</ent>. It was aided
when the aliens gave us craft and helped us fly them. The
initial project was somewhat successful in that we flew a
recovered craft but it blew up in the air and the pilots were
killed. The project was suspended at that time until the aliens
agreed to help us.
SNOWBIRD was established as a cover for project REDLIGHT.
Several flying saucer type craft were built using conventional
technology. They were unveiled to the press and flown in front
of the press. The purpose was to explain accidental sightings
or disclosure of REDLIGHT as having been the SNOWBIRD craft.
<ent type='LOC'>LUNA</ent> is the alien base on the far side of the <ent type='LOC'>Moon</ent>. It was
seen and filmed by the <ent type='ORG'>Apollo</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Astronauts</ent>. A base, a mining
operation using very large machines, and the very large alien
craft described in sighting reports as MOTHER SHIPS exist there.
<ent type='ORG'>NRO</ent> is <ent type='ORG'>the National Recon Organization</ent> based at Fort Carson,
<ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent>. It is responsible for security for all alien or alien
craft connected projects.
DELTA is the designation for the specific arm of the <ent type='ORG'>NRO</ent> which
is especially trained and tasked with security of these
projects.
JOSHUA is a project to develop a low frequency pulsed sound
generating weapon. It was said that this weapon would be
effective against the alien craft and beam weapons.
EXCALIBUR is a weapon to destroy the alien underground bases.
It is to be a missile capable of penetrating 1000 meters of
Tuff/hard packed soil such as that found in <ent type='GPE'>New Mexico</ent> with no
operational damage. Missile apogee not to exceed 30000 feet
AGL and impact must not deviate in excess of 50 meters from
designated target. The device will carry a 1 megaton nuclear
warhead.
ALIENS, there were 4 types of aliens mentioned in the papers.
A LARGE NOSED GREY with whom we have the treaty, the GREY
reported in abductee cases that works for the LARGE NOSED GREY,
a blond human like type described as the <ent type='ORG'>NORDIC</ent>, a red haired
human like type called the ORANGE. The home of the aliens were
described as being a star in the Constellation of Orion,
Barnards star, and <ent type='PERSON'>Zeta Riticuli</ent> 1&amp;2. I cannot remember even
under hypnosis which alien belongs to which star.
<ent type='PERSON'>EBE</ent> is the name or designation given to the live alien
captured at the 1949 <ent type='GPE'>Roswell</ent> crash. He died in captivity.
<ent type='PERSON'>KRLL</ent> OR <ent type='PERSON'>KRLL</ent>L OR CRLL OR CRLLL pronounced <ent type='PERSON'>Crill</ent> or <ent type='PERSON'>Krill</ent> was
the hostage left with us at the first <ent type='PERSON'>Holloman</ent> landing as a
pledge that the aliens would carry out their part of the basic
agreement reached during that meeting. <ent type='PERSON'>KRLL</ent> gave us the
foundation of the yellow book which was completed by the guests
at a later date. <ent type='PERSON'>KRLL</ent> became sick and was nursed by Dr. G.
Mendoza who became the expert on alien biology and medicine.
<ent type='PERSON'>KRLL</ent> later died. His information was disseminated under the
pseudonym O.H. Cril or <ent type='PERSON'>Crill</ent>.
GUESTS were aliens exchanged for humans who gave us the
balance of the yellow book. At the time I saw the information
there were only 3 left alive. They were called (P&amp;#'s) Alien
Life Forms. [TRANSMISSION GARBLED]
RELIGION The aliens claim to have created Homo <ent type='ORG'>Sapiens</ent>
through hybridization. The papers said that RH-blood was proof
of this. They further claimed to have created all four major
religions. They showed a hologram of the crucifixion of Christ
which the Government filmed. They claim that <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> was created
by them.
ALIEN BASES exist in the four corners area of <ent type='GPE'>Utah</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>New Mexico</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Nevada</ent>. Six bases were described in the 1972
papers, all on indian reservations and all in the four corners
area. The base near <ent type='ORG'>Dulce</ent> was one of them.
MURDER The documents stated that many military and government
personnel had been terminated (murdered without due process of
law) when they had attempted to reveal the secret.
CRAFT RECOVERIES The documents stated that many craft had
been recovered. The early ones from <ent type='GPE'>Roswell</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>Aztec</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Roswell</ent>
again, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>, and other places.
GENERAL <ent type='PERSON'>DOOLITTLE</ent> made a prediction that one day we would have
to reckon with the aliens and the document stated that it
appeared that General <ent type='PERSON'>Doolittle</ent> was correct.
ABDUCTIONS were occurring long before 1972. The document
stated that humans and animals were being abducted and or
mutilated. Many vanished without a trace. They were taking
sperm and ova samples, tissue, performed surgical operations,
implanted a spherical device 40 to 80 microns in size near the
optic nerve in the brain and all attempts to remove it resulted
in the death of the patient. The document estimated that 1 in
every 40 people had been implanted. This implant was said to
give the aliens total control of that human.</p>

<p> CONTINGENCY PLAN SHOULD THE INFORMATION BECOME PUBLIC OR
SHOULD THE ALIENS ATTEMPT A TAKEOVER.
This plan called for a public announcement that a terrorist
group had entered <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States with an Atomic weapon. It
would be announced that the terrorists planned to detonate the
weapon in a major city. Martial Law would be declared and all
persons with implants would be rounded up along with all
dissidents and would be placed into concentration camps. The
press, radio, and TV would be nationalized and controlled.
Anyone attempting to resist would be arrested or killed.</p>

<p> CONTINGENCY PLAN TO CONTAIN OR DELAY RELEASE OF INFORMATION
This plan called for the use of MAJESTIC TWELVE as a
disinformation ploy to delay and confuse the release of
information should anyone get close to the truth. It was
selected because of the similarity of spelling and the
similarity to MJ-12. It was designed to confuse memory and to
result in a fruitless search for material which did not exist.</p>

<p> SOURCE OF MATERIAL CONTAINED IN THE DOCUMENTS WHICH I SAW
The source of the material was an <ent type='ORG'>ONI</ent> counter-intelligence
operation against MJ-12 in order for the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> to find out the
truth of what was really going on. The <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> (at that time or at
least the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> that I worked for) were not participants in any
of this. The different services and the government conduct this
type of operation against each other all the time. The result
of this operation was that the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> cut themselves in for a
piece of the action (technology) and control of some projects.
As you can see this file is only a little different from my
previous file. Only some names were scrambled previously to
confuse the government long enough for someone to verify that
what I have said is the truth. I have added information in this
file that puts me in absolute danger. I have sent a copy of
this file to people all over the country and will continue to do
so. Please get this file into as many hands as you can and
maybe that will protect me but I doubt it.</p>

<p> HISTORY WILL BE THE JUDGE OF ME AND THIS INFORMATION AND I
HAVE NO FEAR OF THAT JUDGEMENT. I SWEAR THAT THIS INFORMATION
IS TRUE AND CORRECT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE.</p>

<p> I wish to thank all those people who have aided me in reaching
this point and for their patience and understanding. I owe you
all more than I can ever repay.
Finally, it does not matter who is right and who is wrong or
if a project name is in the wrong place. It does not matter who
is working for who or what is really what. It should be obvious
by now that something sinister and terribly wrong is going on
involving the government and the <ent type='EVENT'>UFO</ent> phenomenon. We must all
band together and expose it now. I have done my part in the
best manner that I could. I can add nothing else except my
testimony in <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> or a court of law that what I saw and have
written in this file is true and that I saw it.
Everything in my previous file that does not conflict with
this file is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and
some of it is from sources and research. You may combine the
files to get the entire picture. Throw out only that
information which conflicts with that contained in this file.
There will be no further additions or corrections to this
information either now or in the future. My file is complete
and stands to be judged by history. Sometime in the future the
exact papers that I saw will surface and you will all see this
exact information contained within them.
