--THE TESLA SHIELD--
</p>
<p>
Of particular interest is the hemispherical shell of energy which years
ago was dubbed the "<ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> Shield." </p>

<p> Two scalar hemispherical surfaces are created, using multiple frequency
transmitters and truncated Fourier series expansions. Interference of the two
scalar hemispheres creates a great, glowing hemispherical shell of ordinary
electromagnetic energy. In the shell, the energy density is sufficient to
lift Dirac matter from the Dirac sea of vacuum. The shell is thus filled with
a glowing plasma. </p>

<p> Such a shell may be several hundreds of miles in diameter at the base.
The enormous energy required to form such a defense shell is obtained by a
"scalar power tap" into the molten core of the earth itself as previously
explained. In late April/early May of 1985, 27 such "power taps" were placed
in the earth by the <ent type='NORP'>Soviets</ent>. If each tap is capable of powering 4 to 6 large
scalar EM weapons, then the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> strategic scalar EM arsenal contains over
100 monstrous superweapons capable of generating exothermic explosions,
endothermic explosions, engineering the weather, locating and destroying
underwater submarines, detecting and destroying ballistic missiles shortly
after launch, detecting and destroying long range strategic bombers as soon
as they are airborne, etc. </p>

<p> At any rate, the giant <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> shield is useful against any penetrating
vehicle. If the shell is not so large, its energy density may be very high.
In that case, the intense plasma heating will fuse and even vaporize metallic
bodies. In addition, any vehicle encountering the shell is subjected to an
extremely intense EMP arising everywhere inside its circuitry. EMP shielding
is of no use against the creation of energy throughout the spacetime of the
circuits; such shielding only helps against energy flow through space in the
conventional sense. </p>

<p> Thus the electronics of any vehicle encountering the shield are
instantly dudded, whether or not they are shielded against ordinary
electromagnetic interference (<ent type='ORG'>EMI</ent>). This includes the electronics operating a
nuclear warhead, carried by a re-entry vehicle. Electrically everything
penetrating the shell is totally dudded. Further, explosive materials are
exploded when such an EMP is encountered, and combustible materials are
fiercely consumed or set afire. Ablative shielding suffers an interesting
catastrophe: since energy does not try to "flow into" the shielding but
"arises" everywhere in it simultaneously, "ablation" occurs everywhere
throughout the ablative material, simply exploding it instantly. In addition,
for smaller <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> shells (say of 50 miles in diameter) the energy density is
sufficient to melt or vaporize metals such as missile structures. </p>

<p> With such a <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> shield, there is no need to discriminate true
warhead bearing re-entry vehicles from decoys, chaff, etc. The whole "mess"
entering the shield is simply "cleaned up" and "sterilized" or destroyed. The
shield can take care of ICBMs/IRBMs and their nuclear warheads, strategic
bombers and their nuclear bombs, cruise missiles and their nuclear warheads,
re-entry vehicles and their warheads, decoys, chaff, etc.</p>

<p>--<ent type='ORG'>SARYSHAGAN</ent> DIRECTION-SEPTEMBER 1979--

<ent type='ORG'>The London</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Sunday</ent> Times of 17 August 1980 contained information and a
photo-sketch of incidents fo sighting of the testing of very large <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent>
globes deep within the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union. The sightings were made in <ent type='GPE'>Afghanistan</ent>
by <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> war cameraman <ent type='PERSON'>Nick Downie</ent>. The phenomena seen were in the
direction of the <ent type='GPE'>Saryshagan</ent> Missile Test Range, which -- according to the
U.S. Defense Departments "<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Military Power," 1986 -- contains one or
more large directed energy weapons (DEW's).

Even though <ent type='ORG'>Downie</ent> was seeing the globe of light from a great
distance, it flared silently over the <ent type='NORP'>Hindu</ent> Kush and expanded to subtend an
arc of about 20 degrees, dimming as it expanded. (An arc of 20 degrees
subtended by an object many hundreds of miles distant indicates an object of
well over a hundred miles in diameter. This gives some idea of the enormous
energy being controlled and manipulated by these <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> weapons.) </p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Downie</ent> saw the sight on more than one occasion in September 1979.</p>

<p> In the same month --December 1979-- a stationary luminous globe
containing a vertical stripe of black in the center was seen in the sky off
the coast of St.<ent type='GPE'>Petersburg</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>. This particular type of sighting in that
area has been previously correlated with times of known activity at
<ent type='GPE'>Saryshagan</ent>. </p>

<p> Further, in the same month, U.S. nuclear warning <ent type='PERSON'>Vela</ent> satellites
detected a "nuclear flash" over the <ent type='LOC'>South Atlantic</ent>, off the coast of <ent type='LOC'>Africa</ent>.
Controversy has raged in U.S. Intelligence and scientific circles to this day
as to whether a nuclear explosion or some other kind of mechanism produced
the flash. </p>

<p> Indeed, the flash may have been produced by a scalar EM howitzer from
<ent type='GPE'>Saryshagan</ent> as one more "ping" of the U.S. Intelligence system, to ascertain
whether or not it knew anything about scalar EM howitzers. Again the negative
response told them with high confidence that (1) We still didn't know about
scalar EM stuff, and (2) We were still totally defenseless against the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>
scalar EM weaponry. </p>

<p> At any rate, from Downie's sightings, it is highly probable that the
<ent type='ORG'>DEW</ent> weaponry at <ent type='GPE'>Saryshagan</ent> Missile Test Range was active in September 1979,
and was producing large <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> globes. If the <ent type='ORG'>DEW</ent>s at <ent type='GPE'>Saryshagan</ent> can produce
the giant luminous <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> globe, they are almost certainly scalar EM
interferometers and can produce the giant <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> shields as well. <ent type='ORG'>Downie</ent>
reported other earlier sightings of similar phenomena seen by <ent type='NORP'>Afghans</ent> deep
within the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union in the same direction toward <ent type='GPE'>Saryshagan</ent>... </p>

<p> Briefly, let us cover the uses of such a giant globe or spherical
shell of glowing EM energy and plasma. </p>

<p> By placing such a giant globe hundreds of miles out away from the
defended heartland, an entire arc of the sky can be defended against long
range ballistic missile attack in midcourse. During their midcourse
trajectory, the attacking missiles would have to penetrate the globular shell
twice, exposing them to giant internal EMPs twice. A very high probability
thus exists that all missiles entering the space occupied by the globe are
dudded upon entry and/or exit. This includes the electronics inside the
nuclear warheads themselves. Also this is particularly effective against <ent type='PERSON'>MIRV</ent>
and MARV missile carriers since the multiple re-entry vehicles are normally
still on the main vehicle during most of midcourse. The use of this midcourse
ABM globe defense greatly reduces the number of vehicles arriving at the
latter part of midcourse and the terminal phase of their trajectory. </p>

<p> By using a smaller, more intense globe, and placing it on incoming
clusters of objects or single objects, both EMP and local heating are used
against the objects. This is suitable in the latter part of midcourse and in
the terminal phase of ICBMs, IRBMs, SLBMs, and cruise missiles. It is also
useful against incoming strategic bombers and their air to surface missiles
both ballistic and cruise. </p>

<p> Two modes of the globes -- especially the small ones -- can be used.
First the continuous mode can be used to "fry" or vaporize incoming objects
in a relatively small volume (say ten to fifteen miles in diameter). Second,
the "pulse" mode can be used to "service" all incoming objects, whether or
not they have passed through the "large globe" midcourse defense. This
provides an additional guarantee of killing the objects; discrimination is
not require, just get all of them. The exposure of all incoming objects to
multiple attacks raises the probability of kill to essentially 100%, or as
close to that as one wishes. Of course the incoming vehicle may still
encounter a terminal defense consisting of the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> shield and associated
roving "<ent type='ORG'>quickshot</ent>" small intense globes. </p>

<p> In short, with these systems an essentially 100% ABM and anti bomber
defense is possible. Further, the <ent type='NORP'>Soviets</ent> have possessed such an effective
defense for two decades, JUST AS THEY HAVE OPENLY STATED SINCE 1960 WHEN
KHRUSHCHEV ANNOUNCED HIS "SUPERWEAPONS"!!

</p>

<p>--CONTINUOUS TESLA EMP GLOBE--

Here is another verified incident of a gigantic test of a <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>
scalar EM howitzer deep within the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union. </p>

<p> This is a C.I.A. report, released under the Freedom of Information
Act. One can be quite sure that the incident occurred as stated. </p>

<p> The phenomenon was seen from two aircraft approaching Mehrabad Airport
in <ent type='GPE'>Teheran</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> on June 17, 1966 and reported by their pilots. </p>

<p> On the far horizon deep within the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union, an intense spherical
ball of light appeared, "sitting on the horizon" so to speak. The globe of
light increased to enormous size, dimming as it did so, literally filling an
arc of the distant sky as it expanded. The sighting was shielded from most
ground observers view at the airport itself due to an intervening mountain
range which masked most of the phenomena from the ground. </p>

<p> The silent, expanding globe was observed for four or five minutes
before it faded away. </p>

<p> Again this is positive evidence of the testing of a giant scalar
interferometer, in the "midcourse ABM globe" type of action.</p>

<p> However, note the date -- mid 1966! The <ent type='NORP'>Soviets</ent> have therefore been
testing such scalar weapons of enormous size and power for at least two
decades. This implies that development must have started at least a decade
earlier, or in the mid '50s. </p>

<p> Still earlier, in January 1960 <ent type='PERSON'>Nikita Khrushchev</ent> had announced the
development of a "fantastic" <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> weapon, one which could even destroy all
life on earth if unrestrainedly used. In 1962 the ebullient <ent type='NORP'>Khrushchev</ent> was
forced to back down and lose face before <ent type='PERSON'>John Kennedy</ent>, in the <ent type='NORP'>Cuban</ent> Missile
Crisis. Khrushchev's missiles and bombers were in woeful shape, as <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>
well knew (by courtesy of the <ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent> spy, Colonel <ent type='PERSON'>Oleg Penkovsky</ent>). <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>
did not know that Khrushchev's new superweapons were nearing deployment, but
were not quite ready yet. </p>

<p> To save face and prevent his immediate ouster, <ent type='NORP'>Khrushchev</ent> apparently
conducted a startling two-strike demonstration of his new weapons as soon as
they became operationally ready. On April 10, 1963 he detected and destroyed
the U.S.S. Thresher nuclear submarine, using a scalar EM howitzer in the
underwater "continuous" mode. The next day he demonstrated the "pulsed"
underwater destruction mode for underwater subs by producing a giant
underwater
explosion underneath the water 100 miles north of <ent type='GPE'>Puerto Rico</ent>. Ironically,
just as the <ent type='LOC'>Atlantic</ent> was coming alive with U.S. naval vessels searching for
the lost Thresher, a second test of the weapons that had finished off the sub
occurred to the south of them, unnoticed and disregarded, even though seen
and reported to he F.B.I. and the U.S. Coast Guard by a passing U.S.
jetliner's pilot and crew, who observed the underwater explosion. </p>

<p> We thus can peg the development of these weapons by the <ent type='NORP'>Soviets</ent> as
starting well before 1960. The first operational deployment of the gigantic
strategic weaponry occurred in early 1963.

Note that the 1966 testing observed here is completely consistent
with this estimated development schedule. </p>

<p> Thus large <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> strategic scalar EM weapons have been operational
on site for 24 YEARS !!! This implies that at least three additional
generations of the scalar EM weapons have been developed and deployed by
now...
</p>

<p>--MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS OVER NORTH PACIFIC--

Incidents of <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> testing of the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> shield and the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> globe
weapons are routinely observed by airline pilots flying over the <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent>
Pacific into and out of <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>. </p>

<p> This is one typical example. Two jetliners, <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> Air Lines flights
403 and 421, sighted and reported a large glowing globe of light sitting just
beyond the horizon and extending well above it. The aircraft were in the
vicinity of 42 degrees N latitude and 153 degrees longitude at the time. The
sighting was thus about 700 miles east of <ent type='GPE'>Kushiro</ent>. </p>

<p> The diameter of the ball was estimated as at least 18-27 kilometers
by the pilots. Depending upon the actual distance to the sphere it may have
been of much larger size. </p>

<p> This incident is reported in <ent type='ORG'>the Asahi Evening</ent> News, <ent type='GPE'>Tokyo</ent>, June 22,
1982.

Many similar sightings have been reported by jet airliner pilots
flying over these waters.

--WHITE SPHERE SEEN IN <ent type='GPE'>NORTH ATLANTIC</ent> 1976--

Here is another sighting closer to home. </p>

<p> This incident was observed from a passing ship on June 221976 in the
<ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Atlantic</ent>, at about 2113-2140 hours. It is reported in the Marine
Observer, Vol.471977, p.66. </p>

<p> First an orange glow was sighted behind some distant clouds. A couple
of minutes later, a glowing white sphere of light was observed to the left of
the orange glow, just above the clouds. The white sphere then slowly expanded
to a much larger sphere, dimming as it expanded. At its maximum size, the top
of the white sphere reached about 24 degrees 30 minutes elevation angle to
<ent type='ORG'>the observer</ent>. Development to maximum size required about 10 minutes. </p>

<p> By 2140 hours the sphere had faded and disappeared. The sphere was
sufficiently thin that the stars could be seen through it at all times. </p>

<p> Again, this incident strong&lt;y fits the large <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> globe mode of a
<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> scalar EM interferometer.</p>

<p> The significance and role of the orange glow are not known at this
time.
</p>

<p>--CONTINUOUS TESLA FIREBALL--

Here is another incident that represents a stimulus to the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>
government, to see if the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> are aware of scalar electromagnetics.</p>

<p> Again this is a <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> report released under the Freedom of Information
Act, so the details are reliable.</p>

<p> On Sep. 10, 1976 <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> European Airways flight 831, flying between
<ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> and over <ent type='GPE'>Lithuania</ent> at the time, observed an intense ball
of light above the clouds below the aircraft. The light was so intense it
lit up the sky in the entire vicinity.</p>

<p> The concerned pilot reported the glowing object to <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> ground
authorities with whom he was in contact. He received harsh instructions to
ignore the light, and essentially to continue on his way out of there.</p>

<p> Here we see an incident involving a small, intense <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> globe, of the
kind with which the defense could "service" objects that had already
penetrated a large midcourse globe, or aircraft approaching the defended
area.</p>

<p> Obviously the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> authorities were tracking the aircraft, and knew
it was in the vicinity. It seems logical, then, that they deliberately
placed the brightly glowing ball beneath the aircraft so that the pilot and
crew could not fail to observe it.</p>

<p> The strange message to the pilot was simply designed to increase the
intensity of the stimulus. The stimulus was to be something like, "The
<ent type='NORP'>Soviets</ent> are doing something in research and development that allows them to
create intense balls of glowing light at a distance, and place these objects
in and around the air in and around aircraft, possibly to intercept them."
The purpose, of course, was to observe the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> governments reaction
after the incident was reported by the pilot upon his arrival in <ent type='GPE'>London</ent>.</p>

<p> Again the reaction of the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> -- and the U.S. as well -- was as
predicted. Again we showed that we knew nothing of scalar electromagnetic
weapons, and did not recognize one when we encountered its effects.
