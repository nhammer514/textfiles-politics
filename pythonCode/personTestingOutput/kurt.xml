<p>PROJECT: THE LAST GENERATION</p>

<p> THE BRAIN WASHING OF A GENERATION</p>

<p> Though this book deals with the <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> State educational
system, the same things are happening all over the country under
different names. For most of the school curriculum formation (writing
and tryed out) is done in <ent type='LOC'>the Pacific</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Northwest</ent> by the new age
movement for the <ent type='ORG'>National Education</ent> system As an insider, I can
explain how they have managed to go so far in government and law
making and gone undetected by the majority of the population. The
following gives some of the plans and ideas of leaders who are in the
radical reconstruction of our educational system. This book will give
an idea of how they have advanced, some of the results of their
advancement, and where the momentum seems to be taking us. Their
ideas and plans do not necessarily reflect the approval of the
teachers, professors, or educators in the State of <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> and U.
S.. I believe that most educators have very little idea of what has
been happening, and they have simply been going along with the flow.
All material being presented comes from documentation and testimony.</p>

<p> This book will show the taking over of the <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> system; with
the intent of wiping-out THE JUDEO - CHRISTIAN VALUES. By a conspiracy
which is written of by <ent type='PERSON'>Marilyn Ferguson</ent> in the Aquarian Conspiracy and
"she has found in the deepest roots of the educational system; she
quotes "There are lot of us in the woodwork." He, a veteran
bureaucrat, was referring to a loose coalition of conspirators in
agencies and congressional staffs. Within <ent type='ORG'>the Department</ent> Of <ent type='ORG'>Health</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> and Welfare, innovators have created informal rap groups to
share their strategies for slipping new ideas into a resistant system
and to give each other moral support. Concepts that might otherwise
appear "far out" can be given legitimacy by a single <ent type='ORG'>Federally</ent> funded
program. The grant making apparatus of government determines fashion
in some research fields. This aura of legitimacy is fostered here and
there by conspirator-bureaucrats."Some of the research projects that
were funded include: meditation, biofeedback, psychic phenomena, and
alternative medical approaches. ( Funded by <ent type='ORG'>the Dept</ent>. of Defense. )
Remember a federally funded program means your tax dollars are going
to the wiping - out JUDEO - CHRISTIAN VALUES with the occult values.
By the making of <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> of the value system no longer relevant.
Because there are more people with <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> values "NEW AGE" then the
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> values; so we as global citizens.need to change to a world
view, or so is the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> thinking goes.</p>

<p> A Parents Guide to Child's <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent></p>

<p> 1. Does any of the educational material present information which
depresses the child? (Nuclear distortion, environmental poisoning of
the world, death education, violence, separation from others,
rejection by peers thru role-playing or <ent type='GPE'>Syria</ent> games?)</p>

<p> 2. Is the child required to discuss unhappy events? ( Death,
accidents, war, morbid subjects, own epitaph, loss of family member)</p>

<p> 3. Does the teaching attempt to be moral-free and encourage the
child to determine their own moral values? Are they required to share
their moral values with others?</p>

<p> 4. is the child required to keep a diary which intimately discusses
family members? Is the child allowed to show the diary to their
parents?</p>

<p> 5. Are the text materials, films, videos, etc. of personal and
sensitive subjects beyond that appropriate for the child's age? Do
such materials have the effect of desensensitizing the child to
natural defenses (modesty, innocence, etc.) ?</p>

<p> 6. Is the child required to fill out attitudinal (psychological)
questionnaires as part of the curriculum? Has approval been given for
such questionnaires ? Is the parents allow to see them?</p>

<p> 7. Are all religions discussed? Are they taught as being equally
valid? Is <ent type='NORP'>Christianity</ent> discussed in any of the classes? To what
extent?</p>

<p> 8. Is the child introduced into <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> Religion practices and
beliefs, including reincarnation? ( return to earth in a new form
after death), deep concentration (self-hypnoses), yogi?</p>

<p> 9. IS the child required to make moral choices in hypothetical
situations? (Only a few can live, which few? Do if any of these
choices imply it is all right to lie, cheat, steal, kill, etc.?</p>

<p> 10. Does the child answer questionnaires or surveys that probe
into the child's or family's attitudes, feeling, behavior, customs, or
political preferences?</p>

<p> 11. Is the young child required to confront adult problems which
are too complex, unsuitable, or controversial for his tender years,
such as nuclear war, world starvation, etc.?</p>

<p> 12. Is the child constantly reminder that he/she should be world
oriented rather than country oriented? Is equality, or sameness, of
all countries taught, including <ent type='NORP'>communist</ent> countries? Are State laws
requiring teaching of patriotism being ignored?</p>

<p> 13. Does it teach or imply that "responsible" sex for teenagers is
all right? Are teenagers constantly reminded they are "sexually
active?" What guidelines of sexual behavior are given?</p>

<p> 14. Are you familiar with the content of the sex education courses
being given your child?</p>

<p> 15. Does the child make a " contract" with the teacher not to
discuss with parents subjects taught in the classroom?</p>

<p> COURT CASES/LAWS PERTAINING TO EDUCATION</p>

<p> Prince vs <ent type='GPE'>Massachusetts</ent> (1944) The U. S. Supreme Court said, "It is
cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child
reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom
include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply or
hinder."</p>

<p> <ent type='GPE'>Wisconsin</ent> v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205232 (1972) " The history and
culture of western civilization reflect a strong tradition of parental
concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children. This
primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now
established beyond debate as an enduring <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> tradition."</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Tinker</ent> vs Des moines Independent community school district (1969) "
Students do not shed their constitutional rights at the school house
door."</p>

<p> Title 32, Section 1983 of the civil rights Act provides that, "
<ent type='PERSON'>Eve</ent>ry person who under color of any statue, ordinance, regulation,
custom or usage of any state or territory subjects and causes to be
subjected, any citizen of the U. S. or any person within the
jurisdiction thereof to the depravation of any rights, privileges, or
the party injured in any action at law, suit in equity or other proper
proceedings for redress."</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Mercer</ent> vs <ent type='GPE'>Michigan</ent> State Board of <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> (1974) " The First
Amendment DOES NOT give a teacher the right to teach beyond the scope
of the curriculum"</p>

<p> <ent type='GPE'>WASHINGTON</ent> STATE LAWS</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>RCW</ent> 28A67.110 Teach morality/ patriotism " It shall be the duty of
all teachers to endeavor to impress on the minds of their pupils the
principles of morality, truth, justice, temperance, humanity and
patriotism, to teach them to avoid idleness, profanity, and falsehood,
to instruct them in the principles of free government and to train
them up to the comprehension of the rights, duty and dignity of
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> citizenship." <ent type='ORG'>RCW</ent> 28A.58.758 Basic <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> act of
1977-(school District Responsibilities)" (2)(f) Evaluate teaching
materials, including text books, teaching aids, handouts, or other
printed material, in public hearing upon complaint by parents,
guardians or custodians of students who consider dissemination of such
material to students objectionable.</p>

<p> IS YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT COMPLYING WITH THE LAWS??.</p>

<p> On April 25, 1982, folks around the western world opened up their
newspapers and found themselves staring at a startling full-page ad.
The ad trumpeted in bold headlines that:</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>The World</ent> has had enough of <ent type='ORG'>HUNGER</ent>, INJUSTICE, WAR, IN ANSWER TO
OUR CALL FOR HELP, AS WORLD TEACHER FOR ALL <ent type='NORP'>HUMANITYTHE</ent> CHRIST IS NOW
HERE! HUMANITY,.</p>

<p> The ad went on to say that this "Christ" has been emerging as a
spokesman quietly since 1977; that throughout history, mankind has
been guided by a group of enlightened men, the "Masters of Wisdom."
The ad claims that he is the "World Teacher," called <ent type='PERSON'>Maitreya</ent>, known
by <ent type='NORP'>Christians</ent> as the Christ, by the <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent> as the Messiah, by the
<ent type='NORP'>Buddhists</ent> as the fifth <ent type='PERSON'>Buddha</ent>, by the <ent type='NORP'>Muslims</ent> as the Imam Mahdi, and
by the <ent type='NORP'>Hindus</ent> as <ent type='PERSON'>Krishna</ent>. The ad claimed that he was hidden from the
world, but that within the next two months he would speak to humanity
in a worldwide TV broadcast in which his message would be heard by all
nations telepathically in their own language.</p>

<p> This ad was placed by a group called the Tara Center. In a
newsletter released by the Tara Center at the same time, some of the
concepts were explained under the broad heading, esotericism: [it]
might be described as the philosophy of the evolutionary process both
in man and nature. It is the science of the accumulated Wisdom of the
ages It is also the art of 'bringing down to earth' and anchoring
those energies which emanate from the highest sources. In recent
times, this information has been committed to writing and made more
accessible to the general public by a <ent type='NORP'>Tibetan</ent> Master, <ent type='PERSON'>Djwhal Khul</ent>,
through the writings of H.P. <ent type='PERSON'>Blavatsky</ent> and later, A.A. [<ent type='PERSON'>Alice</ent>]
<ent type='ORG'>Bailey</ent>.The article outlined the writings of <ent type='PERSON'>Blavatsky</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Bailey</ent>. It
explains that from 1919 to 1949, <ent type='PERSON'>Alice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Bailey</ent> received teachings from
the "Master DK" (<ent type='PERSON'>Djwhal Khul</ent>) which was published in 25 books by her
organization, <ent type='ORG'>Lucis Trust</ent>. The book The <ent type='ORG'>Rays</ent> and their Initiations
prophesied the revelation of this inner wisdom to the world "after
1975." In 1948, <ent type='ORG'>Bailey</ent> discussed the return of Christ in The
Reappearance of the Christ.</p>

<p> Extraordinary News!</p>

<p> If these claims were true, this would be extraordinary news: a
world-shattering event. However, close examination of this material
reveals things which do not tally with the Biblical version of the
second coming of Christ.</p>

<p> For example, in <ent type='PERSON'>Matthew</ent> 24:21-24; " For then will be a great
tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world
until this time, no, nor ever shall be. And unless those days were
shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect's sake those
days will be shortened. Then if anyone says to you, 'look, here is
the Christ or There do not believe it.' For false <ent type='NORP'>Christs</ent> and false
prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, so as to
deceive, if possible, even the elect."</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> also warns in the same passage that "If they shall say unto
you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the
secret chambers, believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of
the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of
the Son of man be." (vs.26-27)</p>

<p> Now the "Christ" mentioned above has never shown himself. He seems
to be shyly hiding in <ent type='GPE'>London</ent>. The prophecy about his appearance two
months after the April 1982 ad never came to pass, lo these 8 years
later. This does not fit the coming of <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> described in the Bible.
It obviously resembles <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent>' warning about the coming of a false
Christ!</p>

<p> The Bible does not does not allow the second coming of Christ to
involve a wimpy emergence from a <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> slum, nor a cosmic "We Are the
World" media blitz. Rev.1:7 says that "he cometh with clouds, and
every eye shall see him, and they also which pieced him: and all
kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. <ent type='PERSON'>Eve</ent>n so. Amen." 1
Thess.4:16 declares that "the Lord himself shall descend from heaven
with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of
God "</p>

<p> From these facts, it is quite obvious that the "Christ" being
heralded by the Tara Center and prophesied by writers such as <ent type='PERSON'>Alice</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Bailey</ent> is definitely not the <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> of the Bible. Thus, we must ask,
which <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> is it? Again, the Bible admonishes about one " that
cometh preacheth another <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent>, whom we have not preached" (2
Cor.11:4) Elsewhere, the apostle <ent type='PERSON'>Paul</ent> warns that " though we, or an
angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we
have preached unto you, let him be accursed." (Gal.1:8)</p>

<p> Though many do not realize that it is possible for there to be
folks out there who claim to be Christ who are actually lying to them,
these Bible verses make it clear that not only is it possible, but
that it was actually foretold 2000 years ago! In other words, not
everyone who claims to be teaching <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> doctrine is actually
doing so. Not every spiritual communication or supernatural
experience comes from God, or is necessarily good. This is why the
apostle, <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent>, warned us to "believe not every spirit, but try the
spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone
out into the world." (1 <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> 4:1) We have "tried" this "Christ" and
found him wanting by Biblical standards. But if this is not a
Bible-based <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> Christ, then whose Christ is he? The answer, as
you may have already guessed, is that he is the Christ of the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent></p>

<p> Are We Really the World?</p>

<p> That real problem leads us to the final area we wish to consider:
the impact of <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> thinking upon education, politics, and even the
church. Realize that nature abhors a vacuum, and that with the waning
influence of genuine Biblical <ent type='NORP'>Christianity</ent> in the US and Europe;
another spirituality is rushing in to fill the void. Many old,
main-line churches which have abandoned the simple gospel have turned,
in the past decade, to the ancient lie of the serpent, mentioned
earlier.</p>

<p> As those churches in the US and Europe have lost their light, so
the political and education infrastructures of society have been
progressively filled with a flood of <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> occultism. This is only
natural, since the Lord intended His church to be salt, and the salt
has, in many cases, lost its savour. Thus, today, Europe and the US
are becoming "post-<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> societies." The most evident
manifestation of this is the vast stampede toward what is called
"globalism." While some may deny a concerted "conspiracy" in this
area, it is evident that there is a systematic effort to destroy any
sense of national or religious loyalty. The idea of any nation or
religion being better than another has become the ultimate heresy. It
is continually anathematized in the media. <ent type='NORP'>Christians</ent> who insist,
with <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent>, that He is the only way to God (<ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> 14:6) are branded as
fundamentalist bigots. Biblical <ent type='NORP'>Christianity</ent> has become the only
"minority group" which can be mocked or persecuted in our
"pluralistic" culture with impunity. This kind of cultural unanimity
cannot be coincidence.</p>

<p> <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> believers aren't the world! We are not "global
citizens." <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> said, "the world hath hated them [His disciples],
because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
<ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> 17:14. Our Lord has warned us! We cannot say we didn't have an
advance notice. But let us look and see precisely where the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>
globalism is working in our political and educational community. Both
education and politics have been linked together, especially since the
politicization of public education in this century. The National
<ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> Association (<ent type='ORG'>NEA</ent>) has been working hard for decades to mold
education into a globalist, left-wing propaganda tool. They have
pretty well succeeded. Whether the NEA's agenda is exactly the same
as the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> agenda is difficult to say. However, they do have a
great deal in common.</p>

<p> The <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> education agenda is best found in the book, <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent>
in the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> by the aforementioned <ent type='PERSON'>Alice Baliey</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>Lucis Trust</ent>. In
the book, the "<ent type='NORP'>Tibetan</ent> Master" spells out a detailed program which
includes:</p>

<p> 1) Children should be trained to accept a One-world global
government and culture without question.</p>

<p> 2) Full implementation of the anti-<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> educational
philosophies of <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Dewey, but with a more eastern metaphysical
approach.</p>

<p> 3) Destruction of the ideals of patriotism and national pride,
helping kids become "world citizens."</p>

<p> 4) <ent type='NORP'>Hinduism</ent> and other pagan religions must be emphasized as
attempts are made to blend them into <ent type='NORP'>Western</ent> civilization.</p>

<p> 5) Orthodox <ent type='NORP'>Christianity</ent> must be demeaned and declared obsolete to
the children, while lifting up the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> "One World" religion.</p>

<p> 6) The <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> pluralistic religion (All paths lead to God - all
religions are equally valid) will be taught as the only acceptable
belief system, excluding <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent>' unique claims.</p>

<p> 7) Adolescents will be encouraged to force these doctrines on their
parents and rebel if the parents do not cooperate.</p>

<p> 8) Essential <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> doctrines like hell, judgement or even
heaven are to be mocked and denied. Rather, karma and reincarnation
should be taught</p>

<p> 9) Permissive methods of discipline will be fostered, and concepts
such as sin and guilt are felt to be unevolved and counter-productive.</p>

<p> 10) Children are taught that death is not an enemy to be feared or
fought off, but rather is to be embraced as part of "the Plan."</p>

<p> 11) They are also to be taught that people who do not accept the
<ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> teachings (ie. Bible-believers) are an evolutionary "drag" on
humanity and must either capitulate or be killed like a bacterial
infection.</p>

<p> 12) The model of the traditional family and its sexual mores must
be discarded, and loyalty to one's family must be replaced by loyalty
to the world. It is frightening to note how many of these concepts,
first promulgated a generation ago, have become standard features of
public education, supported by our tax dollars! More and more of
these ideas are being brought in every semester! Both of the authors
of this booklet were involved in education and curriculum formation
for schools while occultists; and used our positions to indoctrinate
our charges in <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> values. That was years ago! Today, the "brain
trust" behind modern education reads like a Who's Who of the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Dee Dickinson</ent>, the director of <ent type='ORG'>New Horizons for Learning</ent>, is a
member of President Bush's <ent type='ORG'>White House Task Force</ent> on Innovative

at <ent type='ORG'>Antioch University</ent> (a teachers' college!) in cooperation with the
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> Association. This course includes subjects like
astrology and tapping the human potential. A frequent lecturer at
<ent type='GPE'>Antioch</ent> is <ent type='PERSON'>Miriam Starhawk</ent>, one of the leading spokeswomen for <ent type='NORP'>Wicca</ent>

<p> ARE YOUR CHILDERN BEING "<ent type='ORG'>INITIATED</ent>" BY <ent type='PERSON'>LUCIFER</ent>?</p>

<p> Ms. <ent type='PERSON'>Dickinson</ent>, is also an advisor on the In <ent type='ORG'>Contex</ent>t project, which
has such other <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> luminaries as <ent type='PERSON'>Peter Caddy</ent> (<ent type='GPE'>Findhorn</ent>),"sacred"
psychologist <ent type='PERSON'>Jean Houston</ent> (Foundation for Mind Research), David
Spangler (Lorian Foundation), and <ent type='PERSON'>Danaan Perry</ent> (Holy Earth
Houndation)! Spangler is one of the top men in the world in <ent type='LOC'>the New</ent>
Age movement, and has taught that "No one will be allowed to enter the
<ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> unless he or she takes a <ent type='ORG'>Luciferic</ent> initiation Whenman entered
the pathway of self, he entered into a great creative adventure, of
learning the meaning of divinity by accepting himself. The being that
helps him reach that point is <ent type='PERSON'>Lucifer</ent>, the angel of man's evolution
<ent type='PERSON'>Lucifer</ent> is an agent of God's love Christ is the same force as <ent type='PERSON'>Lucifer</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Lucifer</ent> prepares man for the experience of <ent type='ORG'>Christhood</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Lucifer</ent> works
within each of us to bring us to wholeness as we move into <ent type='LOC'>the New</ent>
Age". WOULD YOU WANT TO TRUST YOUR CHILD'S EDUCTION TO <ent type='ORG'>PEOPLE WHO</ent>
KEEP THIS KIND OF THEOLOGICAL COMPANY? The <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> dogmas outline
above permeate much of the educational philosophy prevalent in the US.
Leading <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> writer, <ent type='PERSON'>Marilyn Ferguson</ent>, expands on the intent behind
the " new curriculum". "<ent type='ORG'>Alter</ent> states of consciousness are taken
seriously: "centering" exercises, meditation, relaxation, and fantasy
are used to keep the intuitive pathways open and the whole brain
learning. There are techniques to encourage body awareness:
breathing, relaxation, yoga, movement, biofeedback". "Their techniques
are the following: Guided Imagery, Visualization, Yoga, TM, and "
Teachers are to incorporate the following activities in their
classrooms. Do Yoga exorcizes, do visualization and guided imagery
techniques."</p>

<p> Beverly Gallion says, "Don't call it that. Call it centering down
or the crazies will get all bent out of shape. Relaxation, call it
deep breathing." (Its really Yoga and TM)</p>

<p> Ferguson believes that it is the duty of the educators to function
as CHANGE AGENTS and wean children away from the morality of their
parents and culture:" A major ambition of the curricum is autonomy.
This is based on the belief that if our children are to be free, they
must be free even from us-from our limiting believes and our acquired
tastes... This means teaching for healthy, appropriate rebellion, not
conformity. Maturity brings with it a morality that derives from the
innermost self, not from mere obedience to the culture's norms".</p>

<p> This kind of idea has been in place with funding from the U.S.
Department of <ent type='ORG'>Health</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> and Welfare since 1969. It is called
BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAM (<ent type='ORG'>BSTEP</ent>). One of the its
major goals is the development of a new kind of elementary school
teacher who engages in teaching as clinical practice, and functions as
a responsible agent of social change. In plain English, that means
that they want teachers to become behavioral psychotherapists, but
without having to go through the years of training and certification
that real therapists must achieve. Do you wish your child to be used
as a guinea pig by amateur psychologist teachers?</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>BSTEP</ent> suggests:"the humanities are designed to promote an
understanding of human behavior in humanistic terms... Students are
to be exposed to non-western thought and values in order to sensitize
them to their own backgrounds and inherent cultural biases. Thus, the
student's <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> values are now pass@. This educational
methodology has sown seeds which we now harvesting two decades later;
and it is bitter harvest indeed. In helping our children to be "free"
of "cultural biases" and to have "healthy rebellion," we have reaped
sky-rocketing drug abuse, unwed mothers, crack babies, illicit sex,
and public schools that have become citadels of rape and carnage!</p>

<p> Now, in the midst of growing public alarm, the education
establishment, has been forced to backpedal, and now we are inundated
with homilies about drugs and "safe" sex, even though drugs and sexual
"freedom" were cornerstones of the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> movement. Lecturers at the
above-cited <ent type='GPE'>Antioch</ent> workshop extolled "the Holy prostitute" and
perverted sexual practices. Indeed, very <ent type='NORP'>Hitlerian</ent> concepts of
planned parenthood, eugenics, and sexual freedom were taught by <ent type='PERSON'>Alice</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Bailey</ent>, a guiding thinker of the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>.</p>

<p> Thanks to the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> influence in the educational
establishment,these kinds of courses have become common fare for
teacher education in many states. Many teachers do not know the
spiritual content of this material and look upon it as "feminist" or
"cross-cultural." Most of them do not understand what they have been
led into, <ent type='PERSON'>Andre</ent> essentially very dedicated educators who just don't
know that they have been sold a bill of goods.</p>

<p> Is the World Getting Any Better?</p>

<p> Another problem with reincarnation is the fact that if it were
true, then people should be "evolving" and the world should be getting
demonstrably better. Empirically though, it really isn't. This
century has seen war and slaughter to a degree unparalleled in human
history! If we are standing on the pinnacle of untold centuries of
spiritual evolution, then how could we have produced a <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> or a
<ent type='PERSON'>Charles Manson</ent> (both reincarnationists!). If reincarnation is true,
then we should be a planet of saints by now. Yet who among us would
say that our nation is better now than it was a short generation ago.
We cannot even walk the streets of <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> cities without fear,
whereas 20 years ago, many of the homes in this land were not even
locked at night! Is this spiritual evolution through reincarnation,
or is the result of a generation of children being raised on New
Age-oriented educational system of values clarification, in which no
absolute moral values are allowed. After all, who would dare give a
little god any moral rules?</p>

<p> I. <ent type='ORG'>THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONNECTIONS</ent>.</p>

<p> The following quote comes from a school's request to become part of
the <ent type='ORG'>Schools</ent> for the 21st Century project.Quote: "Imagine a place where
nothing is impossible!! A place where our best dreams become
realities and everyone is involved in creating the magic. Imagine
what Mountlake can become." Sounds great, so what's wrong with this
statement? "U.S. Plan to 'Take Over' Grade <ent type='ORG'>Schools</ent> Intimated." "Is the
U.S Office of <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent>..., poised for a total takeover of every
elementary school in the nation?" "That was indicated Thursday in a
federally funded project at Cal State, <ent type='GPE'>Fullerton</ent> by <ent type='PERSON'>Bernard Kravett</ent>, a
professor at the school who took part last year in a federally funded
project at <ent type='ORG'>the University</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>." "Known as the Tri-University
project, three universities were involved in a massively funded
federal project to restructure the entire higher education system for
training teachers, which, in effect, would make local elementary
schools only a subsidiary arm of the federal government." .."There
will no longer be such a thing as an autonomous college. All teacher
training institutions will operate jointly with local school districts
and teacher organizations to 'establish performance criteria which
become behavioral objectives.'" (programming the teachers) .."All
education will be built on behavioral tasks rather than on courses,
credits and grade point averages..." "he (<ent type='PERSON'>Kravett</ent>) said the government
was spending 'fantastic amounts of money and <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Government</ent> is
totally behind it, pushing it and providing all the money you can
possibly need.'"</p>

<p> Their main goal is: To move the kids and schools into the 21st
century by educating them to become citizens of a global society,

No one will be allowed to enter the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> unless he or she takes a
<ent type='ORG'>Luciferic</ent> initiation Whenman entered the pathway of self, he entered
into a great creative adventure, of learning the meaning of divinity
by accepting himself. The being that helps him reach that point is
<ent type='PERSON'>Lucifer</ent>, the angel of man's evolution <ent type='PERSON'>Lucifer</ent> is an agent of God's
love Christ is the same force as <ent type='PERSON'>Lucifer</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Lucifer</ent> prepares man for the
experience of <ent type='ORG'>Christhood</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Lucifer</ent> works within each of us to bring us
to wholeness as we move into the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>." ( This is blasphemy and the
religion of the <ent type='PERSON'>Antichrist</ent>) <ent type='PERSON'>Benjamin Crem</ent> (<ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> director of
the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> Movement)-</p>

<p> "There will be a mass initiation of all peoples of earth, no one
will enter the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> without taking a <ent type='ORG'>Luciferic</ent> initiation." [i.e.
you would not be eligible for an I.D. number without first taking a
pledge to worship <ent type='PERSON'>Lucifer</ent>. They are talking about the mark of the
beast as written in the Bible.]</p>

<p> THE NEW AGE PARTY LINE.</p>

<p> Channeling or.(medium) as defined by <ent type='PERSON'>David Spangler</ent> a <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>
leader and writer. "Channeling is a phenomenon in which a physical
person enters an altered state of consciousness and lends his or her
mind and/or body (depending on the technique employed) to be used by a
nonphysical entity in order to communicate from its level of existence
to ours." Now in <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> terms from ex New-Ager who channel for
over 15 years both for the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> and the <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> church. When I
was led by mother to take my first spirt (demon) at the age of 3. I
will never forget the feeling of that demon came into to my small
body. First I felt a warm felling; But I knew that it was an invader
(not of myself). When I first started to used the spirt guide to
speak thought me; And answer questions that was given to me .The spirt
was almost never wrong. Is God ever wrong? This channeling went on
in front of occult and church groups till I was 21.. Most church
goers did not know that I was Channeling ; because I used all christen
terms and <ent type='GPE'>prophesyed</ent> in "THE SPIRT".</p>

<p> In the the book of 1Thess. 5:19-22: 19 "Quench not the Spirit. 20
Despise not prophesying. 21 Prove all things; hold fast that which is
good. 22 Abstain from all appearance of evil". We must check all
prophesy to the Word of the God if it does not line up get rid of it.
God is never wrong. And most of all check witch [sic] spirt is being
used for prophesy. also in <ent type='PERSON'>Matthew</ent> 24: 23-24: 23" Then if any man
shall say unto you, lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. 24
For there shall arise false Christ, and false prophets, and shall shew
great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they
shall deceive the very elect". The Bible teaches that trying to
contact the dead (whether ordinary dead folks like "<ent type='PERSON'>Uncle Harry</ent>" or
distinguished dead folks like <ent type='ORG'>Ramtha</ent>) is very dangerous Sin! (<ent type='PERSON'>Lev</ent>.
19:31, Deut, 18:10-12,Is 8:19-20, Rev.21:8) In the old Testament, the
penalty for consulting with those who spoke with "familiar spirits" or
spirit guides was death (Ex. 22:18, <ent type='PERSON'>Lev</ent>. 20:6)! God wasn't kidding
with this!</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Muller</ent>, former Assistant Secretary to <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> Nations and
integral in getting <ent type='ORG'>the Lucius Trust</ent> [<ent type='PERSON'>Lucifer</ent>Trust] into the U.N.
Bldg. "The great evolutionary challenge is as follows:</p>

<p> 1. Science, technology, transports and communications have ushered
us into the Global Age;</p>

<p> 2. The world has not yet adjusted politically, economically,
mentally, and spiritually to that New Global Age;</p>

<p> 3. As an individual I must help the birth of a better world by
transferring my love from my family, my group, my nation-- to the
world, to humanity and to the heavens.</p>

<p> 4. Global education is the essential means to bring about this
transformation;</p>

<p> 5. Theosophists are an essential network in the process of
planetary synthesis. You have members all over the world. You have
unlimited human resources for effectuating positive world change."</p>

<p> NOTE: What <ent type='PERSON'>Muller</ent> means by essential network is: Quote- " I believe
that the greatest networked are those who did it at the highest
levels--people like the <ent type='PERSON'>Buddha</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> Christ, <ent type='PERSON'>Gandhi</ent>, Schweitzer,
Teilhard de Chardin, <ent type='PERSON'>Martin Luther King</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Dag Hammerskjold</ent>, U Thant
people who really transcended races, nations, and groups and networked
at all human levels, linking the heavens and the earth and showing us
our prodigious worth and journey in the universe. The real networked
are those who go deepest and come closest to the mystery of life in
the universe."</p>

<p> I believe that this GLOBAL SOCIETY is the fulfillment of God's Word
in: REV 13 (one world govt, one world leader, one world economy, one
world religion) 2 <ent type='ORG'>TIM</ent> 3:1-5 Mt 24:24 Col 2:8</p>

<p> In a book published in 1978 by <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> Nations Association of
<ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>: "Helping Boys and Girls to Discover the
World"( with the subtitle of "Teaching about Global Concerns and the
United Nations in Elementary and Middle School": 74pp. Page 1. "Girls
and boys growing up today have a right and a need to realize that they
are part of an amazing, totally new development in human history,"
says <ent type='PERSON'>Jean Picker</ent>, Vice Chairman of the publishing association.
Further she announces boldly that "...at <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> Nations, work is
underway to forge a global community able to meet the challenges of
the next century.</p>

<p> "Both on a national scale and international scale, globalism is
being promoted by <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Muller</ent>, author of "The <ent type='ORG'>New Genesis</ent>": He has
written in his book that the global education is simply a means to a
spiritual utopian society. He looks toward a cosmic government of a
one world religion; a one world ruler who is ruled by a great cosmic
religious force. Unfortunately, when this book was published people
like Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Gordon Kuaiti</ent>, who was Executive Director of the Association
for Curriculum Development, took the bait. " After reading Dr.
Muller's book, he wrote: What we need is to bring the children of the
schools and this curriculum (the spiritual development in Dr.
Muller's book) so that our children can become part of the coming
world religion." Who is this man who was the former Assistant
Secretary General to <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> Nations? " I am the representative of
<ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> Nations Secretary General on the council to <ent type='ORG'>the University</ent>.
I am very excited about this new and important venture. World
education is making good progress. I HAVE PRODUCED A WORLD CORE
<ent type='ORG'>CURRICULUM</ent> which I would like to see adopted in all schools on the
planet....A spiritual version of it appears in "<ent type='ORG'>New Genesis</ent>".</p>

<p> At <ent type='ORG'>the Soviet</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Citizens Summit conference (Feb 1989), Dr.
<ent type='PERSON'>Muller</ent> was a keynote speaker. Their goal was to work together in task
forces in such fields as health, education, business, psychological
and social change, world views and morals, religion, atheism, and
spirituality. Their goal is to identify joint projects and "social
inventions for the third millennium."</p>

<p> The other keynote speaker was <ent type='PERSON'>Ted Turner</ent> of "<ent type='ORG'>Turner Broadcasting</ent>".
He has given his stance on world affairs by making statements like:
"<ent type='GPE'>America</ent> is the greatest problem in the world. The <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> way is the
only way to go." Did he forget that Marxism has murdered 80-100
million people, enslaving half the world, and was raping <ent type='GPE'>Afghanistan</ent>,
plus killing <ent type='NORP'>Christians</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Ethiopia</ent>? Also speaking at
the summit was <ent type='PERSON'>Barbara Marx Hubbard</ent> who spoke on: "The vision and
purpose of the summit." <ent type='PERSON'>Barbara Marx Hubbard</ent>: A Vice Presidential
nominee at the 1984 <ent type='ORG'>Democratic Convention</ent>, Founder of the Global

other <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>-related programs.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Barbara</ent> has rewritten <ent type='LOC'>the New</ent> Testament, calling for removal of
half the world's population. According to her own public
announcement, she is now under full control of her spirit guide. From
her book Spirit Guides she writes " Humanity will not be able to make
the transition from earth to universal life until the chaff has been
separated from the wheat."</p>

<p> She's referring to <ent type='NORP'>Christians</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent> as being the chaff. "The
great reaper must reap before we can take the quantum leap to the next
phase of evolution. No world peace can prevail until the self
centered members of the planetary body either change or die." "Before
the stage of power can be inherited by the god centered members of the
social body, the self centered members must be destroyed. There is no
alternative, we are in charge of the selection process for the planet
earth" [her god is <ent type='PERSON'>Lucifer</ent>] <ent type='PERSON'>Barbara Marx Hubbard</ent> was <ent type='EVENT'>the World Peace</ent>

<p> In association with curriculum exchange with <ent type='ORG'>the Soviet</ent> Union,
funded by the U.S. govt, <ent type='ORG'>the Carnegie</ent> Foundation was to develop a

<p> Some of the leading <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Globalists</ent> who have tremendous power
and influence were described to show who they are and the people and
organizations who are under them. This gives us an idea of the
infiltration into our educational system by the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> Movement.
<ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> happens to be the link to a whole generation.</p>

<p> II. RELIGIOUS ASPECTS AND SOME COMPARISONS WITH SCRIPTURE.</p>

<p> To help you understand some of the terms that are being used, here
are a list of the most common terms.</p>

<p> The Scriptures prophesy of the coming of what we refer to as the
<ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>. There is nothing new about the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>. From <ent type='ORG'>Genesis</ent>
through the <ent type='GPE'>Babylonian</ent> religion, comes the same old lie in a new
package.</p>

<p> The <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> is essentially all the modern day occult-based
philosophies and practices rolled up in to one world religion. This
wide range of spirt worship, <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> mysticism, Mind-scince religion
and avant-garde psychology. Its essence "oneness" or god-within.
Thus people have to look no further than themselves for all of life's
answers.</p>

<p> This is same lie that <ent type='PERSON'>Eve</ent> was taught in Gen. 3:1-5 is taught by New
Age teachers , leaders and by the serpent. That serpent in the garden
was "initiating" <ent type='PERSON'>Eve</ent> into higher consciousness You will notices 3
concepts in the serpent's lie:</p>

<p> 1) "Yea, hath God said...?"(verse 1). He cast doubt on the Word of
God.</p>

<p> 2) "Ya shall not surely die..." (verse 4) He denied the the reality
of death</p>

<p> 3)"... your eyes shall be open, and shall be as gods..."(verse 5)
Finally, he claimed that she could attain the status of God.. You do
not have look any father than Gen 3:14-19 to see that the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>r
brings the curse of death upon themselves though the same <ent type='ORG'>SIN</ent> as <ent type='PERSON'>Adam</ent>
and <ent type='PERSON'>Eve</ent> did. Or as it says in <ent type='NORP'>Romans</ent> 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man
sin entered into the earth, and death passed upon all men, for all
have sinned. There is no other way to get rid of this sinful burden
with out taking the Bible the way it was written verse upon verse. In
<ent type='NORP'>Romans</ent> 6:23: "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is
eternal life through <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> Christ our Lord";</p>

<p> Only through this free gift we get our eternal life. Not through
some New "not so" Age LIE, that is based only on one verse. <ent type='PERSON'>Lou Tice</ent>
who is the founder of <ent type='LOC'>the Pacific</ent> Institute and a leader in <ent type='LOC'>the New</ent>
Age movement-<ent type='PERSON'>Lou Tice</ent> teaches for <ent type='ORG'>the Seattle School District</ent>, many
businesses, the <ent type='PERSON'>Eve</ent>rett Police dept., and many more. Quote: "I am a
wizard, I have god like powers."<ent type='PERSON'>Lou Tice</ent> video series tape 30 is 'New
Age Thinking For Achieving Your Potential'. Quote: "This program has
provided you with a wealth of concepts and important life changing
tools. These tools can be used to achieve whatever you truly want to
achieve now and for the rest of your life."</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>David Wilkerson</ent> wrote...</p>

<p> "Your destiny is in the power of your mind, whatever you can
conceive is yours, speak it into being..., this is not the gospel of
<ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> Christ. Let it be known once and for all, God will not advocate
His Lordship to the power of our minds, negative or positive.
Christ's mind is focused on the glory of God and the obedience to the
Word of God." Speaking of the name it and claim it teaching going
around the church today he says, "No other teaching so ignores the
cross of <ent type='ORG'>Calvary</ent>, the corruption of the human mind. It bypasses the
evil of our ruined <ent type='PERSON'>Adam</ent>s nature and it takes the <ent type='NORP'>Christians</ent> eyes off
of <ent type='NORP'>Christs</ent> gospel of our eternal redemption and focuses them on
earthly gain. Saints of God flee these things."</p>

<p> Do you see a parallel teaching between <ent type='PERSON'>Lou Tice</ent> and the name it and
claim it teaching? We are created for God's pleasure and not our own.
The Bible says that we are to love the Lord our God with our whole
hearts, mind, and soul, plus God says that the righteous shall live by
faith. That faith is in God and not the schemes of <ent type='PERSON'>Satan</ent> for the
false self satisfactions that he offers which are not lasting but
rather end up in destruction. The Truth that God gives us says that
we are not the gods that <ent type='PERSON'>Lou Tice</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> movement want us to
be.</p>

<p> If you think that the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>rs are not trying to change us, listen
carefully to the words of <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Denver the actor and member of EST.
(now known as Forum) Quote: " My greatest ambition is to wean
<ent type='NORP'>Christians</ent> away from the superstitions about <ent type='NORP'>Christianity</ent> and liberate
them from the delusion of any God but themselves. I'll be a god
someday."</p>

<p> THE NEW AGE AND THE BIBLE:</p>

<p> When I was in the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> for the 18+ years the Bible was more
accepted but very twisted to meet the Dogma of the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> leaders.
Another former top <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> leader put this way. "In <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>
philosophy, the Holy Bible is accepted, but only conditionally, it
being taken only as one scripture among many others. Also, I began to
see that <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> philosophy picks and chooses what it likes and
doesn't like from the pages of the Bible. It also re-interprets these
select passages with a metaphysical <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> slant. .the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>
Movement (or <ent type='ORG'>NAM</ent>) has not only taken the Word of God, but many common
used christen terms and put them in to there every-day lingo. First
we must bring the new-ager to the understanding of what the Bible
is.The Bible is not only a good book but it is the word of God; you
see this in</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> 1: 1-5 " In the beginning was the Word,and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God. 2 The same was in the beginning with God. 3
All things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made
that was made. 4 In him was life ;and the life was the light of men.</p>

<p> 5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended
it not. For the <ent type='ORG'>NAM</ent> thinks there are many gods and does not
understand <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> 1 ;1-3 so we must fallow with 1 Corinthians, 8:56: 5
For thought there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in
earth,(as there be gods many, and lords many,) 6 But to us there is
but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and
one lord <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> Christ, by whom are things, and we by him.There is only
one one God the God of the Bible. (NOT SELF) as <ent type='ORG'>NAM</ent> believes.The <ent type='ORG'>NAM</ent>
does not understand what will happen to anybody that tampers with the
Bible ; in Rev. 22: 1819 it's says "For I testify unto every man that
heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add
unto him the plagues that are written in this book: 19 And if any man
shall take away from the words of God shall take away his part out of
the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which
are written in this book. As <ent type='NORP'>Christians</ent> we need to know our Bible and
<ent type='PERSON'>Christen</ent> terms for life we save may be you or a love one. Do not be
afraid to ask the question, Of what does that term mean to you but
also if they know <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> Christ as there personal savour.</p>

<p> JESUS CHRIST AND THE NEW AGE.</p>

<p> The <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>NAM</ent> disciplines believe that <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> is one of many
great masters who have lived on earth. He had to work through many
lifetimes to attain the Christ-self . He was able, by studying under
<ent type='NORP'>Egyptian</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Tibetan</ent> masters, to acquire occult power to do miracles
Once he did so, he was able to pass it on to his disciples.</p>

<p> Just who is <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> Christ is he the Lord of all; The Bible teaches
that <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> is God (<ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> 1:1-214, Col. 1:15), and that He is uniquely
God in Rev. 1:1117-18 and 22:13-16 <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> states that He is God, the
first and the last-the only God there ever was or will be ( <ent type='PERSON'>Isaiah</ent>
43:10). Anyone who thus denies <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> is denying Good (1 <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> 2:23).
This is not the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent>. Check out which <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> it is. (see
<ent type='PERSON'>Matthew</ent> 24: 23-24).</p>

<p> The <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> movement has its roots in <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent> had no
absolutes. <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent> was the 1st city built after the flood. <ent type='ORG'>Semiramis</ent>
was the Queen of <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Nimrod</ent> the son, the husband of his
mother, led the people into rebellion against God. <ent type='ORG'>Nimrod</ent> was a
master warlock [sic] (male witch) [sic], and under his direction
astrology was developed. Later he was called <ent type='PERSON'>Moloch</ent>, and sacrifices
to <ent type='PERSON'>Moloch</ent> were not uncommon.</p>

<p> This was the taking of children and passing them through the fire
as a sacrifice to <ent type='PERSON'>Moloch</ent>. After <ent type='ORG'>Nimrod</ent> was killed by Shem (Noah's
son), <ent type='ORG'>Semiramis</ent> proclaimed that she is a goddess; and she demanded
that babies be sacrificed to her. <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent> was also known for its
tower of Babel</p>

<p> (Gen. 11:4) "whose top may reach into heaven". Ungers Bible
Dictionary says that this expression is showing their pride and
rebellion against God. They tried to build a society that would reach
into heaven; and the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> movement is trying to regain the society
that will reach into heaven and usher in the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> or <ent type='LOC'>New World</ent>
Order. Their ideas include the universal mind set to establish
globalism, and trample on <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> values. (We are one consciousness;
visualize world peace and it will come about.)</p>

<p> This concept is extremely dangerous to <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Christians</ent> because
the only way to accomplish this in their mind set is to purge (kill)
all the 'negative forces' (<ent type='NORP'>Christians</ent>,<ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent>)and then they can be gods
with eternal life by ushering in the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> through visualization as
a unified global mind. Its the 'think peace' concept - By the way,
they don't think they are killing anyone because they think we will
just be reincarnated eventually as one of them after we have had time
to think about it.</p>

<p> You will see throughout this outline the ties between <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent>
Religion, the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> Movement and our <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent>al System as it is
being developed. <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent> was brought into this discussion to show
<ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> Religions basic roots and <ent type='PERSON'>Occult</ent>ism.</p>

<p> III. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM.</p>

<p> The radical reconstruction of our school system (in the U.S.)
funded by our tax dollars, and the lobbying force of the N.E.A.
(<ent type='ORG'>National Education</ent> Association), and the W.E.A. (<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent>
Association), will bring a new reformed <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent> to earth. (let me
build on this.) Their purpose is to educate our children to reject
differences in sex, intelligence, culture, values, ethnic systems, and
religious values. No absolutes. This translates into creating a new
government order, a new economical system, and a new religious order.
(The <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>) All this BEGINS in the <ent type='ORG'>RADICAL</ent> reconstruction of our
educational system. A. CONTROL THE SYSTEM.</p>

<p> How DO THEY BEGIN? By taking control of the educational system and
by teaching the teachers!</p>

<p> 1. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND <ent type='ORG'>WELFARE</ent>. The
program called <ent type='ORG'>BSTEP</ent> (Behavioral Science Teacher <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> Program)
designed from 1965-1969 with funds from the U.S. Department of <ent type='ORG'>Health</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> and Welfare. OBJECTIVES OF <ent type='ORG'>BSTEP</ent> ARE STATED AS FOLLOWS:
THREE MAJOR GOALS:</p>

<p> a. Development of a new kind of elementary school teacher who is
basically well educated; engages in teaching as clinical practice, and
functions as a responsible agent of social change.b. The use of
research and clinical experience in decision-making processes at all
levels.c. Using the BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, for undergraduate and active
teacher education programs, and recycle evaluations of teaching tools
and performance. These goals inform us of the change from academic
excellence, to behavioral motivations to control our society.</p>

<p> Quote:</p>

<p> "Clinical behavioral style permeates every phase of the program.
Prospective teachers are trained so that they employ it; university
professors practice it; and the program itself regenerates through the
clinical process." ...the teacher is now a psycho-social therapist
utilizing the fields of psychology and sociology. The program is
designed to focus the skills and knowledge of <ent type='ORG'>Behavioral Scientists</ent> on
education problems, translating research into viable programs for
preserve and in-service teachers. The traditional concept of research
as theory is not discarded, but the emphasis is shifted to a form of
practical action-research in classrooms and laboratory. ( In other
words, school children are simply to be used as guinea pigs.)
'Students are to be exposed to non-western thought and values in order
to sensitize them to their own backgrounds and inherent cultural
biases.' Through a carefully structured sequence of experiences, the
decision-making of social scientists are explored and students are
provided opportunities to employ these decision-making processes in
real and simulated situations." What a beautiful example from the
<ent type='ORG'>BSTEP</ent> program for up-heaving cherished values by portraying
individuals and events in a purposely biased way. Under the guise of
supposedly making children knowledgeable regarding various
lifestyles--students will be systematically programmed to believe that
all formerly held <ent type='NORP'>Judeo</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> values are passe' and no longer
relevant. This is currently being done by <ent type='ORG'>the Superintendent</ent> of
Public <ent type='ORG'>Schools</ent> Office through the Multicultural <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> Resource
Series. This is designed as a "Multi-Disciplinary" approach. This
means they use eastern religions and values to water down and
eventually do away with the traditional <ent type='NORP'>Judeo</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> Values. (
<ent type='ORG'>BSTEP</ent> was publicly funded to wipe out <ent type='NORP'>Judeo</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> values.)</p>

<p> The <ent type='ORG'>BSTEP</ent> program certainly fulfills the description of the N.E.A's
<ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> for the 70's, which said;"<ent type='ORG'>Schools</ent> will become clinics whose
purpose is to provide individualized psychological treatment for the
student, and teachers must become psychological therapists." It also
follows closely the HAWAII MASTER PLAN FOR EDUCATION which states
that, "all classrooms must now be considered "mental health
clinicians", and all students must be regarded as 'patients.'" Not
only was this a plan of the 70's, but it is also in the schools of the
80's.</p>

<p> 2. <ent type='ORG'>THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION</ent> &amp; NATIONAL TRAINING
LABORATORY</p>

<p> "<ent type='ORG'>The Carnegie</ent> Report on Teachers" - (funded by our tax dollars) "A
new national (non government) board with a majority of outstanding
teachers would be created to set standards for the profession and
prepare a national certifying examination for teachers comparable to
the <ent type='ORG'>BAR</ent> and other professional exams. <ent type='ORG'>The Carnegie</ent> Corporation
proposes to finance the groundwork and research necessary to make such
a board operational." ( N.E.A. president 1986,<ent type='PERSON'>Mary Hatwood Futrell</ent>)
This in itself is not bad until we understand what the worlds most
powerful lobbying force, The N.E.A. is pushing. - Their goals include:</p>

<p> - TOTAL CONTROL OF <ent type='ORG'>TEXTBOOKS</ent> AND <ent type='ORG'>CURRICULUM</ent> (which means content
determined by the N.E.A. and not by school boards) - SEX EDUCATION
WITHOUT PARENTAL CHOICE OR REVIEW. - CONTROL OVER ALL TEACHERS,
COLLEGES, AND ACCREDITING. - LAWS AGAINST THE "VOUCHER SYSTEM" THAT
WOULD ALLOW THE PARENTS TO CHOOSE AMONG PUBLIC SCHOOLS. Do the
teachers really support the .E.A. system??? And does it make any
difference what teachers or the public want? You judge!</p>

<p> The N.E.A. leadership supports the decriminalization of marijuana,
while 76% of the N.E.A. members do not.The N.E.A. leaders promote
preferential treatment for homosexuals, while 69% of the membership
does not.</p>

<p> The N.E.A. leadership opposes public school teaching the Biblical
account of creation while 60% of the members support it.</p>

<p> The N.E.A. favors busing to achieve "racial balance", while nearly
70% oppose busing. (taken from : Focus On The Family magazine 9/88)</p>

<p> As early as 1962 (the year prayer was taken out of our schools) the
N.E.A. had a manual published: The N.E.A Teachers Training Manual(used
to train teachers). Quote: "Human relations training fits into a
context of institutional influence procedures which includes COERCIVE
PERSUASION in the form of THOUGHT REFORM or BRAINWASHING as well as a
MULTITUDE of LESS COERCIVE, INFORMAL PATTERNS. Suspending all
judgement for the time being, this INFLUENCE MODEL is presented in
terms of its capability to make sense of what we know of the CHANGE
PROCESS. It is useful to make meaningful predictions about the
training conditions necessary for the creative growth of both
individuals and organizations. (From the N.E.A. and the National
Training Laboratory)</p>

<p> These organizations are taking naive college students and
indoctrinating them and eventually the whole school system, into their
false <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> philosophy. And of course not all are going to go along
with this but think about it for a minute. Those who will not go
along with the agenda will eventually be pressured, ridiculed, and
weeded out if they don't conform.</p>

<p> Can this really happen? Let's look at the next section.</p>

<p> 3. THE ORGANIZATION FOR RE-EDUCATING TEACHERS</p>

<p> From <ent type='PERSON'>Dee Dickinson</ent> who is the founder of <ent type='ORG'>New Horizons for Learning</ent>:
Quote:</p>

<p> "Already, throughout <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States, positive educational change
is underway and successes are becoming more visible. The next step
needs to be the growing awareness that this kind of educational
success is possible for all students and teachers."</p>

<p> What is she talking about? From <ent type='ORG'>the Seattle Post</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Intellegencer</ent>
2/17/87: The Headline- 'Nation should take note of <ent type='PERSON'>Gardner</ent> education
reform plan, expert says' (The expert is <ent type='ORG'>the Carnegie</ent> Foundation)
Quote: "The U.S. economy will be in serious trouble unless education
systems undergo major reform and Gov. Booth Gardner's plan to do that
puts <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> at the forefront, <ent type='ORG'>Carnegie Forum</ent> director <ent type='PERSON'>Mark Tucker</ent>
says." "But for the plan to succeed, all the pieces must be approved,
he said. Those pieces include higher pay and a master's degree
requirement for teachers and responsibility and accountability to
match." (Ed. note: people did not need to be 'accountable' in the past
and wouldn't dream of doing half a job but now with our value system
being eroded we need 'accountability'.)</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Tucker</ent> contends that the need for a master's degree is more than
mere course work. Courses that are "Intellectually Tough" are needed
so that teachers are truly professionals and the master's degree will
reassure the public that the teachers deserve the greater
responsibility they'll have.. What are they teaching our teachers
that is so "intellectually tough"? And what are they teaching our
teachers today in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> State besides the basic reading, writing
and arithmetic?</p>

<p> IV. THE FORMING OF THE NEW BABYLON (The winning of a generation)</p>

<p> The next section will help describe the curriculum change toward a
new religion and <ent type='LOC'>the New</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>The Heritage Institute</ent> has a
master's degree program in education which was designed in cooperation
with leaders of the <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> Association and <ent type='ORG'>New Horizons</ent>
for Learning(<ent type='PERSON'>Dee Dickinson</ent>). This is through <ent type='ORG'>Antioch University</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>Seattle</ent>, founded in 1975. Some courses offered include:</p>

<p> 1."Nurturing the Human Spirit in the Classroom."- Quote: "This is
an experiential class. Participants will experience at least 10
processes that may be used in their classrooms. This is a workshop
which acknowledges the necessity to nurture the spirits of teachers
first so that they may in turn nurture those of their students."
<ent type='ORG'>Humanistic Astrology</ent> can be used as a key to understanding one's
psychological make-up, and is a valuable tool for knowing how a person
learns, feels, and acts." (They used the word "science", and not
religion here, plus giving acceptance of how a person supposedly
learns, feels, and acts through the astrological birth date signs.)</p>

<p> a. <ent type='ORG'>Schools</ent> in the State of <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>: CHINA curriculum in the
classroom If the teachers are being taught <ent type='ORG'>Astrology</ent> as a science, are
these practices being taught in the classroom? The answer is YES!
This is being taught through the history class, the math class, and
social studies class. The teachers are introduced into this through
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> State <ent type='ORG'>Schools</ent> CHINA curriculum. This curriculum manual is
funded by <ent type='ORG'>the National Institute</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> for the State of
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>the Superintendent</ent> of Public <ent type='ORG'>Schools</ent>.(printed in 1984 &amp;
reprinted in 1988) <ent type='PERSON'>Frank</ent> B. <ent type='PERSON'>Brouillet</ent> was the superintendent of
schools when this was introduced. The math and social studies courses
both use the zodiac chart: example: What sign are you? Subject area:
<ent type='ORG'>Math Drill</ent>; Social Studies</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Lev</ent>el : Elementary</p>

<p> Objectives : To practice using reference charts to find information
- To learn to calculate age or year of birth if one or the other is
given - To become familiar with the astrological Zodiac and the animal
cycles and understand their similarities and differences Through this
teaching they are familiarizing the children with <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> Religion
which is illegal. (If we can't teach <ent type='NORP'>Christianity</ent>, they can't teach
their religion.)</p>

<p> 3. THE OCCULT AND THE SCHOOL CAMPUS</p>

<p> How popular are other religions and the occult with our elementary
schools up through the college campuses? "Book sales of satanism and
occult practices (ex: satanic bible) are out selling two to one the
Holy Bible in most college towns. In some places these books are
selling at a hundred to one. Since about 1967, there has been a rapid
increase in the publication of occult books. Some libraries do not
even stock occult books anymore, because practicing occultists steal
them so rapidly, and it costs too much to replace them." a.
"<ent type='ORG'>Witchcraft</ent> started in the school system across the nation in 1970."
"...witchcraft is being taught as an official course or as part of a
lecture series in public schools all across the country under a
variety of course titles, including the 'Literature of the
Supernatural'." A brief survey was done showing that more than 50% of
the nations public schools had introduced students to witchcraft in
one form or another. How can they promote witchcraft in the schools?
Because very few parents have objected to the courses or even know
they are being taught, because they don't take an interest in what's
happening in the schoolroom anymore."</p>

<p> b. How is this affecting our schools and teachers in the State of
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>? In 1986 a brochure from the Community <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> Dept at
<ent type='ORG'>Antioch University</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Seattle</ent> was sent to school teachers. In this
brochure, "Women and Spirituality", they were advertising a
conference: "Defining Our Commonalty Celebrating Our Diversity" The
introduction statement included: " Let there be room for those of us
who have found a home for our spirit in the church, in the synagogue,
in the ashram, in nature; in the company of family, alone, or in the
company of other women.Let us find a way to meet: in dialogue,
meditation, ritual, prayer and celebration. As <ent type='PERSON'>Merida Wexler</ent>
suggests: "in beauty all around us, let us begin." Some of the
workshops are: " Liberating Ourselves and Others Through Our
Sexuality"- " This workshop is designed to discover how God's
revelation in Sexuality the world comes alive through our acceptance
and celebration of both our own sexuality(whether Lesbian,
Heterosexual, or Bisexual) and that of other women. "Women's Ritual:
Women's Bonding"-(The instructor is <ent type='PERSON'>Miriam Starhawk</ent>)"</p>

<p> The day itself is structured as a ritual, a sacred time and space
we create by invoking the four elements-air, fire, water and earth,
which correspond to mind, energy, emotions and body. We bring all
these aspects of ourselves to encounter the Goddess in her three
aspects and to learn from each. ...The <ent type='ORG'>Crone</ent> teaches us about power -
how to weave our groups together in ways that share power and
encourage each of us to take our power, to confront our fears and move
beyond our limitations, to take action that reshapes the world."
(Starhawk refers to the word 'Goddesses';We know them as witches
[sic].)</p>

<p> "Visions of the Goddesses":</p>

<p> "This workshop will be an intensive personal exploration of ancient
Mediterranean Goddess imagery Through slides, guided meditation,
journal writing, myth-making and ritual creation. Please bring a
journal and an object which symbolizes your connection to your female
ancestors or to the earth."</p>

<p> "The Holy Prostitute": Heretical Archetype for Healing the Nuclear Age- "The original whore was a priestess, the conduit to the divine,
the one who cleansed the masculine of the blood on his hands. In
contemporary times, her practice is considered an abomination while
nature is divided from spirit, body divided from mind, and man from
woman; nature, body and woman are all defiled by the very philosophies
which purport to elevate consciousness." "Reclaiming Our Power":
"Magic, Sex and Politics"-</p>

<p> "<ent type='PERSON'>Patriarchal</ent> religion teaches that God is found outside the world,
that spirit is separate from matter. That split devalues the flesh,
the material world, nature, sexuality, and women. It gives rise to a
society based on power-over, on domination and exploitation. Yet
there is a different principle of power, based on an awareness of all
things alive, inherently valuable, sacred and interrelated. This
awareness infuses the earth-based spiritual traditions of <ent type='LOC'>Africa</ent>,
Native <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, and the ancient European religions of the Goddess.
Its resurgence today is part of a broad movement for change in the
underlying structure of society."</p>

<p> Other workshops were: Rituals: Creating Sacred Space Ritual as
Therapy, Healing and Soul, The Goddesses of Ancient Egypt, The
Goddesses of Ancient Egypt We Are Women Giving Birth to Ourselves
<ent type='PERSON'>Miriam Starhawk</ent> who is one of the instructors is one of the world's
most politically active and important witches [sic]. (She calls them
goddesses) She is a high priestess in a major coven and has been
politically active in both the witches [sic] / neo-pagan [sic]
movements as well as the feminist movement. She is a frequent speaker
at <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> convocations and conferences. (Cumby, Constance - A planned
deception; p.139 (If you don't think there is power in witchcraft I'll
suggest some books, or talk to you later)</p>

<p> To briefly recap the material presented so far, I would remind you
of <ent type='ORG'>the International</ent>, National and local movements bringing in <ent type='LOC'>the New</ent>
Age movement to our school system through the Tri-University project,
<ent type='ORG'>BSTEP</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>National Education</ent> Association, the National Training
Laboratory, and now a masters degree program. All of these
organizations and projects involve the movement away from academics,
and the reforming our values through behavior curriculums. The plans
presented emphasize control over our educators and the students, along
with control over all curriculum to leader, economy, and religion.
The movement is very subtle, so as not to alarm the people with
massive changes, but rather through gradualism gain acceptance of
ideas while expanding them into the deeper roots of their New <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent>.
The taking away of <ent type='NORP'>Judeo</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> values and replacing them with
values that support the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> philosophy did not happen over night.
It began in 1962 when prayer was taken out of the schools, equalling
the removal of God, and you will remember the N.E.A. Teachers Training
Manual which included the use of influence procedures for using
brainwashing techniques was published in 1962. So this has been on
going for almost 30 years now.</p>

<p> V.EXAMPLES OF A VALUELESS SCHOOL SYSTEM</p>

<p> NO <ent type='ORG'>ABSOLUTES</ent> IS A ABSOLUTE!!</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Lou Tice</ent>, founder of <ent type='ORG'>Pacific Institute</ent> and a <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> leader, "NEW
Age concepts try to provide you with important life-changing tools
which are said to enable you to achieve whatever you truly want to
achieve now and for the rest of your life". From a classes schedule
for a voctech school in the state of <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>." Stir Your Creative
Genius:. Send your critic on vacation! Experiment, take risks and
experience your creative genius in a safe, playful atmosphere. We'll
explore freeflow writing, guided imagery, mind-mapping,
brain-storming, etc. ..." " Self-Hypnosis: Weight control, stress
management, habit elimination and creativity are some issues that can
be dealt with though self-hypnosis...." " Creative
Visualization/Imaging" what is meant by all of this? Does it all
work? And where does the guide imagery come from? And is this all
<ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> and occult?</p>

<p> In THE INNER CLASSROOM: TEACHING WITH GUIDE IMAGERY. by Dr. Jack
Canfield, M.Ed.. <ent type='PERSON'>Jack Canfield</ent> is a past-president of the Association
for Humanistic <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> and has been a consultant to over 100 school
system, universities and mental health organizations." Classroom
atmosphere:</p>

<p> 1. Creating a safe space: When students are participating in a
guide imagery experience they are in an altered state of
consciousness. Their brain wave activity is slowed down... " Under
rules " 5 ... occasionally a student will have a scary image. They
need to know that you will be there to comfort them if they do" "6
Students may go on a detour fantasy to a favorite place if they find
the imagery becomes scary or evokes uncomfortable feelings."</p>

<p> "the Law of up and down: whenever you take a student up in a
imagery experience (vie stairs, escalators, magic carpets, a balloon,
magic, etc.), you will be encouraging the student to move into a
higher level of consciousness which is generally associated with
emotional and spiritual up-liftment... inner wisdom...ect. On the
other hand, taking a student down( via stairs, escalators, submarines,
tunnels, and below the sea) will more likely take the student down
into the lower unconscious part of the mind, which is more associate
with negative emotions, the past, repressed traumatic experiences,
unresolved conflicts, repressed aspects of the personality, darkness,
monsters and fear. It is therefor a good idea to avoid taking
students down below the ground unless you have a clear psychological
purpose and are adequately trained in psychodramatic techniques of
counseling such as gestalt, transactional analysis, psychosynthesis or
neurolinguistic programming.It is therefor a good idea to avoid taking

<p> The next section refers to a portion of my personal testimony and
the testimony of others. Some will remain unnamed due to the nature
of the testimony but everything is documented.Having been raised in
the occult from a very early age we were teaching others how to teach
occult practices to others. Of the many groups who came to us, a
number were school teachers, but not as a group, just individuals.</p>

<p> When prayer and the Bible were taken out of the schools in 1962,
the moral law was removed as well. Lawlessness set in and a wave of
unruliness in the classroom. Not understanding that the Bible and God
were the moral standards, teachers were looking to bring some order
and interest in learning back to the classroom. <ent type='ORG'>Mind sciences</ent> became
an avenue to reach not only the child's mind intellectually, but even
to touch their emotions and will. Those techniques included,different
types of meditation, visualization through guided imagery exorcizes,
as well as stress reduction. Once learned, they became a way of life,
not just for the teacher but also for the student which gives both the
teacher and student no absolutes for the sky is the limit. If you can
visualize it you can have it.</p>

<p> What happens to the kid who does not achieve what he visualizes?
This is what happened to me from my personal testimony.</p>

<p> "I was out of control; by this I mean, with no absolutes I was up
when I got to my goals. But when I did not achieve my goals, I was
way down to the point of suicide. You see when you add peer pressure
to achieve, the child has no way to save face when they don't make the
goal.( You wonder why the suicide rate is going up in school age
children).</p>

<p> I was shocked to learn how blatant and how early in the child's
life they are starting the programming for achieving their goals.</p>

<p> a. From a day care run through a church there were found
subliminal records teaching basic meditation techniques to toddlers at
rest time, and visualization under the guise of reinforcing what they
are learning about colors, shapes, animals etc., etc.. Titles
include; SEA GULLS...MUSIC FOR REST AND RELAXATION, WITCHES' BREW POT
FULL OF SONGS FOR ORAL LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. Albums come from the same
company, <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent>al Activities, Inc. Box 392 Freeport, N.Y. 11520 (I
don't know whether or not they know what they are really promoting)</p>

<p> b. A fourth grader was assigned to fill out an application called
<ent type='ORG'>Witch and Warlock</ent> [sic] around Halloween. Some of the questions
included; "Professional name(do not use real name), What was your past
experience?, To cast a spell, you must develop your own incantation.
What will be yours?, Who is your favorite witch [sic]?, Are you
willing to work with vampires? <ent type='ORG'>Monsters</ent>? The bottom of the paper had
this: Your application will be examined, and if you qualify, you will
be promptly notified." (Fun and games? Lets see the progression of
acceptance toward satanism.)</p>

<p> c. An <ent type='GPE'>Oregon</ent> high school student was asked to write a spell for a
composition class. (not Halloween) [Where do you think this leads
impressionable, and inquisitive young minds?]</p>

<p> d The following is a required reading assignment in the Snohomish
School Dist. three to four times a week.</p>

<p> Prologue:</p>

<p> " Being a History of the War of the Gods and the Acts of Belgarath
the Sorcerer.' "When the world was new, the seven gods dwelt in
harmony, and the races of man were as one people. <ent type='GPE'>Belar</ent>, youngest of
the gods, was beloved by the <ent type='PERSON'>Alorns</ent>. He abode with them and cherished
them, and they prospered in his care. The other godds also gathered
peoples about them, and each god cherished his own people." "But
Belar's eldest brother, <ent type='PERSON'>Aldur</ent>, was god over no people. He dwelt apart
from men and gods, until the day that a vagrant child sought him out.
<ent type='PERSON'>Aldur</ent> accepted the child as his disciple and called him Belgarath.
Belgarath learned the secret of the Will and the Word and became a
sorcerer. In the years that followed, others also sought out the
solitary god. They joined in brotherhood to learn at the feet of
<ent type='PERSON'>Aldur</ent>, and time did not touch them." "Now it happened that <ent type='PERSON'>Aldur</ent> took
up a stone in the shape of a globe, no larger than the heart of a
child, and he turned the stone in his hand until it became a living
soul. The power of the living jewel, which men called the Orb of
<ent type='PERSON'>Aldur</ent>, was very great, and <ent type='PERSON'>Aldur</ent> worked wonders with it."</p>

<p> "Of all the gods, <ent type='PERSON'>Torak</ent> was the most beautiful, and his people were
the <ent type='ORG'>Angaraks</ent>. They burned sacrifices before him, calling him Lord of
Lords, and <ent type='PERSON'>Torak</ent> found the smell of sacrifice and the words of
adoration sweet. The day came, however, when he heard of the Orb of
<ent type='PERSON'>Aldur</ent>, and from that moment he knew no peace." The story goes on and
is an excellent example of fantasy given to children which promotes
satanism.</p>

<p> e "By age 13, <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> fit every police description of an occultist: he
was intelligent, didn't live up to his potential, and had come from an
abusive home, loveless home. Being only a teenager, <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> confused the
money and power he desired with "love", and sought witchcraft to meet
his need for self-affirmation." "At age 16, <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> was conjuring up
spirits to assume physical form and follow the coven's orders to
"wreak whatever havoc they desired." This particular coven, which has
since expanded throughout southern <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>, met in obscure places
and used codes for their internal communication, to evade police."
John's coven practiced "homosexual tantra"(sex magic) and had little
interest in making human or animal sacrifices. <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> eventually left
the group at 19 and, when interviewed at 23, said he remembered
instances where other covens "took members out" for telling group
secrets. These victims were usually stabbed to death and their bodies
burned. Throughout his years as a self-proclaimed sorcerer, <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> said
he never witnessed a ritual murder. But his interest in <ent type='PERSON'>Satan</ent>ism took
it's toll on his life in other ways. The young man lives in fear of
being discovered by members of his old coven, who wouldn't think twice
about making a public-if not gory-example of his desertion."</p>

<p> f. "DEVIL WORSHIPING KIDS SHOCKING CONFESSION : WE KILLED CHICKENS,
DOGS, CATS--AND A TEENAGE GIRL-- TO PLEASE <ent type='PERSON'>Satan</ent>!" "Two teenage devil
worshipers were trying to please <ent type='PERSON'>Satan</ent> when they ate the eyeballs and
innards of animals they slaughtered - and sacrificed a beautiful
teenage girl. After swearing on a Bible to tell the truth, cult
leader <ent type='PERSON'>Terry Belcher</ent>, 16, told a shocked jury how he and <ent type='PERSON'>Robert</ent>
McIntyre strangled <ent type='PERSON'>Theresa Simmons</ent>, 17, and performed a crude ritual
over her lifeless body. Cult members who refused to participate in
the gruesome ceremony were beaten. The rituals were performed for
power, a ritual, the taste of blood, <ent type='PERSON'>Belcher</ent> testified. I got money,
power, sex, drugs, anything I wanted, he said. It was easier to get
em. It was like <ent type='PERSON'>Satan</ent> helped you get'em. The two boys strangled her
with a leather bootlace after getting psyched up listening to heavy

approached by a coven offering protection by magic and witchcraft. In
the year and a half that she was in the coven, she started through sex
initiation, animal sacrifices, eating parts of the sacrifices, and
finally was to participate in human sacrifice. She was slated to be a
breeder of babies for sacrifices to <ent type='PERSON'>Satan</ent>. All sacrifices were done
to rock music and chanting. (<ent type='PERSON'>Pink Floyd</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Ozzy Osbourne</ent>) When asked how
many kids from her school participated in coven activity she replied,
"25% at least".</p>

<p> j. In the CHINA <ent type='ORG'>MOSAIC</ent>: MULTIDISCIPLINARY UNITS FOR THE MIDDLE
GRADES PUT OUT BY THE OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.
ON PAGE 28, UNIT <ent type='NORP'>Monkey</ent> Tales:Grade <ent type='PERSON'>Lev</ent>el, 4th through 7th.
Objective: Student will:1, discover some aspects of Chinese
traditional literature and culture. 2, recognize that animal stories
are popular in many cultures. 3, make replicas of Chinese fold
puppets. 4, dramatize "<ent type='NORP'>Monkey</ent> Tales". Materials: 1, Teacher's copy of
"<ent type='NORP'>Monkey</ent> Subdues the White-Boned Demon"</p>

<p> Teacher Background: The characters are mainly spirits, animals, and
monsters, and their adventure are full of drama and humor. Four main
characters embark on the journey to the west. The first, <ent type='PERSON'>Xuan Zang</ent>,
is based on a monk who made the perilous trip from <ent type='GPE'>China</ent> to India in
the seveth century to collect and study <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent> scriptures. After
staying in India for seventeen years he returned to <ent type='GPE'>China</ent> to translate
the scripture. He is a kindly and sincere figure in the novel. The
main character is actually <ent type='PERSON'>Xuan Zang</ent>'s disciple, <ent type='NORP'>Monkey</ent>. He is
cunning, mischievous, fearless, irrepressible, and loyal. The second
disciple is Pigsy. Pigsy is stupid and greedy and often finds himself
the butt of jokes, by he is faithful in times of danger. The third
disciple, <ent type='PERSON'>Sandy</ent>, is a fallen god in donkey form. Although he looks
ferocious, he does not play a major part in the adventures.</p>

<p> Through the above examples, an attempt has been made to expose the
momentum toward the <ent type='PERSON'>Occult</ent> due to <ent type='NORP'>Judeo</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> values being taken
out of our educational system.Although these examples are the leading
edge of the effects of the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> movement on kids, not everyone
being influenced will fall into this extreme. The teachers who have
moral standards and values will express these through their lessons
and de-emphasize what they do not agree with. But the curriculum can
be spread out and very subtle so that even those who teach do not
catch on to the planned results of the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> movement.</p>

<p> There are many teachers who still hold to the standards and values
of God who do not have <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> as their savior. They don't have the
power to overcome this movement but those who have <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> Christ as
their Lord can. These teachers must seek deliverance for their kids
from the <ent type='PERSON'>Antichrist</ent> through prayer. Some teachers help to curb the
degeneration of the next generation of kids, but I'm afraid that the
educational process is converting more and more teachers to <ent type='LOC'>the New</ent>
Age movement through their cleverly devised strategies. These
teachers are a generation, and will be creating a generation, for the
coming <ent type='PERSON'>Antichrist</ent> and his prophet as was foretold in the Holy Bible.</p>

<p> SCHOOLS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY <ent type='ORG'>CURRICULUM</ent></p>

<p> The following is out of a 5th grade teachers manual. [Positive
Action Program] OVERVIEW: Positive action is used to pry into personal
life. - "Students may use POSITIVE ACTION as opportunity to talk about
their homes and families or real life situations that are frightening,
dangerous, or illegal. Respect confidence, but be prepared to ask for
professional support and assistance if necessary." (page xiii) -
"POSITIVE ACTION is intended to be a psychological behavior change
curriculum. If lessons are taught right, behavior changes should be
evident in all students." - "POSITIVE ACTION allows children to choose
for themselves what is best." (Ed. note: This teaches <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> values
and how to control and manipulate students.In lesson three the parent
is looked on as a hindrance to the development of the child.The
question 'WHO AM I?' is given the answer of being 'self' centered.
And 'self' is God.</p>

<p> A COMPARISON OF THE POSITIVE ACTION VALUES WITH CHRISTIAN VALUES.
POSITIVE ACTION CHRISTIAN</p>

<p> 3 needs-- physical emotional - mental physical - emotional
spiritual</p>

<p> School 1st. Then family God 1st Family 2nd</p>

<p> Self-centered Christ-centered - No absolutes Absolutes based on
Biblical</p>

<p> principles. (i.e.10 Commandments)</p>

<p> Teaches the choice is Honesty no matter what the cost determined
from the outcome. (If I lie, I won't get caught) Teaches conditional
love-God loves us unconditionally based on positive actions</p>

<p> Anger is discouraged Righteous anger against sin is ok.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Positive Action</ent> is another example of using <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> philosophies
for be behavior education over academic excellence In the Positive
Action Principles manual an outline for responding to the common
complaints parents have regarding the program is given. The list of
complaints are:</p>

<p> That <ent type='ORG'>Positive Action</ent> and "similar programs" usurp parents
authority.</p>

<p> That <ent type='ORG'>Positive Action</ent> is a values (or values clarification) program.</p>

<p> That <ent type='ORG'>Positive Action</ent> is presenting ideas that should be presented
at home or in church.</p>

<p> That <ent type='ORG'>Positive Action</ent> uses money that should be spent on "the
basics"--reading, writing, and arithmetic.</p>

<p> That <ent type='ORG'>Positive Action</ent> is secular/humanistic education.</p>

<p> Another curriculum in the 21st Century schools is the <ent type='GPE'>China</ent>
curriculum. This has already been adopted throughout the school
districts. This curriculum brings <ent type='ORG'>Astrology</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> religion to
the student. The Multicultural and Equity <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> is really
designed to introduce all religions and value behaviors as acceptable.
They are setting this generation up for a fall to the one world
government, leader, and religion.</p>

<p> These programs are designed to question and break down our value
systems but they are not presented in that light. Rather it is
portrayed as helping people to get along with people, and non
discrimination against different races, etc. These in themselves are
great ideals. It's when they are gradually hooked up with homosexual,
and lesbian lifestyles, pornography, eastern religious practices and
<ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> philosophies that the destruction of our society is immanent.
<ent type='NORP'>Christians</ent> are not allowed their views or activities in the classroom,
but the ushering in of a new religion, government, and economy is OK.
Getting along with one another is fine but the curriculums are
designed to let in destructive values to our society that are
objectionable.</p>

<p> As you heard, the curriculum being sold the school districts come
with the arguments parents raise. It is the principle's
responsibility to defend these programs and hope that many parents
don't show up complaining. They have used the story of not
understanding the parent saying 'no one else has complained'. They
have used this story even if many have complained. It doesn't take
many people to steer a ship and cause it to go the direction they
desire as long as everything is in place and the crew follows orders.
I wonder how many educators would obey the orders if they new where
the ship of education is being steered. A person who heard me on the
radio one day sent me a letter. She wrote: "The former Superintendent
of Public <ent type='ORG'>Schools</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Albuquerque</ent>, N.M., Dr. Lillian C. <ent type='PERSON'>Barna</ent>, was
hired in May of 1988 as the new Superintendent for the <ent type='GPE'>Tacoma</ent> School
Dist. I would not have been aware of this except that my husband is a
teacher in <ent type='GPE'>Tacoma</ent> and mentioned it to me after reading this article."
The article referred to comes from Focus On The Family magazine. (July
88) THEY TEACH NEW AGE IN <ent type='GPE'>NEW MEXICO</ent>'S SCHOOLS [One mother's campaign
against mysticism, occultism, astrologers, palm readers and <ent type='NORP'>Tibetan</ent>
monks.]</p>

<p> "<ent type='PERSON'>Susan Gurule</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Albuquerque</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>New Mexico</ent> has learned some difficult
lessons about her local school system." "It has been more than two
years now since she discovered that her children were being introduced
to eastern meditation techniques and <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> thought by an elementary
school councillor." "Since that time, she has been fighting it. The
battle is far from won, but there have been significant victories
along the way.</p>

<p> "The Battle Begins" In February 1986, <ent type='PERSON'>Susan</ent> discovered her son was
being frightened by strange stories he was hearing at school. After
carefully questioning him, she learned that every other week he was
being sent to the counselor's office, and told to lie on the floor.
He was taught to breathe deeply and to meditate as he listened to a
series of guided fantasy tapes." "Just two weeks before learning all
this, <ent type='PERSON'>Susan</ent> had been reading <ent type='PERSON'>Phyllis Schlafly</ent>'s book, 'Child Abuse in
the Classroom', so she was aware of <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> practices in public
schools. But she was unaware that her own school district was
involved."</p>

<p> "As she investigated, she also learned that her older daughter had
already been learning meditation techniques for over two years-without
Susan's consent or knowledge. And her outrage increased when she
discovered her son and daughter had been told to keep the counseling
sessions a secret."</p>

<p> "<ent type='PERSON'>Susan</ent> contacted her son's teacher to find out why he was being
sent to counseling. She was told that all of the children were
learning techniques supposedly designed to increase self-esteem,
feelings of belonging, and reading comprehension." "She took her
objections to the school counselor who assured her nothing was wrong
with meditation. The councilor asked, 'Why do you object to your
children emptying their minds?' At that point, says <ent type='PERSON'>Susan</ent>, 'Our
relationship deteriorated and I didn't want my children in the same
room with that counselor'."</p>

<p> "After listening to the guided fantasy tapes, <ent type='PERSON'>Susan</ent> realized they
were promoting transcendental meditation, a westernized form of
<ent type='NORP'>Hinduism</ent>, as well as occultic practices, including astral projection."</p>

<p> "The program being used to teach children to meditate is called
Developing Understanding of Self &amp; Others(<ent type='ORG'>DUSO</ent>), published by <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>
Guidance Service, St. <ent type='PERSON'>Paul</ent> Minn. This particular program contains 42
guided imagery lessons."</p>

<p> "As she researched the <ent type='ORG'>DUSO</ent> program, <ent type='PERSON'>Susan</ent> discovered another form
of guided imagery being used with gifted children in <ent type='GPE'>Albuquerque</ent>
schools. 'Flights of Fantasy' trains children to imagine meeting
strange creatures in space and encourages the children to merge with
them before returning to earth."</p>

<p> "The superintendent of Public <ent type='ORG'>Schools</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Albuquerque</ent>, Dr. Lillian
C. <ent type='PERSON'>Barna</ent>, eventually wrote to <ent type='PERSON'>Susan</ent> and invited her to take Learning
Theory and Child Growth classes to learn more about the counseling
program. She did-and they confirmed her worst fears." ...."She found
an ally in state senator <ent type='PERSON'>Joseph Carraro</ent>... <ent type='PERSON'>Carraro</ent> was outraged at
what he saw occurring under the guise of increasing self-esteem in
children. He eventually led a legislative battle to pass a Senate
resolution condemning the use of transcendental meditation or other
occultic practices in <ent type='GPE'>New Mexico</ent>'s public school system."</p>

<p> " As he sees it, 'people say certain kids are committing suicide
because they've lost their self-esteem....they need to relax more.
They've lost their self-esteem because thy can't read, write and
compete. I have a boy who doesn't need to relax any more. He needs
to read, write and do math, not hum a mantra'."</p>

<p> The legislature approved the measure which condemned <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>
practices in counseling programs. "After passage of the resolution,
educators and the press seemed bent on ridiculing it. In newspaper
accounts of the controversy, educators loudly protested the Senates
action."</p>

<p> Be prepared to receive ridicule if you plan to fight this movement.</p>

<p> Sounds to good to To be true? You're right!</p>

<p> Through eastern mysticism, and no <ent type='ORG'>ABSOLUTES</ent> or value system, our
society is being changed to accept the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> answers. The
hysterical part of this is that the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> philosophy created the
problems that they are now trying to solve. So now <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>rs can be
heroes in developing answers to the problems they've created.</p>

<p> With the only true God who gave us the social structures,
government structures, family structures, and individual standards,
the problems cease to exist when these standards are followed.</p>

<p> Without the structures God gave and with a value system being
destroyed by <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> thinking, we see the increase in alcoholism, drug
abuse, sexual immorality, all of which leads to higher divorce rates,
which leads to the breakdown of the family and the love everyone
needs. When the family unit dissolves the destructive cycle increases
and propagates itself.</p>

<p> In order to bring this home to you, consider the teacher in the
<ent type='GPE'>Tacoma</ent> School Dist. who is now offering an accredited course for
teachers through U.PS. The course is '<ent type='ORG'>Teaching for</ent> Social
Responsibility' and instructed by <ent type='PERSON'>Lee Landrud</ent>. The course is promoted
like this:</p>

<p> feel connected</p>

<p> see different viewpoints</p>

<p> think critically</p>

<p> resolve conflicts so all win</p>

<p> responsibly make decisions</p>

<p> become agents of peaceful change</p>

<p> cooperate in team learning</p>

<p> learn meditation skills</p>

<p> Quote: " We can enable students to feel they have responsibility,
power, and ability to influence their world. The goals of this course
are to explore ways of helping our students to</p>

<p> The <ent type='GPE'>Tacoma</ent> teacher, <ent type='PERSON'>Lee Landrud</ent>, is building a library of varied
and field-tested curriculum materials and makes these available to
teachers. Where is the field testing of these curriculums taking
place? Your school? [remember the subliminal records used in the Day
Care Program bringing subliminal messages and progressive relaxation
techniques?]</p>

<p> The <ent type='GPE'>Tacoma</ent> freshman health class requirements include: "Learning to
Relax". "simple technique for reducing stress is the progressive
relaxation technique. See the <ent type='ORG'>Health</ent> handbook.."</p>

<p> To get a picture of how this outline hooks up the curriculum with
<ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> religions, consider YOGA, the essence of spirituality for all
<ent type='NORP'>Hinduism</ent>.</p>

<p> To the <ent type='NORP'>Hindu</ent>, the circle of reincarnation is punishment and
suffering that they must escape. Their goal is to break this vicious
cycle through YOGA. YOGA means: yoke, or union with God.</p>

<p> Kundalini Yoga is the serpent force which they believe is coiled at
the base of the spine. <ent type='NORP'>Western</ent>ers don't use the term 'serpent' but
rather use the term 'energy'. The goal is to force the serpent force
through the chakras, or the spines psychic channels, releasing the
kundalini force within us to receive psychic powers and become divine.</p>

<p> Raja Yoga, or meditation of the mind, is to look into ones self to
find the true self and in finding true self is finding God. This
uniting with God is understood better by knowing that the guru's are
considered Christ or the Christ Spirit incarnate. But in <ent type='PERSON'>Matthew</ent>
24:23-24 <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> gives us warning about false <ent type='NORP'>Christs</ent>.</p>

<p> The Mantra is a word, usually a <ent type='NORP'>Hindu</ent> god, given by a Yoga master
to chant. This is used to clear the mind to become united with the so
called deities which are really demons. The purpose in their minds is
to become united with God to realize that we are really God.</p>

<p> In <ent type='ORG'>the Tacoma School Dist</ent>. health program is the chapter called:
"Stages in Accepting Death."Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, a psychiatrist, has
worked with hundreds of dying patients and their families. She has
tried to better understand what a person goes through in coming to
grips with his or her own death." To understand the true Elizabeth
Kubler-Ross and know what she's teaching, the book Unholy Sacrifices
of the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> gives us examples.</p>

<p> She says, "This work with dying patients has also helped me to find
my own religious identity, to know that there is life after death and
to know that we will be reborn again one day in order to complete the
tasks we have not been able or willing to complete in this lifetime."</p>

<p> Kubler-Ross not only believes in reincarnation but, as a
<ent type='NORP'>Universalist</ent>, believes that everyone goes to Heaven (when pinned down
to specifics on national television, she said that Adolf <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> was in
Heaven.Do you see the connection between <ent type='NORP'>Hinduism</ent>,Yoga and the
curriculum the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> movement has been promoting?</p>

<p> The educators have been deceived through a carefully devised plan
to take over our society and culture. In 1966 at <ent type='ORG'>the International</ent>
<ent type='NORP'>Hindu</ent> Conference a strategy was devised by leading Hindu's to convert
the world. TM was chosen to counter the 'demon' of <ent type='NORP'>Christianity</ent>. The
guru's were the 1st line of attack and they in turn influenced the
music world. The <ent type='ORG'>Beetles</ent> were the 1st major band with a world wide
audience to promote the doctrines of the guru's. The strategy seems
to have infiltrated all areas of society and have become the ambition
of the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>rs to indoctrinate a whole generation to usher in their
New</p>

<p> VI. USE AND ABUSE OF POWER AND INFLUENCE</p>

<p> Teachers who have <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> in their lives seem to emphasize only the
positive values of God in the curriculums and de-emphasize <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>
philosophy. But the teachers who have no understanding of the
conflict of beliefs being fought in our society are easy targets for
deception. The educators who have already been indoctrinated and
filled with this movement's deceptions will do anything to promote and
fulfill the call upon them as agents of change for the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>
movement.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Marilyn Ferguson</ent> writes in The Aquarian Conspiracy about "what she
found in the deepest roots of our educational system; she quotes:
"There are a lot of us in the woodwork." He was referring to a loose
coalition of conspirators in agencies and on <ent type='ORG'>Congressional</ent> staffs.
Within <ent type='ORG'>the Department</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>Health</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> and Welfare, innovators
have created informal rap groups to share their strategies for
slipping new ideas into a resistant system and to give each other
moral support."</p>

<p> "Concepts that might otherwise appear 'far out' can be given
legitimacy by a single federally funded program. The grant making
apparatus of government determines fashion in some research fields.
This aura of legitimacy is fostered here and there by conspirator-bureaucrats."Some of the research projects that were funded include:
meditation, biofeedback, psychic phenomena, and alternative medical
approaches. ( Funded by <ent type='ORG'>the Dept</ent>. of Defense)</p>

<p> The resistant system that these people refer to comes from a
society that followed as a standard the moral and spiritual guidelines
given in Gods Holy Word. Their strategies to change our culture have
obviously been very effective. We as a nation have been
systematically brainwashed through years of propaganda so that we do
not know how we came to the new understandings that we have accepted
as truth. But I know only one truth that is everlasting in nature and
shall never pass away Brethren, I would ask you to make a stand like
<ent type='PERSON'>Joshua</ent> made when confronting the children of <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent> and their many
gods: " As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord" (<ent type='PERSON'>Joshua</ent> 24:15)</p>

<p> God gave fair warning to the house of <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent> that they should not
serve other gods. His judgement would be upon them for their
transgressions. <ent type='PERSON'>Isaiah</ent> gives us an idea of the judgement of God on
the people for their harlotry to other gods: <ent type='PERSON'>Isaiah</ent> 47:12-14 " Stand
now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries,
wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able
to profit, if so be <ent type='PERSON'>thou mayest</ent> prevail. Thou art wearied in the
multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers,
the monthly prognosticators, stand up and save thee from these things
that shall come upon thee. Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire
shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of
the flame: There shall not be a coal to warm at, not fire to sit
before it."</p>

<p> The globalists pride in their visions have blinded them about the
only true God, and the destruction this is bringing to our youth.
They are so exuberant in their mind games and want to see these
fantasies come about that they are running toward the destruction of
themselves and our society. Unfortunately a few people and groups are
responsible for the agenda in the <ent type='PERSON'>Northwest</ent>,and we are all affected by
them.</p>

<p> In an article: "Where do we go from here", <ent type='PERSON'>Dee Dickinson</ent> says:
"Already, throughout the U.S., positive educational change is underway
and successes are becoming more visible." ( Are these the positive
changes that we are seeing from the few examples above, or the
teaching of our educators")through a new masters degree program
bringing in the occult? All of this is promoted through the schools
for the 21st Century. But note that this is a master plan far higher
than our duped <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> State school system. (Of course we must
realize that the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>rs will imply that <ent type='NORP'>Christians</ent> are duped and
they will not realize that they are helping in bringing about the end
times as described in the book of Revelation. They are pawns in the
hands of their masters, and I believe that most do not know who they
serve.)</p>

<p> Do the above sponsors really know who they support? <ent type='GPE'>Channelers</ent>,
witches, [sic] spiritistic and others? I doubt it. To sum up, I have
attempted to show through international, national, and local levels,
the conspiracy to take us into a <ent type='LOC'>New World</ent> society and religion. They
have been gradually changing our educational system, with the intent
to change a whole generation. There are other parts which put their
vision together, but they are in no hurry to alarm us. They gradually
indoctrinate us with building blocks that tend to build absolute trust
in their followers and acceptance by their user community.</p>

<p> The picture I have drawn seems to be so immense that it's
unstoppable. But I truly believe by turning to God and away from sin
that God will heal our land. My hope is that like <ent type='ORG'>the Kings</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>
there were good and bad Kings. When <ent type='ORG'>the Kings</ent> led the people into
rebellion against God, His judgement came upon the nation of <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>.
But when the king led the people back to God, God restored the people,
land, prosperity, and security to the nation of <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>. And sometimes
God stayed the judgement due the <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>ites while restoration and the
people were humbling themselves before God. We know that the one
world government, one world leader, one world economy, one world
religion will take place in the end times. But God may stay the
judgement against us if we continually seek Him and ask Him for our
people and our land. This may cause revival to take place which turns
our nation around, and stays the end time judgements against us. If
nothing else, may we be as the church of <ent type='GPE'>Philadelphia</ent> in the book of
Revelations. The church of brotherly love didn't have much power, but
loved God and our fellow man.</p>

<p> Action is needed by finding out what your children are being taught
in school and how it lines up with the word of God. Lets become
responsible for our children and their upbringing, not leaving it up
to someone else. Through this outline, I've given you information and
examples to make you aware of the plans for this generation. So above
all prayer, along with fasting to God, to make the way, clear the
path, open the minds and hearts of the educators and the children. We
hope for a change in our educational system and society, to reflect
Godly principles for the salvation of our people and land.</p>

<p> Having been raised in all the disciplines above and more, having
been a channeler from the age of 5 and up, studying under many of the
great disciplines, I still found no peace. I found myself out of
control and no way out but suicide to complete my tasks not obtained
in this life. Not until someone reached out to me, with nail holes in
His hands did I find true peace. <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> Christ. He is the way, the
truth and the life and no one goes to the Father but through Him.
Anyone who tries to go to God in any way, other than the sacrifice of
<ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> Christ, is deceived. To those who may think that God is the
universe and in everything as compared to the creator of the universe
and all things created by Him think about this. The evolutionary
theory encompasses both the agnostic person who doesn't believe in a
god and it is also integral to the 'god is in everything' theologies.
Through the science of facts and not the science of theories, it is
shown that there is not one piece of evidence to prove evolution. It
amazes me to see evolution so widely taught as facts when not even one
piece of evidence has been shown to support the theory. Factual
science on the other hand fits very nicely with the creation story as
told in the Bible.</p>

<p> One example is the showing up of complicated life forms all at once
in the fossil evidence. Not one evolutionary advancement from lower
life forms exists in the fossil record. There is always cause and
effect in everything, and fossil evidence does not support evolution
but it does support creation.</p>

<p> Through the prophets of God came the understanding of a person to
come that was to be the savior of mankind from the eternal judgement
which would be the lake that burns with fire. The lake of fire is
another creation of God's for the rebellion of <ent type='PERSON'>Satan</ent> and his angels
and all who do not have the forgiveness of sin through <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> Christ.</p>

<p> The fulfillment of the prophesies concerning the Christ was shown
in the life and death of <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> the Christ. The love and grace of God
will be shown throughout all eternity by the church, as <ent type='LOC'>the New</ent>
Jerusalem, spoken of in Revelations. Throughout all of Gods creation
there will never be a rebellion against God again throughout eternity.
The lake that burns with fire showing His judgement against rebellion
on one side and the <ent type='GPE'>New Jerusalem</ent> showing his loving kindness to all
who accept and love Him on the other side.</p>

<p> A philosopher by the name of Hegel was the basis of both <ent type='PERSON'>Karl Marx</ent>
in the political and the economics of communism, and Adolf <ent type='PERSON'>Hitler</ent> with
National Socialism. Hegal taught that the state did not have to obey
moral laws or even have to keep agreements. And Well On Planet Earth'
says, "According to the <ent type='NORP'>Hegelian</ent> thought, everything was relative.
This gave man an approach to truth, an approach to life, in which
there were no absolutes, only terms of relativity." "Absolutes are
unchangeable truths from which you can reason from cause to effect.
In relative thinking you are dealing with subjective thought in which
cause and effect have no part. Relativity is based upon
changeableness. When you think in this manner, you say, 'Well, how do
you feel about it now?'"</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Eve</ent>n as the first <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent> had no absolutes through the rebellion
<ent type='ORG'>Nimrod</ent>, so has our society been driven by the forces of the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>
movement into <ent type='LOC'>the New</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent> as foretold in Revelations 17. And in
Revelations 18 the judgement of God is pronounced upon her saying,</p>

<p> "And a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and
threw it into the sea, saying,'Thus will <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent>, the great city, be
thrown down with violence, and will not be found any longer." "And the
sound of harpists and musicians and flute players and trumpeters will
not be heard in you any longer; and no craftsman of any craft will be
found in you any longer; and the sound of a mill will not be heard in
you any longer; and the light of a lamp will not shine in you any
longer; and the voice of the bridegroom and bride will not be heard in
you any longer; for your merchants were the great men of the earth,
because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery. And in her was
found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been
slain on the earth."</p>

<p> And judgement will come to <ent type='LOC'>the New</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent> but the love of God is
shown to His saints through Christ <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent>. As it is written, " That at
the name of <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven,
and on earth, and under the earth, and that every tongue should
confess that <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
(<ent type='PERSON'>Phil</ent> 2:10-11) And then in 1Jn 1:5-10:</p>

<p> "This then is the message which we have heard of Him, and declare
unto you, that God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all. If we
say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie,
and do not the truth: But if we walk in the light, as He is in the
light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent>
Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have no
sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess
our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not
sinned, we make Him a liar, and his word is not in us." (1Jn 1:5-10)</p>

<p> The <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> is essentially all the modern day occult-based
philosophies and practices rolled up in to one world religion. This
wide range of spirt worship, <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> mysticism, Mind-scince religion
and avant-garde psychology. Its essence "oneness" or god-within.
Thus people have to look no further than themselves for all of life's
answers.</p>

<p> AKASHA: Sanskrit, a <ent type='NORP'>Hindu</ent> term meaning the stuff of which the
spiritual realm is composed. It is very sensitive to mental
manipulation. Psychics are believed to be able to "read" the akashic
records and determine what people did in their past lives.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>ASTROLOGY</ent>: One of the most ancient and popular forms of
fortune-telling or divination.Much of the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> is based on
astrological beliefs. It basically is the belief that the position of
stars and planets at the moment of your birth have an effect on one's
destiny.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>AQUARIAN</ent>: Derived from one astrological sign, "<ent type='ORG'>Aquarius</ent>." [sic] New
Age dogma teaches that the older "age" of <ent type='ORG'>Pisces</ent> (another sign) is
coming to an end. It's symbol was the fish, and its keyword was "To
Believe." Hence, <ent type='NORP'>Christianity</ent> was the key religion of the <ent type='NORP'>Piscean</ent>
age. This age is now finishing, to be replaced by the Age of
<ent type='ORG'>Aquarius</ent>, whose keyword is: "To know." Thus, scientific knowledge
will replace faith. This is why so much <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> belief is couched in
pseudo-scientific jargon.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>AURA</ent>: The halo of either negative or positive energy supposedly
radiated by each living thing. The aura changes color depending upon
the state of the being and can be seen, felt and analyzed. It also
can be adjusted to replace negative energy with positive energy. The
science of reading auras, called "Radiathesia," is supposedly used to
do psychic readings and to diagnose physical ailments.</p>

<p> Bio Feedback A quasi-scientific technique using a form of the
electro-encephalogram machine to train people to control their brain
waves. Used for relaxation or stress management, but also used to
induce altered states of consciousness. Often called "The YOGA of the
West."</p>

<p> CHANGE AGENTS: (or "agents of change") This is a term found
commonly in <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> literature, especially referring to teachers,
social workers, counselors, etc. These people are viewed by the
movement as being primary agents for bringing about transformations in
the way our children think and respond. Thus, <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>-oriented
educators, etc., are viewed as "secret agents" operating with a hidden
agenda toward their pupils or clients. This agenda is essentially the
destruction of traditional morality and religion and its replacement
with <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> doctrine (see critical thinking)</p>

<p> CREATE YOUR OWN REALITY: A common catch-phrase in the movement. It
is the idea that reality is somehow "plastic" or malleable and
ultimately only exists in a spiritual form. Therefore, you can alter
your reality by mind-power.</p>

<p> Channeling: Channeling as defined by <ent type='PERSON'>David Spangler</ent>, one of the
world's leading <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> thinkers:"Channeling is a phenomenon in which
a physical person enters an altered state of consciousness and lends
his or her mind and /or body (depending on the technique employed) to
be used by a non-physical entity in order to communicate from its
level of existence to ours." A person who is totally yielded to a
spiritual entity that Channeling speaks through the person. Another
term for channeler is 'Medium'. Critical Thinking: A thinking
discipline that removes all prior learned judgement systems from
individual upbringings within the family environment. This includes
all values including morals, church teachings, or standards. The
group within the teaching environment then determines the standards,
morals, etc. for themselves. Another term for this is values
clarification. Values are clarified through group decisions with no
absolutes. <ent type='ORG'>Cooperative Learning</ent>: Group accountability and not the
individual being responsible for his or her own work. NOTE: God holds
individuals accountable for what they do and not a group.</p>

<p> CHRIST SPIRIT: (or Christ-self) This is the higher power part of
self that knows all and can be consulted for wisdom. This "christ" is
considered an energy but not a person. It was not unique to <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent>,
but "rested" on many great teachers, and can, to a greater or lesser
degree, rest within anyone. It can be reached through meditation
exercises and mantras. Also called the higher self, christ
consciousness, oversoul, mother soul, and guide.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>CRYSTALOMANCY</ent>: Originally, a method of divination by gazing into a
crystal ball or mirror. Visions of the future supposedly appear in
the crystal. In recent years, the use of crystals in the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> has
mushroomed. Crystals are now believed to be able to convey energy or
information; and carrying them is supposed to bring health, power or
good fortune, depending on the type of crystal.</p>

<p> A Global Society Moving oneself into a society that is one culture,
one religion, one leader, and becoming just another person, or number.
The blurring or destruction of all national or religious boundaries is
implied. Not so evident is the desire of the "globalist" to have a
one world political-economic-religious government under one "all-wise"
ruler.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Occult</ent> Healing Practices: Homeopathy, hypnosis (including
subliminals), pendulums, magnetic healing, polarity therapy,
iridology, acupuncture, the use of crystals or pyramids. All of these
practices (with the possible exception of acupuncture) have dubious
scientific bases, and claim to deal with spiritual energy fields in
the body. They are all rooted in pagan/occult world views. A good
rule is: If there is no scientifically measurable reason for the
therapy to work, or if it claims to work on "polarity" or "energy
balancing," you should stay away from it. Yoga and the Martial Arts:
Rooted in <ent type='NORP'>Hinduism</ent> or Taoism, both <ent type='NORP'>Oriental</ent>, pagan religions.
Involves opening the soul up to supernatural power called siddhis,
prana or chi, even at the intermediate levels. <ent type='ORG'>Tantric</ent> yoga, Raja
Yoga, and internal martial arts like Aikido, Hsing I and Pa Kua Kung
Fu or <ent type='PERSON'>Tai Chi Chuan</ent> are especially dangerous.</p>

<p> Meditation, stress reduction: Although there is <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent>
meditation, it involves reflecting on God's Word. What concerns us
are meditation and stress reduction that involve emptying your mind or
"centering." Such concepts are being taught as stress techniques, and
while they seem to work, they are also an open door for any sort of
demonic influence which wishes to come in. We are talking here about
guided imagery, visualization, and progressive relaxation techniques.
This is also true of OOBE (Out of the Body Experiences) or astral
projection. If you aren't "in" your body or mind, then who (or what)
is?</p>

<p> KARMA: A Sanskrit term (<ent type='NORP'>Hindu</ent>) which basically means cause and
effect. Anything you do, good or evil, will come back to you@in this
life or in your next life or "incarnation." Reincarnation is an
implicit assumption of karma. When you finally eliminate all bad
karma from hundreds of lives, you transcend the wheel of karma and
melt into <ent type='PERSON'>Buddha</ent>-hood, the <ent type='ORG'>Atman</ent>, or God-consciousness all
individuality is lost then. This is the goal of most <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>
disciples who believe in karma.</p>

<p> Kundalini Yoga is the serpent force which they believe is coiled at
the base of the spine. <ent type='NORP'>Western</ent>ers don't use the term 'serpent' but
rather use the term 'energy'. The goal is to force the serpent force
through the chakras, or the spines psychic channels, releasing the
kundalini force within us to receive psychic powers and become divine.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>MANTRA</ent>: A special word, often in the Sanskrit language, but not
necessarily. This word is chanted repeatedly to induce some sort of
change in consciousness. Quite often the mantras used in Yoga, names
of <ent type='NORP'>Hindu</ent> gods (demons), and the chanting of the mantra will invoke the
god and bring him into your body.</p>

<p> MASTERS, ASCENDED: Most <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> people believe that we are guided
by a highly evolved, perfected hierarchy of spiritual entities who are
invisible, but who educate us through dreams, psychic experiences, and
through channelers. <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> is said to be one Ascended Master, but
there are others, like <ent type='PERSON'>Maitreya</ent> or <ent type='PERSON'>Sanat Kumara</ent>, who are greater.
Their teachings are not to be questioned.</p>

<p> RAINBOW: Although the rainbow is a Biblical symbol of God's
covenant faihtfulness (Gen 9:13), its beauty and charm have made it a
popular symbol within the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>. This does not mean that everyone
who uses a rainbow is in the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>. However, the use of the rainbow
as symbol should be looked at. To the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> person, the rainbow is
symbolic of the Abtahkarana, or Rainbow Bridge over which the initiate
must travel to attain godhood. <ent type='PERSON'>Maitreya</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> Christ, is said
to be the primary transmitter of "rainbow energies," as well. Another
common <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> use of the rainbow is as a symbol of many different
religions and races blending together into one unified whole. This
uses the metaphor of the prism, where white light is refracted into
many colors. Thus, the rainbow here is used to symbolize how we all
have fragments of God-ness within us and are all one entity.</p>

<p> REINCARNATION: A cardinal doctrine of the <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>, this teaches
that no one ever really dies, but rather you go through hundreds of
lifetimes in which you gradually perfect yourself by eliminating bad
karma and attaining God-consciousness. Thus, if they don't get it all
together in this life, they will have others ahead. Raja Yoga, or
meditation of the mind, is to look into ones self to find the true
self and in finding true self is finding God. This uniting with God
is understood better by knowing that the guru's are considered Christ
or the Christ Spirit incarnate. But in <ent type='PERSON'>Matthew</ent> 24:23-24 <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> gives
us warning about false <ent type='NORP'>Christs</ent>. Realization Techniques-which is TM
(Transcendental Meditation): Through vibrations you open your mind
channels to spirit beings to find your godhead. (In chanting the
<ent type='NORP'>Mantras</ent>, you are often chanting to <ent type='NORP'>Hindu</ent> deities which are demons.)</p>

<p> SPIRITUAL ENTITY: A non-human spirit being. Usually these entities
speak through channelers (mediums) and claim to be masters or
Boddhisatvas (saints) who have completely escaped the wheel of karma
and are now perfected beings. They communicate with humans to help us
grow spiritually. According to the Bible, these are angels who
rebelled against God@or demons. Also known as a Spirit guide</p>

<p> TAROT: Divination or fortunetelling with a deck of cards specifical
designed to tell the future. <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent>rs believe that information on
the future comes from the higher consciousness.</p>

<p> UNIVERSAL MIND: This doctrine draws heavily from <ent type='NORP'>Hinduism</ent> and the
theories of the occult psychiatrist <ent type='PERSON'>Carl Jung</ent>. It teaches that we are
all part of a universal super-mind which permeates all things. This
mind has all the collective memories of the race and can, if properly
tapped, be the source of eternal wisdom. It is a similar, but not
identical concept to the Christ spirit; and it is very akin to the
"<ent type='ORG'>Force</ent>" of the Star Wars movies.</p>

<p> VALUES CLARIFICATION: An educational strategy common in school
curricula promoted by <ent type='ORG'>New Age</ent> theorists, this concept essentially
trains students to discard all values of family or church and instead
use moral values arrived at through consensus among classmates or
situation ethics. Usually these values are utterly at odds with what
has been taught the child at home. Pragmatism (end justifies the
means) and lack of moral absolutes are encouraged. See also critical
thinking.</p>

<p> VISUALIZATION:Making something real by imagining it into existence.
Also know as guided imagery, visualization assumes that consciousness
has the power to create reality</p>

<p> YOGA: The self realization of the God within you is the essence of
Yoga. You look within yourself to find your true self, and in finding
your true self you find God.</p>
