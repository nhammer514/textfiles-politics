<ent type='ORG'>FBI License Plate</ent> Codes</p>

<p> Somewhere in the vicinity of 2500 <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Eastern</ent> European
officials live in <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States at any given time. The U.S.
State Department estimates that 30% to 40% of them are spies.</p>

<p> This comes to about 900 working spies in the diplomatic corps.</p>

<p> It is a very difficult job to keep track of the comings and goings
of these "diplomats", so the government has developed coded
diplomatic license plates.</p>

<p> The code applies ONLY to diplomatic plates which are conspicuously
red, white and blue with the word DIPLOMAT printed at the top.</p>

<p> All diplomatic licenses have a D. The other two letters indicate
the nation. SX for example, indicates that the car carries diplomats
from the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> counter-intelligence agents are given wallet-sized cards listing
the codes for eighteen "problem" nations.</p>

<p> These nations are identified by the following codes :</p>

<p> <ent type='GPE'>Albania</ent> CP <ent type='GPE'>Libya</ent> FM
<ent type='GPE'>Bulgaria</ent> OM <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent> QU
<ent type='GPE'>China</ent> CY <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Korea GQ
<ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent> DC <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent> QW
Czechoslavakia PH Romania ND
East <ent type='GPE'>Germany</ent> TJ South Africa FY
Hungary KH <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union SX
<ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> DM <ent type='GPE'>Syria</ent> AQ
<ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> TS Vietnam LD</p>

<p> The <ent type='ORG'>Washington Post</ent> published the code against the wishes of the
State Department. They feared <ent type='ORG'>RAMBO</ent> types might attack diplomatic
vehicles of countries they did not like.
