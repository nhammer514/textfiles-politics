<ent type='PERSON'>Nikola</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> and The <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> Howitzer</p>


<p>Before the turn of the century, <ent type='PERSON'>Nikola</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> had discovered and
was utilizing a new type of electric wave. <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> repeatedly
stated his waves were non-<ent type='GPE'>Hertzian</ent>, and his wireless
transmissions did not fall off as the square of the distance.
His discovery was apparently so fundamental (and his intent to
provide free energy to all humankind was so clear) that it was
responsible for the withdrawal of his financial backing, his
deliberate isolation, and the gradual removal of his name from
the history books.</p>

<p>By 1914 or so, <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> had been successfully isolated and was
already nearly a "nonperson." Thereafter <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> lived in nearly
total seclusion, occasionally surfacing (at his annual birthday
party for members of the press) to announce the discovery of an
enormous new source of free energy, the perfection of wireless
transmission of energy without losses, fireball weapons to
destroy whole armies and thousands of airplanes at hundreds of
miles distance, and a weapon (the "<ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> Shield," I've dubbed
it) that could provide an impenetrable defense and thus render
war obsolete.</p>

<p>In my pursuit of Tesla's secret, it gradually became apparent to
me that present orthodox electromagnetic theory is seriously
flawed in some fundamental respects. One of these is in the
definition and use of <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>, the scalar electrostatic
potential. It is this error which has hidden the long-sought
Unified Field Theory from the theorists.</p>

<p>In the theory of the scalar electrostatic potential (<ent type='ORG'>SEP</ent>), the
idea is introduced of work accomplished on a charge brought in
from a distance against the scalar field. The <ent type='ORG'>SEP</ent> is not a
vector field, but is a scalar field. Indeed, scalar potential
cannot of itself perform work on a charged mass due to the
extremely high <ent type='ORG'>SEP</ent> of the vacuum itself. Only a differential of
<ent type='ORG'>SEP</ent> between two spatial points can produce force or accomplish
work. (Rigorously, a differential of scalar potential between
two spatial points constitutes a vector. Only a vector can
produce force and do work.)</p>

<p>Also, work can only be done on a mass. Further, it takes <ent type='ORG'>TIME</ent>
to move an electron or other charged mass between two spatial
points, and so the work performed by a spatial differential of
the <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>-FIELD requires <ent type='ORG'>TIME</ent>. Rigorously, the delta <ent type='ORG'>SEP</ent> is
voltage, not <ent type='ORG'>SEP</ent> per se, and is directly related to the voltage
or "E" field. The entire voltage concept depends on the work
performed in moving a mass, after that mass has moved. The idea
of "voltage" always implies the existence of a steady
differential of <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent> between two spatial points for a finite
length of time, and it also involves the assumption of a flow of
actual mass having occurred. <ent type='ORG'>SEP</ent>, on the one hand, is always a
single-point function; on the other hand, difference in
potential (i.e., V) is always a two point function, as is any
vector.</p>

<p>Yet many graduate level physics and electromagnetics papers and
texts erroneously confuse <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent> and V in the static case! Such
an interpretation is of course quite incorrect.</p>

<p>Another common assumption in present EM theory -- that the
electrostatic potential (0,O) of the normal vacuum is zero --has
no legitimate basis. In fact, we know (0,O) is nonzero because
the vacuum is filled with enormous amounts of fluctuating
virtual state activity, including incredible charge
fluctuations. And by virtue of its point definition, (0,O) must
be the "instantaneous stress" on spacetime itself, and a measure
of the intensity of the virtual state flux through a 4-dimensional spacetime point.</p>

<p>Potential theory was largely developed in the 1800's before the
theory of relativity. Time flowrate was then regarded as
immutable. Accordingly, electrostatic "intensity" was chosen as
"spatial intensity," with the connotation of "spatial flux
density." This assumes a constant, immutable rate of flow of
time, which need not be true at all if we believe relativity.
Such a spatial "point" intensity is actually a "line" in 4-space, and not a 4-dimensional "point" at all. Thus the
spatial potential -- 0, 3 -- is a very special case of the real
spacetime potential --04, or charge -- and electromagnetic
theory today is accordingly a special case of the real 4-space
electromagnetism that actually exists! Note also that charge is
a 4-dimensional concept.</p>

<p>Now mass is a spatial, 3-dimensional concept. Rigorously, mass
does not exist in time -- <ent type='GPE'>masstime</ent> exists in time. Mass and
charge are thus of differing dimensionalities!</p>

<p>Also, according to quantum mechanics, the charge of a particle --
e.g., of an electron -- is due to the continual flux of virtual
particles given off and absorbed by the observable particle of
mass. Thus charge also is conceptually a measure of the virtual
flux density, and directly related to <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>. Further, since the
charge exists in time, it is the charge of a particle of spatial
mass that gives it the property of <ent type='GPE'>masstime</ent>, or existing in
time.</p>

<p>Here a great confusion and fundamental error has been thrown
into the present EM theory by the equating of "charge" and
"charged mass." As we have seen, the two things are really very
different indeed.</p>

<p>To speak of a spatial "amount" of charge erroneously limits the
basic EM theory to a fixed time flowrate condition (which of
course it was considered to be, prior to Einstein's development
of relativity). Thus when the limited present theory encounters
a "relativistic" case (where the time flowrate changes), all
sorts of extraordinary corrections must be introduced. The real
problem, of course, is with the fundamental definitions of
electrostatic potential and charge. The spatial "amount" of
charge (i.e., the coulomb), as we presently erroneously use the
term, is actually the spatial amount of observable "charged
mass." To correct the theory, one must introduce the true 4-space <ent type='ORG'>SEP</ent> and separate the definitions of charge and charged
mass.</p>

<p>Only when a mass is moved does one have work -- and voltage or
vector fields. (The reason one has voltage and E field
connected to a normal electrostatically charged object in the
laboratory is because an excess of charged-particle masses are
assembled on the object, and these masses are in violent
motion! A true static charge would have no E field at all.)</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent> field need not involve observable mass accumulation,
but only charge (virtual flowrate intensity) accumulation.
Accumulated masses are like so many gallons of water;
accumulated charge is like so much pressure on both the water
(space) and the time in which the water is existing.</p>

<p> Now, if one varies the <ent type='ORG'>SEP</ent> solely as a point function, one would
have a purely scalar complex longitudinal wave, and not a vector
wave at all. This is the fundamentally new electrical wave that
<ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> discovered in 1899.</p>

<p>Rigorously, all vector fields are two-point functions and thus
decomposable into two scalar fields, as <ent type='PERSON'>Whittaker</ent> showed in
1903. It follows that any vector wave can be decomposed into
two scalar waves. By implication, therefore, a normal
transverse EM vector wave, e.g., must simply be two coupled
scalar (<ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent>) waves -- and these scalars independently would be
longitudinal if uncoupled. An ordinary transverse EM vector
wave is thus two pair-coupled <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> scalar longitudinal waves,
and only a single special case of the much more fundamental
electromagnetics discovered by <ent type='PERSON'>Nikola</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent>.</p>

<p> A <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> (scalar potential) wave -- i.e., a massless wave in pure
0,O, the stress of the spacetime medium -- would have very
strange characteristics indeed. For one thing, since it moves
in a complex 4-space, it has many more modes of movement than
does a simple wave in 3-space. And for another thing, it need
not be bound at all by the speed of (vector) light. In current
theory, one 03-field does not directly interact or couple with
other existing 03-fields except by simple superposition.
Therefore presently the <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>-field is considered to have no
drag limitation at all, hence infinite velocity. (E.g., as
stated in Jackson's, (Classical Electrodynamics, 2nd edition,
page 223.)</p>

<p>Actually, a 04-wave can and will interact with some of the
other existing 04-waves in the medium transversed, and this
interaction can involve pair-coupling into EM vector fields and
waves, an interaction not presently in the electrodynamics
theory. The result of scalar pair-coupling creates a finite
amount of vector "drag" on the 04-wave, so it then has less
than infinite velocity. However, is this drag is small due to
limited pair coupling, the scalar wave's velocity through the
slightly dragging medium still may be far greater than the speed
of vector EM waves (light) in vacuum. On the other hand, if the
pair-coupling is made severe, the <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>-wave may move at a speed
considerably below the speed of vector light waves in vacuum.
The velocity of the 04-wave is thus both variable and
controllable or adjustable (e.g., simply by varying its initial
amplitude which through a given medium changes the percentage of
pair-coupling and hence the degree of drag on the scalar wave.)
The <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> scalar wave thus can have either subluminal or
superluminal velocity, in contradiction to present theory.</p>

<p>Note that the scalar wave also violates one of Einstein's
fundamental postulates -- for the speed of our "new kind of
light" wave is not limited to c, and need not be the same to
every observer. Thus <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> scalar waves lead to a new "super-relativity" of which the present <ent type='PERSON'>Einstein</ent> relativity is only a
highly special case!</p>

<p>But let us now look for some subtle but real examples of scalar
waves and scalar pair-coupling in nature. As is well known, a
tectonic fault zone can provide anomalous lights, sounds, etc
from stresses, piezoelectrical activity, and telluric currents
in the earth and through the fault zone. In examining the fault
zone phenomena, I finally realized that a fault zone was
literally a scalar interferometer --i.e., if one can have scalar
<ent type='ORG'>PHI</ent>-waves, they can interfere either constructively or
destructively. Their interference, however, produces scalar
pair-coupling into vector EM waves. This coupling may be at a
distance from the interferometer itself, and thus the
interferometer can produce energy directly at a distance,
without vector transmission through the intervening space.
Coupling of <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent> waves with the paired scalars comprising
ordinary EM vector waves can also occur. If this triplex
coupling forms additional EM vector waves 180 degrees out of
phase, the ordinary EM wave is diminished or extinguished. If
the scalar triplex coupling occurs so as to create vector EM
waves, the amplitude of the ordinary vector wave is increased.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Scalar</ent> potential waves can thus augment or diminish, or create
or destroy, ordinary EM waves at a distance by pair-coupling
interference under appropriate conditions, and this is in
consonance with the implications of Whittaker's fundamental 1903
work.</p>

<p>An earthquake fault zone is such a scalar interferometer.
Stresses and charge pileups exist in the plates on each side
adjacent to the fault, with stress relief existing in the middle
in the fault fracture itself. Since the rock is locally
nonlinear, the mechanical stresses and electrical currents in it
are also locally nonlinear. This results in the generation of
multiple frequencies of <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>-4-waves from each side of the
fault interferometer, yielding two complex Fourier expansion
patterns of scalar potential waves. On occasion these two
Fourier-transformed scalar wave patterns couple at a distance to
produce stable ordinary electromagnetic fields in a 3-dimensional spatial pattern --e.g., a stress light such as the
<ent type='ORG'>Vestigia</ent> light covered in Part I of The Excalibur Briefing.
Driven by the erratic two scalar Fourier expansion patterns of
the scalar interferometer (whose input stresses normally slowly
change), an erratic, darting, hovering "<ent type='PERSON'>spooklight</ent>" of the
variety studied by <ent type='ORG'>Vestigia</ent> produced.</p>

<p>As the stresses change in each side of the interferometer, the
distant scalar coupling zone is affected. Thus the stresslight
moves and its form changes, but it may be relatively stable in
form for seconds or minutes. Since the stresses in the rock may
be intense, the stress light may involve an intense pair or
<ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>-patterns coupling into the sphere or ball of vector EM
energy. The atoms and molecules of the air in the region of the
coupled stresslight ball thus become highly excited, giving off
radiant energy as the excited states decay.</p>

<p>Since much of the piezoelectric material in the stressed rocks
is quartz, the features of quartz are of particular interest.
Each little quartz is itself highly stressed, and has stress
cracks. It is therefore a little scalar interferometer.
Further, quartz is transparent to infrared and ultraviolet; and
the random orientation of all the quartz scalar interferometers
may also form a <ent type='ORG'>Prigogine</ent> system far from thermodynamic
equilibrium. If so, this system can tap into highly energetic
microscopic electromagnetic fluctuations to produce large-scale,
ordered, relatively stable patterns of electromagnetic energy at
a distance.</p>

<p>In short, all of this lends support to the formation of
relatively stable but somewhat erratic patterns of
electromagnetic energy at a distance from the fault itself. In
the atmosphere, such scalar interferometers could form in clouds
or even in the air or between clouds and earth. If so, such
rare but occasional "weather" scalar interferometers could
account for the rare phenomenon of ball lightening. The intense
energy of the ball lightening, as compared to the lesser energy
of an earth stress light, could well be due to the enormous
electrical charges between clouds or between cloud and earth,
available to fuel the scalar interferometer. Very probably it
is this phenomenon which gave <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> the clue to scalar wave
interferometry.</p>

<p>Thus such phenomena as earth stress lights, ball lightening, and
the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> system of wireless transmission of energy at a
distance with negligible lasses and at speeds exceeding the
speed of light may be explained. They are complex, however, and
involve fundamental changes to present electromagnetic theory.
These changes include utilizing 4-space scalar electrostatic
potentials, scalar waves, pair coupling, ordinary 3-dimensional Fourier expansion, the <ent type='ORG'>Prigogine</ent> effect, and the properties of
piezoelectric materials in rocks.</p>

<p>Since the scalar potential also stresses time, it can change the
rate of flow of time itself. Thus it affects anything which
exists in time -- including the mind, both of the individual and
at various levels of unconsciousness. Therefore the same
functions that result in earth stress lights also affect mind
and thought, and are in turn affected by mind and thought. This
is the missing ingredient in Persinger's theory that UFO's are
correlated with, and a result of, fault zones and earth
stresses. While <ent type='PERSON'>Persinger</ent> seems to feel this is a "normal
physics" explanation, it indeed involves a paranormal
explanation.</p>

<p>The time-stressing ability of the true <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent> scalar wave also
explains the interaction of such earth stress lights with humans
and human intent, as noted by other researchers. (E.g., the
lights that repeatedly seemed to react to the observers, as
detailed by Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Harley Rutledge</ent> in his epoch-making Project
Identification, Prentice-Hall, 1981.)</p>

<p>These ideas in condensed form comprise the concepts required to
violate the speed of light and produce an ordinary
electromagnetic field at a distance, using scalar
interferometry, without losses -- as <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> had done in his
wireless transmission system which he had tested prior to 1900
and had perfected by the 1930's. <ent type='ORG'>Scalar</ent> interferometry can give
stable regions of EM or "light energy" at a distance without
losses, particularly as detailed in the beautiful <ent type='ORG'>Vestigia</ent>
experiments, and it is within our grasp to utilize the new
effects. Indeed, any stress crack in a material can result in
the scalar potential interferometer effect. <ent type='ORG'>Exophoton</ent> and
exoelectron emission -- poorly understood but already known in
fatiguing of materials -- must be at least partly due to the
scalar interferometer effect.</p>

<p>However, one additional caution should be advanced. Normal
movement of electrons allows so much "sideplay" movement of the
electrons -- and there is so much such sideplay electron motion
in the surrounding vicinity -- that pair coupling is almost
instantaneous for small waves. Thus orbital electrons in atoms
seem to absorb and emit vector EM photons. Actually they also
emit some percentage of scalar waves as well. Since a scalar
wave is comprised exclusively of disturbance in the virtual
state, it need not obey the conservation of energy law.
Further, a scalar wave of itself does not "push electrons" or
other charges; hence it is nearly indetectable by present
detectors. Ionization detectors such as a <ent type='PERSON'>Geiger</ent> counter tube,
e.g., are exceptions if the scalar wave encountered is fairly
strong. In that case sufficient triplex coupling with the
ionized gas occurs to produce additional ionization or charge,
breaching the tube's cutoff threshold and producing a cascade
discharge of electrons and voltage which is detected. But weak scalar waves are presently indetectable by ordinary
instruments. However, these small scalar waves are detectable
by sensitive interferometry techniques -- e.g., such as an
electron interferometer. Since the use of such instruments is
quite rare, then indeed we have been living immersed in a sea of
scalar waves without knowing it.</p>

<p>Finally, the percentage of scalar waves produced by changes in
charged mass pileups can be increased by utilizing charged mass
streaming. Essentially the charged masses must be moved
suddenly, as quickly as possible, at or near the complete
breakdown of the medium. For this reason, <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> utilized
sparkgaps in his early transmission systems, but also found that
he could induce ionized media to "breakdown" in such fashion by
a slow growth process. One of his early patented atmospheric
wireless transmission systems is based on this fact. However,
it was necessary to use a very high voltage, insuring extreme
stress on the medium and hence some spillover stress onto time
itself. In other words, <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>-3 is always an approximation; at
sufficiently high spatial stress, sufficient spillover <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>-4
exists to give <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> scalar waves. For this reason, <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> used
very high voltages and extremely sharp discharges to give
"streaming" of the charged masses and thus high percentages of
<ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>-4 waves. This suggests that the breakdown of dielectrics
is a much richer phenomenon than is presently allowed for in the
conventional theory.</p>

<p>To summarize, electrostatic potential -- <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent> field --is stress
on the spacetime medium at a four-dimensional point. I.e., it
is a sort of pressure on the medium, but pressure on all four
dimensions, not just on the three spatial dimensions. Thus in
the new standard theory, <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>-4 may have complex values. In
addition, a <ent type='ORG'>PHI</ent>-wave is to be interpreted as a scalar
longitudinal wave in complex spacetime -- directly in <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>-0,
the normal average 4-space stress itself. And charge and
charged mass must be recognized as two separate concepts. This
is the gist of what I finally recognized about <ent type='PERSON'>Nikola</ent> Tesla's
work and fundamental discovery.</p>

<p>This is exciting, for it means that <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> stress waves can
affect either space or time individually, or both space and time
simultaneously, or even oscillate back and forth between
primarily affecting time and primarily affecting space. Tesla's
waves were actually these <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>-field scalar waves. As such,
they were fundamentally different from ordinary electromagnetic
waves, and had entirely different characteristics, just as <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent>
often stated. E.g., a <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> wave can either move spatially, with
time flowing linearly; move temporally only (sitting at a point
and waxing and waning in magnitude -- but changing the rate of
flow of time itself in doing so, and affecting gravitational
field, fundamental constants of nature, etc.), or move in a
combination of the two modes. In the latter case, the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent>
wave moves in space with a very strange motion -- it oscillates
between (1) spatially standing still and flexing time, and (2) moving smoothly in space while time flows smoothly and evenly.
I.e., it stands at one point (or at one columnar region),
flexing for a moment; then slowly picks up spatial velocity
until it is moving smoothly through space; then slows down again
to a "standing column," etc. This is Tesla's fabulous "standing
columnar wave."</p>

<p>Another wild characteristic of the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> wave is that it can
affect the rate of flow of time itself; hence it can affect or
change every other field -- including the gravitational field --
that exists in time flow. It can also affect all universal
constants, the mass of an object, the inertia of a body, and the
mind and thoughts as well! All of these exist in the flow of
time, and they are affected if the time stream in which they
exist is affected. This was the awful secret that <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent>
partially discovered by 1900, and which he came more and more
to fully realize as he pursued it nature and its ramifications
into the 1920's and 1930's.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> also found he could set up standing <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>-field waves
through the earth. He in fact intended to do so, for he had
also discovered that all charges in the highly stressed earth
regions in which such a standing wave existed produced <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>-fields which would feed (kindle) energy into the standing <ent type='ORG'>THETA</ent>-field wave by pair coupling. I.e., normal vector field energy
would "assemble" onto the scalar matrix wave by means of pair-coupling. Thus by transmitting a scalar wave into the earth, he
could easily tap the fiery scalar fields produced in the molten
core of the planet itself, turning them into ordinary
electromagnetic energy. In such case, a single generator would
enable anyone to put up a simple antenna and extract all the
free energy they desired.</p>

<p>When Tesla's alarmed financial backers discovered this was his
real intent, they considered him a dangerous madman and found it
necessary to ruthlessly stop his at all costs. And so his
financial support was withdrawn, he was harassed in his more
subtle patent efforts (and the patents themselves were
adulterated), and his name gradually was removed from all the
electrical textbooks. By 1914 <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent>, who had been the greatest
inventor and scientist in the world, had become essentially a
nonperson.</p>

<p>A few other persons in the early 1900's also were aware that
potential and voltage are different. And some of them even
learned to utilize Tesla's <ent type='ORG'>PHI</ent>-field, even though they only
vaguely understood they were utilizing a fundamentally different
kind of electromagnetic wave. For example, <ent type='PERSON'>James <ent type='PERSON'>Harris</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Rogers</ent></ent>
patented an undersea and underground communications system which
<ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> later confirmed utilized <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> waves. The U.S. secretly
used the <ent type='ORG'>Rogers</ent> communications system in <ent type='EVENT'>World War</ent> I to
communicate with U. S. submarines underwater, and to communicate
through the earth to <ent type='ORG'>the American</ent> Expeditionary Force
Headquarters in Europe. The <ent type='ORG'>Rogers</ent> system was declassified after the <ent type='ORG'>War</ent> --and very shortly after that, it had mysteriously
been scrubbed off the face of the earth. Again, potential
stress waves -- <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> waves -- were eliminated and "buried."</p>

<p> Probably the most brilliant inventor and researcher into Tesla's
electromagnetics was T. <ent type='PERSON'>Henry Moray</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Salt Lake City</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Utah</ent>.
Dr. Moray actually succeeded in tapping the limitless zero-point
energy of vacuum (spacetime) itself. By 1939, Dr. Moray's
amplifier contained 29 stages and its output stage produced 50
kilowatts of power from vacuum. Interestingly, another 50
kilowatts could be tapped off any other stage in the device --
which consequently could have produced almost 1.5 megawatts of
electrical power! Dr. Moray's epoch-making work was suppressed
also. His device -- which represented over 20 years of
heartbreaking accumulation of 29 working tubes from thousands
made -- was destroyed by a <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> agent in 1939, but not before
the agent had obtained the drawing for building the tubes and
the device itself. Today the Moray amplifier is a standard
component of many of the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> secret superweapons and <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent>
weapons.</p>

<p>In the 20's and 30's, <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> announced the final perfection of
his wireless transmission of energy without losses -- even to
interplanetary distances. In several articles (e.g., H.
Winfield Secor, "<ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> Maps Our Electrical Future," Science and
Invention, Vol. XVII, No. 12, pp. 1077, 1124-1126), <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> even
revealed he used longitudinal stress waves in his wireless power
transmission. Quoting from the article, "<ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> upholds the
startling theory formulated by him long ago, that the radio
transmitters as now used, do not emit <ent type='ORG'>Hertz</ent> waves, as commonly
believed, but waves of sound." "He says that a <ent type='ORG'>Hertz</ent> wave would
only be possible in a solid either, but he has demonstrated
already in 1897 that the either is a gas, which can only
transmit waves of sound; that is such as are propagated by
alternate compressions and rarefactions of the medium in which
transverse waves are absolutely impossible." The wily <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> did
not reveal, of course, that such scalar waves nearly always
immediately pair-coupled into vector waves when produced by
normal means. <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> himself was working with longitudinal
scalar waves.</p>

<p>In the 1930's <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> announced other bizarre and terrible
weapons: a death ray, a weapon to destroy hundreds or even
thousands of aircraft at hundreds of miles range, and his
ultimate weapon to end all war -- the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> shield, which
nothing could penetrate. However, by this time no one any
longer paid any real attention to the forgotten great genius.
<ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> died in 1943 without ever revealing the secret of these
great weapons.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, today in 1981 the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union has long since
discovered and weaponized the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> scalar wave effects. Here
we only have time to detail the most powerful of these
frightening <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> weapons -- which <ent type='ORG'>Brezhnev</ent> undoubtedly was referring to in 1975 when the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> side at the <ent type='ORG'>SALT</ent> talks
suddenly suggested limiting the development of new weapons "more
frightening than the mind of man had imagined." One of these
weapons is the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> howitzer recently completed at the
<ent type='ORG'>Saryshagan</ent> missile range and presently considered to be either a
high energy laser or a particle beam weapon. (See Aviation Week
&amp; Space Technology, July 28, 1980, p. 48 for an artist's
conception.)</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>Saryshagan</ent> howitzer actually is a huge <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> scalar
interferometer with four modes of operation. One continuous
mode is the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> shield, which places a thin, impenetrable
hemispherical shell of energy over a large defended area. The 3-dimensional shell is created by intefereing two Fourier-expansion, 3-dimensional scalar hemispherical patterns in space
so they pair-couple into a dome-like shell of intense, ordinary
electromagnetic energy. The air molecules and atoms in the
shell are totally ionized and thus highly excited, giving off
intense, glowing light. Anything physical which hits the shell
receives an enormous discharge of electrical energy and is
instantly vaporized -- it goes <ent type='GPE'>pfft</ent>! like a bug hitting one of
the electrical bug killers now so much in vogue.</p>

<p>If several of these hemispherical shells are concentrically
stacked, even the gamma radiation and EMP from a high altitude
nuclear explosion above the stack cannot penetrate all the
shells due to repetitive absorption and re-radiation, and
scattering in the layered plasmas.</p>

<p> In the continuous shield mode, the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> interferometer is fed
by a bank of Moray free energy generators, so that enormous
energy is available in the shield. A diagram of the <ent type='ORG'>Saryshagan</ent>-type <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> howitzer can be seen in drawing TESLA-1. TESLA-2
shows the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> shield produced by the howitzer.</p>

<p> In the pulse mode, a single intense 3-dimensional scalar <ent type='ORG'>Theta</ent>-field pulse form is fired, using two truncated Fourier
transforms, each involving several frequencies, to provide the
proper 3-dimensional shape (TESLA-3). This is why two scalar
antennas separated by a baseline are required. After a time
delay calculated for the particular target, a second and faster
pulse form of the same shape is fired from the interferometer
antennas. The second pulse overtakes the first, catching it
over the target zone and pair-coupling with it to instantly form
a violent EMP of ordinary vector (<ent type='GPE'>Hertzian</ent>) electromagnetic
energy. There is thus no vector transmission loss between the
howitzer and the burst. Further, the coupling time is extremely
short, and the energy will appear sharply in an "electromagnetic
pulse (EMP)" striking similar to the 2-pulsed EMP of a nuclear
weapon. This type is what actually caused the mysterious
flashes off the southwest coast of <ent type='LOC'>Africa</ent>, picked up in 1979 and
1980 by <ent type='PERSON'>Vela</ent> satellites. The second flash, e.g., was in the
infrared only, with no visible spectrum. Nuclear flashes do not
do that, and neither does super-lightening, meteorite strikes, meteors, etc. In addition, one of the scientists at the Arecibo
Ionospheric Observatory observed a gravitational wave
disturbance -- signature of the truncated Fourier pattern and
the time-squeezing effect of the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> potential wave --
traveling toward the vicinity of the explosion.</p>

<p> The pulse mode may be fed from either Moray generators or -- if
the Moray generators have suffered their anomalous "all fail"
malfunction -- ordinary explosive generators. Thus the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent>
howitzer can always function in the pulse mode, but it will be
limited in power if the Moray generators fail.</p>

<p> In the continuous mode, two continuous scalar waves are emitted -
- one faster than the other -- and they pair-couple into vector
energy at the region where they approach an in-phase condition.
In this mode, the energy in the distant "ball" or geometric
region would appear continuously and be sustained -- and this is
Tesla's secret of wireless transmission of energy at a distance
without losses. It is also the secret of a "continuous
fireball" weapon capable of destroying hundreds of aircraft or
missiles at a distance.</p>

<p>The volume of the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> fireball can be vastly expanded to yield
a globe which will not vaporize physical vehicles but will
deliver and EMP to them to dud their electronics. A test of
this mode has already been witnessed, See Gwyne Roberts,
"Witness to a Super Weapon?, <ent type='ORG'>the London</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Sunday</ent> Times, 17 August
1980 for several tests of this mode at <ent type='ORG'>Saryshagan</ent>, seen from
<ent type='GPE'>Afghanistan</ent> by <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> TV cameraman and former <ent type='ORG'>War</ent> Correspondent
<ent type='PERSON'>Nick Downie</ent>.</p>

<p>If the Moray generators fail anomalously, then a continuous mode
limited in power and range could conceivably be sustained by
powering the interferometer from more conventional power sources
such as advanced magneto-hydrodynamic generators.</p>

<p>Typical strategic <ent type='ORG'>ABM</ent> uses of <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> weapons are shown in <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent>-4. In addition, of course, smaller <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> howitzer systems for
anti-tactical ballistic missile defense of tactical troops and
installations could be constituted of more conventional field
missile systems using paired or triplet radars, of conventional
external appearance, in a scalar interferometer mode.</p>

<p>With Moray generators as power sources and multiply deployed
reentry vehicles with scalar antennas and transmitters, ICBM
reentry systems now can become long range "blasters" of the
target areas, from thousands of kilometers distance (TESLA-5).
Literally, "Star <ent type='ORG'>War</ent>s" is liberated by the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> technology.
And in air attack, jammers and <ent type='ORG'>ECM</ent> aircraft now become "<ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent>
blasters." With the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> technology, emitters become primary
fighting components of stunning power.</p>

<p>The potential peaceful implications of <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> waves are also
enormous. By utilizing the "time squeeze" effect, one can get
antigravity, materialization and dematerialization,
transmutation, and mind boggling medical benefits. One can also
get subluminal and superluminal communication, see through the
earth and through the ocean, etc. The new view of <ent type='ORG'>Theta</ent>-field
also provides a unified field theory, higher orders of reality,
and a new super-relativity, but detailing these possibilities
must wait for another book.</p>

<p>With two cerebral brain halves, the human being also has a <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent>
scalar interferometer between his ears. And since the brain and
nervous system processes avalanche discharges, it can produce
(and detect) scalar <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> waves to at least a limited degree.
Thus a human can sometimes produce anomalous spatio-temporal
effects at a distance and through time. This provides an exact
mechanism for psychokinesis, levitation, psychic healing,
telepathy, precognition, postcognition, remote viewing, etc. It
also provides a reason why an individual can detect a "stick" on
a radionics or <ent type='NORP'>Hieronymus</ent> machine (which processes scalar
waves), when ordinary detectors detect nothing. Unfortunately
there is not room to develop the implications of this human
<ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> interferometry in detail, for that must wait for yet
another book, presently in its initial stages, that <ent type='PERSON'>Hal Crawford</ent>
and I are writing.</p>

<p> At the July 1981 U.S. Psychotronics Association's Annual
Conference in <ent type='GPE'>Dayton</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Ohio</ent>, I presented the first rough paper on
the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> secret and scalar interferometry. A videotape of the
presentation was made and will shortly be available. I am also
scheduled to make a special presentation at the Alternate Energy
Conference in <ent type='GPE'>Toronto</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Canada</ent> in latter October, 1981. A
professional, videotaped two-hour presentation on this subject
is also being prepared. Wide distribution of the material
through the international underground physics and technology
network has already been made. This time, God willing, Tesla's
secret will not be suppresses for another 80 years!</p>

<p>And perhaps it is not yet too late. The material has cost me
(now) some 16 years of agonizing labor and nearly $100000 of my
own personal funds. No orthodox university, scientific group,
foundation, or governmental agency would support such an effort,
either financially or otherwise. Indeed, most ordinary journals
will not even accept material on such matters. Nonetheless, the
area is of overwhelming importance -- and I truly believe
Tesla's lost secret will shortly affect the lives of every human
being on earth.</p>

<p>Perhaps with the free and open release of Tesla's secret, the
scientific and governmental bureaucracies will be shocked awake
from their slumber, and we can develop defense before <ent type='ORG'>Armageddon</ent>
occurs. Perhaps there is hope after all -- for even <ent type='ORG'>Brezhnev</ent>,
in his strange July, 1975 proposal to the <ent type='ORG'>SALT</ent> talks, seemed to
reveal a perception that a turning point in wear and weaponry may have been reached, and that human imagination is incapable
of dealing with the ability to totally engineer reality itself.
Having tested the weapons, the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>s must be aware that the
ill-provoked oscillation of time flow affects the minds and
thoughts -- and the very life streams and even the collective
species unconsciousness -- of all life forms on earth. They
must know that these weapons are two-edged swords, and that the
backlash from their use can be far more terrible to the user
than was the original effect to his victim.</p>

<p>If we can avoid the Apocalypse, the fantastic secret of <ent type='PERSON'>Nikola</ent>
<ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> can be employed to cure and elevate man, not kill him.
Tesla's discovery can eventually remove every conceivable
external human limitation. If we humans ourselves can elevate
our consciousness to properly utilize the <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent>
electromagnetics, then <ent type='PERSON'>Nikola</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> -- who gave us the
electrical twentieth century in the first place -- may yet give
us a fantastic new future more shining and glorious than all the
great scientists and sages have imagined.</p>

<p> NIKOLA TESLA'S NEW WIRELESS

Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Nikola</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> has announced that as the result of experiments
conducted at <ent type='LOC'>Shoreham</ent>, <ent type='LOC'>Long Island</ent>, he has perfected a new
system of wireless telegraphy and telephony in which the
principles of transmission are the direct opposite of <ent type='GPE'>Hertzian</ent>
wave transmission. In the latter, he says, the transmission is
effected by rays akin to light, which pass through the air and
cannot be transmitted through the ground, while in the former
the <ent type='ORG'>Hertz</ent> waves are practically suppressed and the entire energy
of the current is transmitted through the ground exactly as
though a big wire. Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> adds that in his experiments in
<ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent> it was shown that a very powerful current developed by
the transmitter traversed the entire globe and returned to its
origin in an interval of 84 one-thousandths of a second, this
journey of 24000 miles being effected almost without loss of
energy.

TESLA'S NEW DEVICE LIKE BOLTS OF THOR

He Seeks to Patent Wireless Engine for Destroying Navies by
Pulling a Lever.

To Shatter Armies Also.

"Impractical," He says of Westerner's Plan to <ent type='ORG'>Circle Country</ent>
with <ent type='ORG'>Electric Fire</ent>.

<ent type='PERSON'>Nikola</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent>, the inventor, winner of the 1915 Nobel Physics
Prize, has filed patent applications on the essential parts of a
machine the possibilities of which test a layman's imagination
and promise a parallel of Thor's shouting thunderbolts from the
sky to punish those who angered the gods. Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> insists
there is nothing sensational about it, that it is but the
fruition of many years of work and study. He is not yet ready
to give the details of the engine which he says will render
fruitless any military expedition against a country which
possesses it. <ent type='ORG'>Suffice</ent> to say that the destructive invention
will go through space with a speed of 300 miles a second, and
manless airship without propelling engine or wings, sent by
electricity to any desired point on the globe on its errand of
destruction, if destruction its manipulator wishes to effect.

Ten miles or a thousand miles, it will be all the same to the
machine, the inventor says. Straight to the point, on land or
on sea, it will be able to go with precision, delivering a blow
that will paralyze of kill, as is desired. A man in a tower on
<ent type='LOC'>Long Island</ent> could shield <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> against ships or army by
working a lever, if the inventor's anticipations become
realizations.

"It is not the time," said Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> yesterday, "to go into the
details of this thing. It is founded on a principle that means
great things in peace, it can be used for great things in war.
But I repeat, this is no time to talk of such things.

"It is perfectly practicable to transmit electrical energy
without wires and produce destructive effects at a distance. I
have already constructed a wireless transmitter which makes this
possible, and have described it in my technical publications,
among which I may refer to my patent 1119732 recently
granted. With transmitters of this kind we are enabled to
project electrical energy in any amount to any distance and
apply it for innumerable purposes, both in peace and war.
Through the universal adoption of this system, ideal conditions
for the maintenance of law and order will be realized, for then
the energy necessary to the enforcement of right and justice
will be normally productive, yet potential, and in any moment
available, for attack and defense. The power transmitted need
not be necessarily destructive, for, if existence is made to
depend upon it, its withdrawal or supply will bring about the
same results as those now accomplished by force of arms.

Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> then said that it would be possible with his wireless
mechanism to direct an ordinary aeroplane, manless, to any point
over a ship or an army, and to discharge explosives of great
strength from the base of operations.

Asked to express an opinion upon the announcement last <ent type='LOC'>Sunday</ent> of
Charles H. <ent type='PERSON'>Harris</ent>, and electrical engineer of <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent>, that
he would be able to surround this country with an electrical
wall of fire in time of war, Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> gave it as his opinion
that Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Harris</ent> was not practical.

"It is hard to stamp as impossible such results as those
described in the press dispatches to which you refer. Granted,
however, that the project is feasible, it would take more than
all the motive power obtainable in <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States to throw a
wall of fire around the country. In fact, even the passage of
small currents at considerable distances through air consumes a
great deal of energy on account of the immense pressure
required. So, for instance, in lightening discharges, energy
may be delivered at the rated of billions of horsepower, though
the currents are of smaller volume than those developed by
electrical generators in our power houses."</p>
