<p>I have only compiled this list. I claim no responsibility for errors,

<p>THE PREMISE:</p>

<p>Last year, I attended a Science Fiction convention during which I
discovered (along with other things) that the makers of the
recently-demised TV series War of the Worlds, had a scene in the very first
episode, where the original <ent type='NORP'>Martian</ent> war machines were found mouldering in a
LA warehouse. For fun, the special effects folk labeled one of the boxes
in the warehouse 'Ark of the Covenant', indicating that it was the SAME
warehouse where the <ent type='ORG'>Govt</ent>. hid everything that folks were not to know
about. Recently, I decided to try to use this warehouse in a role-playing
game, for fun. I've been trying to figure out things that should be in
some of the boxes. I'm essentially looking for all sorts of things that
were shown on TV and in the movies, that were indicated fell into
government hands and were never heard from again. I'm also including
things that some folks claim have existed for years (like the 100 MPG
carburetor) that the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> has decided to hide away somewhere. (This
is where you conspiracy folks come in).</p>
