<p> Amendment No.
Offered by M.</p>

<p>1. <ent type='ORG'>SEC</ent>. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES
2. (a) The <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> finds:
3. (1) that telecommunications systems and networks are often
4 used in the furtherance of criminal activities including
5 organized crime, racketeering, extortion, kidnapping, espionage,
6 terrorism, and trafficking in illegal drugs; and
7 (2 ) that recent and continuing advances in
8 telecommunications technology, and the introduction of new
9 technologies and transmission modes by the telecommunications
10 industry, have made it increasingly difficult for government
11 agencies to implement lawful orders or authorizations to
12 intercept communications and thus threaten the ability of such
13 agencies effectively to enfore the laws and protect the national
14 security; and
15 (3) without the assistance and cooperation of providers of
16 electronic communication services and private branch exchange
17 operators, the introduction of new technologies and transmission
18 modes into telecommunications systems witout consideration and
19 accomodation of the need of government agencies lawfully to
20 intercept communications, would impede the ability of such
21 agencies effectively to carry out their responsibilities.
22</p>

<p>1 The purpose of this Act are:
2 (1) to clarify the duty of providers of electronic
3 communication services and private branch exchange operators to
4 provide such assistance as necessary to ensure the ability of
5 government agencies to implement lawful orders or authorizations
6 to intercept communications; and
7 (2) to ensure that <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Communications Commission</ent>,
8 in the setting of standards affecting providers of electronic
9 communication services or private branch exchange operators, will
10 accomodate the need of government agencies lawfully to intercept
11 communications.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>DIGITAL TELEPHONY AMENDMENT</ent>
(report language)</p>

<p>Significant changes are being made in the systems by which
communications services are provided. <ent type='ORG'>Digital</ent> technologies,
fiber optics, and other telecommunications transmission
technologies are coming into widespread use. These changes
in communications systems and technologies make it increasingly
difficult for government agencies to implement lawful orders or
authorizations to intercept communications in order to enfore
the laws and protect the national security.</p>

<p>With the assistance of providers of electronic communication
services, these technological advances need not impede
the ability of government agencies to carry out their
responsibilities. This bill would direct the Federal
Communications <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>FCC</ent>) to issue standards ensuring
that communications systems and service providers continue
to accomodate lawful government communications intercepts.
The regulations are not intended to cover federal government
communications systems. Procedure already exist by which
<ent type='ORG'>the Federal Bureau</ent> of Investigation <ent type='PERSON'>amy</ent> obtain federal agency
cooperation in implementing lawful orders or authorizations
applicable to such systems. Further, there would be no
obligation on the part of the service providers or any other party
to ensure access to the plain text of encrypted or other encoded
material, but rather only to the communication in whatever form
it is transmitted. It is thus the intent and purpose of the
bill only to maintain the government's current communications
interception capability where properly ordered or authorized.
No expansion of that authority is sought.</p>

<p> ANALYSIS</p>

<p>
Subsection 2(a) and (b) would require the Federal Communications
<ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>FCC</ent>) to issue any regulations deemed necessary to
ensure that telecommunications equipment and technology used
by providers of electronic communications services or private branch
exchange operators will permit the government to intercept
communications when such interception is lawfully authorized.
The regulations would also require that equipment or technologies
currently used by such providers or operators that impede this
ability until brought into compliance with the regulations.
Compliance with <ent type='ORG'>FCC</ent> regulations issued under this section would
be required within 180 days of their issuance.</p>

<p>Subsection 2(c) provides that the Commission's authority to
implement and enforce the provisions of this section are the same
as those it has with respect to common carriers subject to its
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Subsection 2(d) would give the Attorney General the authority to
request injunctive relief against non-complying service providers
or private branch exchange operators.</p>

<p>Subsection 2(e) provides civil penalty authority for willful
violations of the regulations of up to $10000 per day for each
violation.</p>

<p>Subsection 2(f) would permit the <ent type='ORG'>FCC</ent> to provide rate relief to
service providers subject to its rate-setting jurisdiciton for
the costs associated with modifying equipment or technologies to
carry out the purposes of the bill.</p>

<p>Subsections 2(g), (h), and (i) require the Attorney General
to advise the <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent> regarding the specific needs and
performance criteria required to maintain government intercept
capabilities, require the <ent type='ORG'>FCC</ent> to ensure that the standards and
specifications it promulgates may be implemented on a royalty-free basis, and authorize the Attorney General to require that
particular <ent type='ORG'>Commission</ent> rulemaking proceedings to implement the Act
be closed to the public.</p>

<p>Subsection 2(j) provides definitions for key terms used in this
section.
