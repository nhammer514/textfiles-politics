Those U.S. Government Officials Whose Golden
Triangle Heroin Trafficking Has Prevented the
<ent type='ORG'>Ret</ent>urn of Our POWs From Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent></p>

<p>I am going to assume that you are acquainted with the seriousness of the
matter presented herein. On a WHITE <ent type='ORG'>HOUSE</ent> sanctioned mission to <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> for the
rescue of <ent type='ORG'>American Missing</ent> In Action I learned of a major heroin smuggling
opperation involving past and present U.S. government officials which has
obstructed the <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urn of known <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> <ent type='ORG'>MIA</ent>s from <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent>, Cambodia and <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>.
I reported this to the WHITE <ent type='ORG'>HOUSE</ent> and all appropriate congressional
committees. I am now taking to the public the information these government
officials refuse to act upon.</p>

<p>(The Overview File is not ready at this time. My letter to <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent> and
Khun Sa's letter to the Justice Department may serve to introduce this subject
until Overview is finished.)</p>

<p>February 1988
<ent type='GPE'>S<ent type='PERSON'>andy</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Valley</ent></ent>, NV</p>

<p>Honorable <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent>
Vice President
United States of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C.</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>AWhy does it seem that you are saying "YES" to illegal narcotics in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>?</p>

<p>I turned over video tapes to your <ent type='ORG'>NSC</ent> staff assistant, <ent type='PERSON'>Tom Harvey</ent>, January
1987, wherein <ent type='ORG'>General KHUN</ent> SA, overlord of Asia's "<ent type='ORG'>Golden Triangle</ent>", offered
to stop 900 tons of heroin/opium from entering the free world in 1987. <ent type='PERSON'>Harvey</ent>
told me, "...there is no interest here in doing that." General Khun Sa also
offered to identify U.S. Government officials who, he says, have been
trafficking in heroin for more than 20 years.</p>

<p>November 1986, <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent></ent> and I went into <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> in coordination and
cooperation with The <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Tom Harvey</ent> told me you received a letter
from <ent type='PERSON'>Arthur Suchesk</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Orange County</ent>, CA, dated 29 August 1986. Dr. Suchesk
said that Gen Khun Sa had access to U.S. POWs. <ent type='PERSON'>Harvey</ent> said the letter had
received "highest attention". He gave me a copy along with other case
documents. I was asked if it was possible to verify the information.
According to <ent type='PERSON'>Harvey</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> said Khun Sa had been assassinated some months
before. <ent type='PERSON'>Harvey</ent> supplied <ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> and myself with language under <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> and
<ent type='ORG'>NSC</ent> letterhead that would help us gain access to Khun Sa. It worked.
Unfortunately, Khun Sa knew nothing about US POWs. He did, however, offer to
trade his nation's poppy dependence for a legitimate economy.</p>

<p>Instead of receiving an "<ent type='PERSON'>Atta Boy</ent>" for bringing back video tape showing Khun
Sa's offer to stop 900 tons of illegal narcotics and expose dirty <ent type='ORG'>USG</ent>
officials, <ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> was jailed and I was threatened. I was told that if I didn't
"erase and forget" all that we had discovered, I would, ~hurt the government".
Further, I was promised a prison sentence of "15 years".</p>

<p>I <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urned to <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> with two other <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> witnesses, <ent type='PERSON'>Lance Trimmer</ent>, a
private detective from <ent type='GPE'>San Francisco</ent>, and <ent type='PERSON'>Barry Flynn</ent> from <ent type='GPE'>Boston</ent>. Gen Khun
Sa identified some of those in government service he says were dealing in
heroin and arms sales. We video taped this second interview and I turned
copies over in June 1987, to the Chairman of <ent type='ORG'>the Select Committee</ent> on
Intelligence; Chairman of <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> on Foreign Affairs Task Force on Narcotics
Control; Co)Chairman, Senate Narcotics <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>; Senator <ent type='PERSON'>Harry Reid</ent>, NV;
Representative <ent type='PERSON'>James Bilbray</ent>, NV; and other <ent type='NORP'>Congressional</ent> members. Mister
<ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent>, Assistant Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ary of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> for International Security
Affairs, is one of those <ent type='ORG'>USG</ent> officials implicated by Khun Sa. Nothing was
done with this evidence that indicated that anyone of authority, including
yourself, had intended to do anything more than protect Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent>. I was
charged with "Mis)use of Passport". Seems that it is alright for <ent type='PERSON'>Oliver north</ent>
and Robert MacFarlane to go into <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> on <ent type='NORP'>Irish</ent> Passports to negotiate an
illegal arms deal that neither you nor anyone else admits condoning, but I
can't use a passport that brings back drug information against your friends.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Lance Trimmer</ent> and I submitted a "<ent type='ORG'>Citizen Complaint</ent> of Wrongdoing by <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent>
Officers" to Attorney General <ent type='PERSON'>Edwin Meese</ent>, III on 17 September 1987.
Continuous private and Legislative inquiries to date indicate that the
Attorney General's Office has "lost" the document. <ent type='NORP'>Congressional</ent> requests to
<ent type='ORG'>the Government Accounting Office</ent> have resulted in additional government snares
and stalls.</p>

<p>January 20, 1988, I talked before your <ent type='ORG'>Breakfast Club</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Houston</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>. A
distinguished group of approximately 125 associates of yours, including the
Chief Justice of the <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> Supreme <ent type='ORG'>Court</ent>, expressed assurance that you are a
righteous man. Almost all of them raised their hand when I asked how many of
them know you personally. If you are a man with good intent, I pray you will
do more than respond to this letter. I ask that you seriously look into the
possibility that political appointees close to you are guilty of by)passing
our Constitutional process, and for purposes of promoting illegal covert
operations, conspired in the trafficking of narcotics and arms.</p>

<p>Please answer why a respected <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Citizen like mister H. <ent type='PERSON'>Ross Perot</ent> can
bring you a pile of evidence of wrongdoing by <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> and others, and you,
according to <ent type='ORG'>TIME</ent> magazine (May 4, page 18), not only offer him no support,
but have your Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ary of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Frank Carlucci</ent> tell Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Perot</ent> to "stop
pursuing Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent>". Why Sir, will you not look into affidavits gathered
by <ent type='ORG'>The Christic Institute</ent> (<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C.), which testify that <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> not
only trafficked in heroin, but did so under the guise of an officer charged
with bringing home our POWs. If the charges are true, <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent>, who is still
responsible for POW recovery as your Assistant Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ary of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> <ent type='ORG'>ISA</ent>, has
every reason not to want these heros <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urned to us alive. Clearly, follow)on
investigations would illuminate the collective crimes of <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> and others.</p>

<p>Several years ago a sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ary working for <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> asked me "Why would he have
us expunge his official record of all reference to past POW/<ent type='ORG'>MIA</ent> assignments
and activities?" Not knowing, I ventured a guess that maybe he was considering
running for public office and didn't feel the POW ) <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> association would
be a plus in his resume. It was about the same time a <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agent named by Khun
Sa turned up dead in <ent type='GPE'>Bangkok</ent> under "mysterious circumstances". Also about
this time, as an agent of NSC's Intelligence Support Activity, I was told by
<ent type='ORG'>ISA</ent> Chief <ent type='PERSON'>Jerry King</ent>, "...there are still too many bureaucrats in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>
who don't want to see POWs <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urned alive". I failed to realize the fullness
of his meaning, or these other events, until in May 1987, Gen Khun Sa, in his
jungle headquarters, named <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent> as a key connection in a ring of
heroin trafficking mobsters and <ent type='ORG'>USG</ent> officials. A U.S. agent I have known for
many years stopped by my home last month enroute to his next overseas
assignment. He remarked that he had worked for those <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> chiefs named by Khun
Sa, and that by his own personal knowledge, he knew what Khun Sa said was
true. He was surprised it had taken so long to surface.</p>

<p>I am a registered <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>. I voted for you twice. I will not do so again.
If you have any love or loyalty in your heart for this nation; if you have not
completely sold out, then do something positive to determine the truth of
these most serious allegations. You were Director of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> in 1975, during
a time Khun Sa says <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> officials were trafficking in heroin. As
Director of Intelligence you were responsible to the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> people for the
activities of your assistant ) even as you should know what some of these same
people are doing who are close to you now as our Vice President because i feel
these "parallel government" types will only be promoted by you, giving them
more reason to bury our POWs.</p>

<p>I am enclosing some documentation that supports the charges made. Chief is a
letter from Khun Sa to the U.S. Justice Department dated 28 June 1987, wherein
<ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent> is named along with <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent> (your former Deputy
Director <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> fro Covert Operations) and others. Please also note <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent>
Stevenson's article, "Bank of Intrigue ) Circles of Power". You, <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent>,
and General <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Secord</ent> are prominently mentioned. <ent type='PERSON'>Stevenson</ent>, you might
remember, authored A MAN CALLED INTREPID. Also <ent type='PERSON'>Tom Fitzpatrick</ent>'s article,
"From <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> to <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>, a Heroin Highway", should interest you. Both of these
men are prize winning journalists. The book, CRIMES of <ent type='ORG'>PATRIOTS</ent>, "A True Tale
of Dope, Dirty Money, and the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>", by <ent type='PERSON'>Jonathan Kwitny</ent>, reporter for the Wall
Street Journal, details for you the bank connections that Khun Sa mentions.
Finally, the basic primer that spells out exactly how this dope for covert
operations gambit began, is Alfred McCoy's THE POLITICS OF HEROIN IN SOUTHEAST
ASIA. All of these should be required reading for the man appointed chief cop
by our President to safeguard <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> from illegal narcotics. These are just
a sampling of many works now available that chronical disgraceful conduct by
those sworn to protect and defend our Constitution.</p>

<p>Parting shot Mr. Vice President: On 28 January 1988, General Khun Sa tendered
an offer to turn over to me one metric ton (2200 pounds) of heroin. He says
this is a good faith gesture to the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> people that he is serious about
stopping all drugs coming from the infamous <ent type='ORG'>Golden Triangle</ent>. I you and <ent type='PERSON'>Nancy</ent>
Reagan are really serious about saying "NO" to drugs, why not test Gen Khun
Sa? I challenge you to allow me in the company of agents of your choice to
arrange to receive this token offer worth over $4 billion on the streets of
<ent type='GPE'>New York City</ent>. It will represent the largest "legal" seizure of heroin on
record. You can personally torch it, dump it in the ocean, or turn it into
legal medication; as I understand there is a great shortage of legal opiates
available to our doctors. I think Gen Khun Sa's offer is most interesting.
If you say "YES" then the ever increasing flow of heroin from Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>
(600 tons ) '86, 900 tons ) '87, 1200 tons ) '88) may dry up ) not good for
business in the parallel government and super <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> circles Oliver <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent>
mentioned. If you say "NO" to Khun Sa, you are showing colors not fit for a
man who would be President.</p>

<p>What is your decision? I challenge you to demonstrate exactly where you stand
with respect to big)business)drugs, parallel government, misuse of U.S.
tax)payer dollars in foreign drug suppression programs that don't work, no
interest in dialogue that will stem the flow of illegal narcotics, <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urn of
POWs while they are still alive? I for one am not for a "<ent type='GPE'>USA</ent>, Inc." with you
or anyone else as Chairman of <ent type='ORG'>the Board</ent>.</p>

<p>U.S. Justice Department,
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C. U.S.A.</p>

<p>SUBJECT:A ' AA 8 AA AImportant fact for the Drugs Eradication
Program to be successful.</p>

<p>Sirs:</p>

<p>This letter to the US Justice Department is to make it clear about our deepest
concern in wishing to help eradicate drugs and for all the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> people as
well as the world to know the truth that for the past (15) year they have been
misled to look upon us as the main source of all the drug problems. A A1.
The refusal of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> State government to accept our "SIX YEARS DRUGS
<ent type='ORG'>ERADICATION</ent> PLAN " presented at the <ent type='NORP'>Congressional</ent> Hearing by <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>man Mr.
<ent type='PERSON'>Lester Wolff</ent> after his visit to <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent> in April 1977, was really a great
disappointment for us. Even after this disappointment, we continued writing
letters to President <ent type='PERSON'>Carter</ent> and President Reagan forwarding our sincere wish
to help and participate in eradicating drugs. We are really surprised and
doubtful as to "why the US government refuses our participation and help to
make a success of the drugs eradication program. Furthermore, "why the world
has been misled to accuse us as the main culprit for all the drug trades....
while in reality, we are most sincere and willing to help solve the drug
problems in South East <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>. through our own sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> investigation, we found
out that some high officials in the US government's drugs control and
enforcement department and with the influence of corrupted persons objected to
our active participation in the drugs eradication program of the US government
so as to be able to <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ain their profitable self)interest from the
continuation of the drug problems. Thus, the US government and the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>
people as well as the world have been hoodwinked.</p>

<p>During the period (1965 )1975) <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> Chief in <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent> was in the
drug business, having contacts with <ent type='ORG'>the Opium Warlord Lor Sing</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Han</ent> and his
followers. Santo Trafficante acted as his buying and transporting agent while
<ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent> handled the financial section with the Banks in <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>.
Even after the <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> War ended, when <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent> was being posted to
the US <ent type='ORG'>Embassy</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent>, his dealings in the drug business continued as
before. He was then acting as the US government official concerning with the
drugs problems in South East <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>. After 1979, <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent> resigned from
the US Embassy's posting and set up the "<ent type='ORG'>Far East</ent> Trading Company" as a front
for his continuation in the drug trade and to bribe <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agents in <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent> and
around the world. Soon After, <ent type='PERSON'>Daniel Arnold</ent> was made to handle the drug
business as well as the transportation of arms sales. <ent type='PERSON'>Jerry Daniels</ent> then took
over the drug trade from <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent>. For over 10 years, <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent>
supported his men in <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent> with the profits from his drug trade
and most of the cash were deposited with the banks in <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent> which was to
be used in buying his way for quicker promotions to higher positions. A
<ent type='ORG'>AWithin</ent> the month of July, 1980, Thailand's English newspaper "<ent type='GPE'>Bangkok</ent> Post:
included a news)report that <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agents were using <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent> as a transit)base
for their drug business and the banks in <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent> for depositing,
transferring the large sum of money involved. A <ent type='ORG'>AVerifications</ent> of the news
report can be made by the US Justice Department with <ent type='GPE'>Bangkok</ent> Post and in
<ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>. A AOther facts given herewith have been drawn out from our Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>
Reports files so as to present to you of the real facts as to "why the drug
problem is being prolonged till today." A A3. Finally, we sincerely hope in
the nearest future to be given the opportunity to actively take part in
helping the US government, the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s and people of the world in
eradicating and uprooting the drug problems.</p>

<p> Below, the <ent type='ORG'>Plaintiffs</ent>' attorney, <ent type='PERSON'>Daniel</ent> P. Sheehan, sets forth for the
<ent type='ORG'>Court</ent> in the following <ent type='PERSON'>Affidavit</ent>, the explanation of the evidence presently in

cause" to believe that the <ent type='ORG'>Defendants</ent> named in this federal civil lawsuit are
guilty of the commission of the federal criminal violations set forth in the

<ent type='ORG'>Complaint</ent> if the <ent type='ORG'>Court</ent> deems this to be legally required and that it be deemed
by the <ent type='ORG'>Court</ent> to set forth the evidentiary basis upon which a reasonable person
)) drawing all logical inferences from the facts adduced in the direction of
the <ent type='ORG'>Plaintiffs</ent> )) would conclude that it is more probable than not that each
of the <ent type='ORG'>Defendants</ent> named in this civil suit is guilty of violating the <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent>
RICO Statute and that he is civilly liable to the <ent type='ORG'>Plaintiffs</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Tony Avirgan</ent> and
<ent type='PERSON'>Martha Honey</ent> for having fortuitously contributed to the civil wrongs committed
against them as charged in this Amended <ent type='ORG'>Complaint</ent> )) as Supplemented by the
<ent type='PERSON'>Affidavit</ent> of Counsel.</p>

<p>ATTORNEY DANIEL SHEEHAN'S <ent type='PERSON'>AFFIDAVIT</ent></p>

<p>Now comes Attorney <ent type='PERSON'>Daniel</ent> P. Sheehan, and having been duly sworn hereby swears
and affirms that the following facts are true:</p>

<p>1. I am a duly licensed attorney at law, admitted to practice before the
State and <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Court</ent>s of the State of <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> in both the <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent>ern and

<p>2. I am duly licensed and have been admitted to practice before the
<ent type='ORG'>Court</ent>s of <ent type='GPE'>the District</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Columbia</ent>, both local and <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> and I am in good
standing before both <ent type='ORG'>the Bar</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>the Bar</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>the District</ent> of
<ent type='GPE'>Columbia</ent>.</p>

<p>3. I have practiced law before the courts of <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> and numerous other
states in our nation since 1970, having served as counsel in some 60 separate
pieces of litigation in the states of <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Pennsylvania</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Carolina,
<ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>the District</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Columbia</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Georgia</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Ohio</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Idaho</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Nebraska</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>South Dakota</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Wyoming</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Mississippi</ent>.</p>

<p>4. I graduated from <ent type='ORG'>Harvard</ent> college in 1967 as an Honors Graduate in
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Government, writing my Honors Thesis in the field of Constitutional
Law, and was the <ent type='ORG'>Harvard</ent> University nominee for <ent type='ORG'>the Rhodes Scholarship</ent> from
<ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> in 1967. I graduated from <ent type='ORG'>Harvard</ent> School of Law in 1970, having
served as an Editor of the <ent type='ORG'>Harvard</ent> Civil Rights)Civil Liberties Law Review and
as the Research Associate of Professor <ent type='PERSON'>Jerome Cohen</ent>, the Chair of the
International Law Department of <ent type='ORG'>Harvard</ent>.</p>

<p>5. While at <ent type='ORG'>Harvard</ent> School of Law, I served as a summer associate at the
State Street law firm of <ent type='PERSON'>Goodwin</ent>, Proctor and <ent type='PERSON'>Hoar</ent> under the supervision of
Senior Partner, Donald J. <ent type='ORG'>Hurley</ent>, the President of the <ent type='GPE'>Boston</ent> Chamber of
Commerce and <ent type='GPE'>Massachusetts</ent> Senatorial Campaign Chairman for <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> F. <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent>.
At this firm I participated in the case of <ent type='PERSON'>BAIRD</ent> v <ent type='ORG'>EISENSTAT</ent>, under Roger
Stockey, General Counsel for the <ent type='GPE'>Massachusetts</ent> Planned Parenthood League
(establishing the unconstitutionality of the <ent type='GPE'>Massachusetts</ent> anti)birth control
law) and in the <ent type='GPE'>Nevada</ent> case, under <ent type='PERSON'>Charles Goodhue</ent>, III (establishing the
constitutional right to bail in criminal extradition cases, including capital
cases). While at <ent type='ORG'>Harvard</ent> School of Law, I authored "<ent type='ORG'>The Pedestrian Sources</ent> of
Civil Liberties" in the <ent type='ORG'>Harvard</ent> Civil Rights)Civil Liberties Law Review and I
served under Professor <ent type='PERSON'>Milton Katz</ent>, the President of <ent type='ORG'>the International</ent> Law
Association, as the Chairman of <ent type='ORG'>the Nigerian Biafran Relief Commission</ent>
responsible for successfully negotiating the admission of mercy flights of
food into <ent type='GPE'>Biafra</ent> in 1968.</p>

<p>6. While serving as a legal Associate at the Wall Street law firm of
<ent type='ORG'>Cahill</ent>, Gordon, Sonnett, Rheindle and <ent type='GPE'>Ohio</ent> under partner <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent> and
Thomas <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent> directed <ent type='ORG'>the Phoenix</ent> Project in <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>, in 1974 and 1975, which
carried out the sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> mission of assassinating members of the economic and
political bureaucracy inside <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> to cripple the ability of that nation to
function after the total US withdrawal from <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>. This <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent> Project,
during its history, carried out the political assassination, in <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>, of
some 60000 village mayors, treasurers, school teachers and other non)Viet
Cong administrators. <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent> and Thomas <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent> financed a highly
intensified phase of <ent type='ORG'>the Phoenix</ent> project, in 1974 and 1975, by causing an
intense flow of <ent type='PERSON'>Vang Pao</ent> opium money to be sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ly brought into <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> for
this purpose. This <ent type='PERSON'>Vang Pao</ent> opium money was administered for Theodore
<ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> and Thomas <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent> by a US <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> official based in Saigon's US office
of Naval Operations by the name of <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent>. However, because
<ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent>, Thomas <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent> knew that their sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>

<ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent>, Cambodia, and <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent> in the very near future, they, in 1973, began a
highly sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> non)<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> authorized program Thus, from late 1973 until April of
1975, <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent>, Thomas <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent> disbursed, from
the sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>Laotian</ent>)based, <ent type='PERSON'>Vang Pao</ent> opium fund, vastly more money than was
required to finance even the highly intensified <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent> Project in <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>.
The money in excess of that used in <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> was sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ly smuggled out of
<ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> in large suitcases, by <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Secord</ent> and Thomas <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent> )) and carried
into <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>, where it was deposited in a sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>, personal bank account
(privately accessible to <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent>, Thomas <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Secord</ent>).
During this same period of time between 1973 and 1975, <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent> and
Thomas <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent> caused thousands of tons of US weapons, ammunition, and
explosives to be sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ly taken from <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> and stored at a sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> "cache"
hidden inside <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent>.</p>

<p>The "liaison officer" to <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>the Phoenix</ent> Project in
<ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>, during this 1973 to 1975 period, from the "40 <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>" in the <ent type='ORG'>Nixom</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> was one <ent type='PERSON'>Eric Von Arbod</ent> )) an Assistant Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ary of State for Far

directly with his supervisor <ent type='PERSON'>Henry Kissinger</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>Saigon</ent> fell to the <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>ese in April of 1975. The <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> War was over.</p>

<p>Immediately upon the conclusion of the evacuation of U.S. personnel from
<ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent> was dispatched, by <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent> and Thomas
<ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent>, from <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Tehran</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>. In <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> (the "bursar" for the
<ent type='PERSON'>Vang Pao</ent> opium money for <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent>' planned "Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Team" covert
operations program), between May and August of 1975, set up a sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>
"financial conduit" inside <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>, into which sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Vang Pao</ent> drug funds could
be deposited from Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>. The purpose of this conduit was to serve as
the vehicle for sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> funding by Shackley's "Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Team," of a private,
non)<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> authorized "Black" operations inside <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> )) disposed to seek out,
identify, and assassinate socialist and <ent type='NORP'>communist</ent> sympathizers )) who were
viewed by <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> and his "Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Team" members to be "potential terrorists"
against the Shah of Iran's government in <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>. In late 1975 and early 1976,
<ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent> and Thomas <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent> <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ained <ent type='PERSON'>Edwin Wilson</ent> to travel to <ent type='GPE'>Tehran</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> to head up the "Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Team" covert "anti)terrorist" assassination
program in <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>. This was not a U.S. government)authorized operation. This
was a private operations supervised, directed and participated in by <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent>,
<ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Secord</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> in their purely private capacities.</p>

<p>At the end of 1975, <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent> took the post of a "Special Consultant"
to the U.S. Department of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> regarding <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> military personnel
Missing In Action (<ent type='ORG'>MIA</ent>s) in Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>. In this capacity, <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> was
posted in the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Embassy</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Bangkok</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent>. There <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> had top
responsibility for locating and <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>rieving <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> MIA's in Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>.
He worked at the <ent type='ORG'>Embassy</ent> with an associate, one Jerry O. <ent type='PERSON'>Daniel</ent>s. From 1975
to 1977, <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> held this post in <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent>. However, he did not perform the
duties of this office. Instead, <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> continued to function as the
"bursar" for <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent>'s "Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Team," seeing to it that sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Vang
Pao opium funds were conducted from <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent>, through <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent> to both
<ent type='GPE'>Tehran</ent> and the sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> bank account in <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent> at the Nugen)<ent type='NORP'>Han</ent>d
Bank. The monies conducted by <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Tehran</ent> were to fund <ent type='PERSON'>Edwin Wilson</ent>'s
sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> anti)terrorist "seek and destroy" operation on behalf of Theodore
Shackely. <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> also devoted a portion of his time between 1975 and 1977,
in <ent type='GPE'>Bangkok</ent>, facilitating the escape from <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent>, Cambodia and <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent> and the
re)location elsewhere in the world, of numbers of the sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Meo</ent> tribesmen
group which had carried out the covert political assassination program for
<ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent> in Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent> between 1966 and 1975. Assisting Richard
<ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> in this operation was Jerry O. <ent type='PERSON'>Daniel</ent>s. Indeed, Jerry O. <ent type='PERSON'>Daniel</ent>s was
a "bag)man" for <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent>, assisting <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> by physically
transporting out of <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent> millions of dollars of <ent type='PERSON'>Vang Pao</ent>'s sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> opium
money )) to finance the re)location of <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent>'s <ent type='NORP'>Meo</ent> tribesmen and
to supply funds to <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent>'s "Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Team" operations. At the U.S.
<ent type='ORG'>Embassy</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Bangkok</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent> also supervised the removal of arms,
ammunition and explosives from the sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent>)<ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent> cache of munitions
hidden inside <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent> between 1973 and 1975 )) for use by Shackley's "Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>
Team". Assisting <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> in this latter operations was one <ent type='PERSON'>Daniel Arnold</ent>,
the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> Chief of Station in <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent> )) who joined Shackley's "Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Team" ))
in his purely private capacity.</p>

<p>One of the officers in the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Embassy</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent>, one <ent type='ORG'>Abranowitz</ent> came to
know of Armitage's involvement in the sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> handling of <ent type='PERSON'>Vang Pao</ent> opium funds
and caused to be initiated an internal State Department heroin smuggling
investigations directed against <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> was the target of
<ent type='ORG'>Embassy</ent> personnel complaints to the effect that he was utterly failing to
perform his duties on behalf of <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> <ent type='ORG'>MIA</ent>s, and he reluctantly resigned as
the D.O.D. Special Consultant on MIA's at the end of 1977.</p>

<p>From 1977 until 1979, <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> remained in <ent type='GPE'>Bangkok</ent> opening and operating a
business named The <ent type='ORG'>Far East</ent> Trading Company. This company had offices only in
<ent type='GPE'>Bangkok</ent> and in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C. This company was, in fact, from 1977 to 1979,
merely a "front" for Armitage's sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> operations conducting <ent type='PERSON'>Vang Pao</ent> opium
money out of Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Tehran</ent> and the Nugen)<ent type='NORP'>Han</ent>d Bank in <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent> to
fund the ultra right)wing, private anti)<ent type='NORP'>communist</ent> "anti)terrorist"
assassination program and "unconventional warfare" operation of Theodore
Shackley's and <ent type='PERSON'>Thomas Cline</ent>'s "Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Team". During this period, between 1975
and 1979, in <ent type='GPE'>Bangkok</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent> lived in the home of <ent type='ORG'>Hynnie Aderholdt</ent>
)) the former <ent type='ORG'>Air Wing</ent> Commander of Shackley's "Special Operations Group" in
<ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent> )) who, between 1966 and 1968, had served as the immediate superior to
<ent type='PERSON'>Richard Secord</ent>, the Deputy <ent type='ORG'>Air Wing</ent> Commander of <ent type='ORG'>MAG</ent>)SOG. <ent type='ORG'>Secord</ent>, in 1975,
was transferred from <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Tehran</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>.</p>

<p>In 1976, <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Secord</ent> moved to <ent type='GPE'>Tehran</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> and became the Deputy Assistant
Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ary of defense in <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>, in charge of <ent type='ORG'>the Middle Eastern Division</ent> of the
<ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Security Assistance <ent type='ORG'>Administration</ent>. In this capacity, <ent type='ORG'>Secord</ent>
functioned as the chief operations officer for the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Department in
<ent type='LOC'>the Middle East</ent> in charge of foreign military sales of U.S. aircraft, weapons
and military equipment to <ent type='NORP'>Middle Eastern</ent> nations allied to the U.S.. Secord's
immediate superior was <ent type='PERSON'>Eric Van Marbad</ent> )) the former 40 <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent> liaison
officer to <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent>'s <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent> program in <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> from 1973 to 1975.</p>

<p>From 1976 to 1979, in <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Secord</ent> supervised the sale of U.S.
military aircraft and weapons to <ent type='NORP'>Middle Eastern</ent> nations. However, Richard
<ent type='ORG'>Secord</ent> did not authorize direct nation)to)nation sales of such equipment
directly from the U.S. government to said <ent type='NORP'>Middle Eastern</ent> governments.
Instead, <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Secord</ent> conducted such sales through a "middle)man", one
<ent type='PERSON'>Albert Hakim</ent>. By the use of middle)man <ent type='PERSON'>Albert Hakim</ent>, Deputy Assistant
Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ary of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Secord</ent> purchased U.S. military aircraft and
weapons from the U.S. governament at the low "manufacturer's cost" )) but sold
these U.S. aircraft and weapons to the client <ent type='NORP'>Middle Eastern</ent> nations at the
much higher "replacement cost". <ent type='ORG'>Secord</ent> then caused to be paid to the U.S.
government, out of the actual sale price obtained, only the lower amount equal
to the lower manufacturer's cost. The difference, was sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ed from the U.S.
government and <ent type='ORG'>Secord</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Albert Hakim</ent> sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ly transferred these millions of
dollars into Shackley's "Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Team" operations inside <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> )) and into
Shackley's sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Nugen)<ent type='NORP'>Han</ent>d bank account in <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>. Thus, by 1976,
Defendant <ent type='PERSON'>Albert Hakim</ent> had become a partner with Thomas <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Secord</ent>
and <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent> in <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent>'s "Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Team".</p>

<p>Between 1976 and 1979, <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Secord</ent>, Hakim, <ent type='PERSON'>Wilson</ent>, and <ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent>
set up several corporations and subsidiaries around the world through which to
conceal the operations of the "Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Team". Many of these corporations were
set up in <ent type='GPE'>Switzerland</ent>. Some of these were: (1) <ent type='ORG'>Lake Resources</ent>, Inc.; (2) The
Stanford Technology Trading Group, Inc.; and (3) Companie de Services
Fiduciaria. Other companies were set up in Central <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, such as: (4) CSF,

Through these corporations, members of <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent>'s "Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Team"

<p>U.S. DRUG TRAFFICKING:
<ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent> REPORT</p>

<p>My team mate, Mr. <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent></ent>, and I infiltrated <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> in November-December
1986 in cooperation with the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> to ascertain whether or not heroin
"king-pin" Khun Sa had access to U.S. Prisoners of War as was reported. 1;e
found no POWs, but Khun Sa agreed to send patrols throughout western <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent> to
check for POW presence. During our interview with him, he stated he wanted to
eliminate the 700-900, tons of opium/heroin that is trafficked through his
area (the <ent type='ORG'>Golden Triangle</ent>") each year. He stated that he would also expose
U.S. Government officials involved in the drug trafficking. Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent> and I
<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urned to the U.S. in December 1986. I submitted the video taped
conversations to the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>, excited about the potential dialogue on drug
suppression. I received a telephone call from my <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> liaison, lauding
our successful interview with drug warlord Khun Sa who had previously been
reported killed by the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>. When asked about the reaction and planned response
to Khun Sa's proposal to eliminate drug flow into the free world I was told,
"There is no interest here in doing that". This seemed most strange, since
Vice-President <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> is appointed as the nations top policeman for drug
control. Immediately thereafter, my partner (Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent>) was arrested. He was
told by federal agents and members of the attorney general s office that I was
the true target of an investigation connecting me with <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> misdeeds
(i.e., Oliver <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> etc.). A proffer was made that guaranteed Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent>
probation without supervision, so that he could join me oVerseas in the
on-going POW liberation effort. Instead of this, <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent></ent> was subsequently
sentenced to 5 years in prison for a technical violation of the law, which act
several federal offices and authorities admitted having sanctioned.
Simultaneously, the U.S. Government criticized <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> for failure
to destroy Khun Sa , and declared no mercy . The ambassador for narcotic
control went to <ent type='GPE'>Bangkok</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent> and announced: "The U.S. will never
negotiate with the free world's worst enemy, Khun Sa." For 60 days, newspapers
in <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent> headlined the efforts of tens of thousands of <ent type='NORP'>Thai</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Burmese</ent>
troops deployed against Khun Sa's stronghold.</p>

<p>I <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urned to <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> to visit Khun Sa in May 1987, and see if he would release
his information on corrupt and drug dealing U.S. officials. Instead of
finding a war zone in his area, I found a new road, built by the <ent type='NORP'>Thai</ent>
government - with heavy equipment, leading directly to Khun Sa s <ent type='GPE'>Shan</ent> State
headquarters. When questioned about the lack of evidence of any bomb, bullet,
damage to the heavy-duty truck route, he laughed at the headlines we d seen
and explained: "It was only a newspaper war." I observed thousands of teak
trees along the entryway on the <ent type='NORP'>Thai</ent> side of the border. Obviously, Khun Sa
had traded teak to the <ent type='NORP'>Thai</ent>s'' for a 'phony' war and high-speed road. The
<ent type='NORP'>Thai</ent>s and <ent type='NORP'>Burmese</ent> were praised by the U.S. Government, insuring millions in
drug suppression funds.</p>

<p>During our eight-day stay, Khun Sa and his staff gave us names of past and
present U.S. officials involved in drug buying and trafficking.</p>

<p>It is unconscionable that <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> tax payers are funding millions on a
suppression program infected with corrupt officials. Drug traffic has steadily
increased each year. In 1986 it was estimated at 700 tons of opium/heroin.
This year - with the new road - Khun Sa should reach his stated goal of 900
tons. Khun Sa says that for one tenth of the <ent type='NORP'>Burmese</ent> drug suppression money,
he will use his 40000-man army to completely eliminate all opium/heroin
traffic through the <ent type='ORG'>Golden Triangle</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Shan</ent> territory. His desire is to
safeguard his 8 million <ent type='GPE'>Shan</ent> people from the <ent type='NORP'>Burmese</ent> spraying of "Agent
Orange" defoliant on <ent type='GPE'>Shan</ent> State crops, animals and people. He seeks
recognition of <ent type='GPE'>Shan</ent>land through politically-recognized negotiations that would
have given independence to <ent type='GPE'>Shan</ent>land from <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> in 1957. The <ent type='NORP'>Burmese</ent> refuse to
release this territory, and continue to overtly suppress the population.
<ent type='GPE'>Shan</ent>land (160000 square miles) comprises 40% of the <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> landmass and it is
estimated that 80% of the <ent type='NORP'>Burmese</ent> economy comes from the natural resources of
the <ent type='GPE'>Shan</ent> States.</p>

<p>The attached tapes and news copies detail this story. Additionally, 8mm sound
movies, stills, video masters and accompanying audio are available.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that Khun Sa has been besieged by corrupt U.S. ploys,
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent></ent> has been railroaded, and I myself have been federally indicted
for use of a false passport. Now that I have been to <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> and learned who in
the U.S. Government Executive Branch have been involved with drug trafficking,
it is easy to understand the frantic efforts to prevent disclosure of this
report.</p>

<p>NINE HUNDRED TONS OF HEROIN &amp; <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> WILL ENTER THE FREE WORLD FROM SOUTHEAST
ASIA'S "GOLDEN TRIANGLE" THIS YEAR. The reason is because U.S. taxpayer
dollars and <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> equipment have been used to construct a new road that
will allow narcotics to pour out of General Khun Sa's <ent type='GPE'>Shan</ent> Territories rather
than trickle out by horse and mule as has been the case until the beginning of
this year.</p>

<p>Last year 600 tons of Opiates trafficked from this area. <ent type='ORG'>Press</ent> reports
included as part of this statement argue that it is logistically impossible to
increase the output to 900 toins. The new road capable of easily handling 10
ton truck convoys signal not only the capability, but the reality. The
disappointing fact is that this new artery was constructed by the <ent type='NORP'>Thai</ent>
Government using money, manpower, time and materials furnished by our drug
suppression funds.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are serious implications that elements within the U.S.
Government are Khun Sa's biggest customers. The facts are that for 15 years
U.S. taxpayers through legislative bodies like this committee and executive
agencies such as have testified here today, have dumped hundres of millions of
dollars into drug suppression programs within <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> which have
done nothing but nourish the flow of narcotics from <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent> into <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent>
States. The proof is statistically clear. Fifteen years ago the flow of
Opiates was 60 tons; this year it will approach or exceed 900 tons. The
reasons, while multi)faceted, boil down to one word, "money".</p>

<p>Certain high level <ent type='NORP'>Thai</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Burmese</ent> officials are packing their pockets with
U.S. supplied drug suppression funds; political pay*offs, and other spin)off
profits like the thousands of Teak trees felled during the Khun Sa road
effort. Khun Sa has no outlet for teak, but it is a protected and highly
valued commodity in <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent>. More shameful are the serious allegations
raised by General Khun Sa and his staff that corrupt U.S. officials allow this
travesty and in certain cases are directly involved.</p>

<p>After meeting with General Khun Sa and others, I am convinced that a sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>
combination exists today within the U.S. Government that was officially
germinated during the <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> ) <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> years and has, through illicit drug
profits, propagated itself today into a self)serving righteous monster of
global proportions. I believe Ed <ent type='PERSON'>Wilson</ent> was a member of this combination and
that his activities represent only one of many tentacles. I believe the
<ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent>)<ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> situation is merely another visible lesion that has emerged
from this extra)governmental organism.</p>

<p>I say "would be righteous" because those within this sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> combination I
believe honestly think they are serving <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> by offering an established
model of sabotage, subversion, and assassination to areas threatened by
communism. They are in existence because normal government process is too
cumbersome, time consuming and oft times impotent. These persons who are
intelligent and well seeded in our governmental structure think they are
smarter than our elected officials and can expedite accomplishment of national
objectives. They have funded their efforts through drug trafficking because
of a 1960's mind set that anyone who would use opiates is animalistic and the
U.S.A. doesn't really care about them. They began their drug dealing in
Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent> as a means to fund the sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> war in <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent> and Cambodia that
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> was officially unaware of. Besides my personal experiences, all of
these conclusions are spelled out in the book, THE POLITICS OF HEROIN IN
SOUTHEAST ASIA.</p>

<p>I have good reason to believe that after President <ent type='PERSON'>Nixon</ent> got the U.S. out of
<ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>e "with honor", while bringing home "all the POW's" in 1973 that either
with his concurrance, or on the initiative of those "Best and Brightest"
included within the "President's 40", the war continued to be fought through
Project <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent>. The insiders knew the <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>ese would not abide by
the tri)accord and continue to consolidate their position in <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent>,
and Cambodia. Since the war was over there was no <ent type='NORP'>Congressional</ent> funding and
home)grown drug trafficking offered the most expedient solution. Ideally the
<ent type='NORP'>communist</ent> takeover in 1975 would fall like a house)of)cards since the
infrastructure would be eliminated by extreme prejudice through <ent type='ORG'>the Phoenix</ent>
operation. Even so, an estimated 150000 non)military persons were
terminated, the program failed to meet the expectations of those in charge.</p>

<p>Next, I believe <ent type='ORG'>the Phoenix</ent> model was moved to help stabilize a toppling <ent type='PERSON'>Shaw</ent>
who happened to be close to the <ent type='ORG'>Administration</ent> ) and to people in the sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>
combination society, many of whom held high positions within the Executive
Branch. The <ent type='PERSON'>Shaw</ent> fell. By this time the model was self)perpetuating.</p>

<p>Rather than shut down after failing in <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>, there was a re*focus on the
building <ent type='NORP'>communist</ent> threat in Central <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. The <ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent>)<ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>)Oliver
<ent type='PERSON'>North</ent>)<ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> disclosures are only protrusions that have become visible
because of the extent and intensity of this para)government organization.
Even as these hearings are underway, representatives of this sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>
combination are at work in the "<ent type='GPE'>Philippines</ent>, offering "anti)<ent type='NORP'>communist</ent>
solutions" to that struggling democracy. I believe that.</p>

<p>As years and changing administrations have gradually thinned
the society's active duty status within the U.S. Government, I
believe those who still steer the society have become more self*serving, making huge personal profitunder the guise of fighting
worldwide communism. Further, I believe they are maximizing their\j\influence to protect those of t brotherhood who still hold active
office in the government.</p>

<p>I have been told for years that U.S. POW's would never be allowed to <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urn
because they were directly related to illegal drug trafficking by U.S.
officials. Until May of 1987, I thought this absurd. Now, after eight years
in the POW)Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>n arena, I clearly can see what was hidden except to
those more sensitive to power politics than myself. The reason we have met
the enemy and he is U.S. in our efforts to <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urn POWs while they are still
alive is simple. When POWs are <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urned the first demand by the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>
people will be to examine those within the government responsible for their
<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urn. <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> will want to know why these individuals failed in their
official capactities; why the burden fell on the private sector; and what took
so long if the POW issue is truly "Top National Priority" as designated by
President Reagan. Upon investigation it will be revealed that responsible
officials were more interested in actuating their sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> society than
accounting for our POW and <ent type='ORG'>MIA</ent>.</p>

<p>The fact is that all of <ent type='ORG'>the Heroin and Opiates</ent> could be shut off at the Golden
Triangle if America's responsible elected and appointed officials would do
their job. General Khun Sa is recognized as the drug king)pin and controls
the <ent type='ORG'>Golden Triangle</ent> with a well disciplined army of 40000 <ent type='GPE'>Shan</ent> soldiers. He
has stated to me before three other <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> witnesses on video tape that he
greatly desires to stop the drug trafficking, but we won't let him. He has
promised that if we will give him any economic alternative, he will not just
stem, but stop the flow of narcotics through his areas of control. He has
said for example that for one)tenth the money we now give the <ent type='NORP'>Burmese</ent> for drug
suppression turned into economic aid and crop substitution, he will use his
force to enforce what we cannot and have not. In addition, Khun Sa has
stipulated that the <ent type='NORP'>Burmese</ent> must be stopped from using the 12 <ent type='ORG'>Bell Helicopters</ent>
and fixed wing aircraft given them by the U.S. to spray the <ent type='GPE'>Shan</ent> State people,
animals, food and water with Agent Orange and herbicides. All that I have
presented thus far is backed up by written and recorded documents made
available to the <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>.</p>

<p>It has been reported to me by committee personnel that Khun Sa has made these
offers before. They say the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> has expressed doubt and mistrust that Khun Sa
will carry out his part of the bargain. I and three other <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s have met
with Khun Sa. We all believe him to be sincere. Certainly in view of the
dismal failure of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>DEA</ent> to slow, stop or even deter the flood of
drugs from the <ent type='ORG'>Golden Triangle</ent>, it seems that a change in dynamics is in
order. Especially since Khun Sa has directly implicated persons within the
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> as some of his best customers. The video tapes show testimony of a
frustrated medical doctor who, under orders from Khun Sa, did everything from
offer radio links to Khun Sa's headquarters to present a horse that might be
used to alert <ent type='ORG'>DEA</ent> of drug movements. The low level agents supported these
initatives, but in every case they were rejected at <ent type='ORG'>DEA</ent> headquarter levels.
\j\</p>

<p> I have strived at the invitation of <ent type='ORG'>the Executive Branch</ent> for eight
years to convince political skeptics that <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> POWs are alive in the hands
of <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> forces in <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>. I abhore drugs and dopes that are
users, yet in the past two weeks I've been told by committee staff and others
that "federal sources and a <ent type='ORG'>Los Angeles</ent> State Department employee have said
that I am a "drug trafficker", and I will be in prison before July 4th. I
know this level of federal employee would never make such slanderous
statements unless encouraged by higher)ups. While following the classic model
of "deny)defame)divert," it is disappointing that law enforcement agencies
would reveal such low life practices as directly as they have, and then avoid
comment when confronted.</p>

<p>I have tried in every way to cooperate with the committee and its membership.
I've furnished video tapes, only to be informed that the chairman has blocked
their distribution. I've supplied the Suchesk letter to Vice President <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>,
and requested a written transcript of the file from which Khun Sa's sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ary
read from. I received a letter in the mail last week. It was from Khun Sa.
The stapled and sealed envelope had been opened. Inside, the pamphlet, which
had also been stapled shut, had been opened and the contents removed. I had
asked Khun Sa to translate his record; sign it himself with two additional
witnesses. I was assured this document was part of the opened package. I
have requested my contacts furnish me with a FAX of their copy. It serves to
supplement in writing the verbal and video accounts.</p>

<p>I'm disillusioned that this committee which represents the interest of 240
million <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s in controling illegal drug trafficking, would take such a
negative and skeptical position on such a critical issue as Khun Sa's proposal
and my deliverance of the information he gave us. I've been told that I must
"sell my case" to you. Facts are, I am a citizen who has been twice to see a
warlord who is recognized as the world's most powerful Heroin kingpin. This
person has shown statistically that our 15 year old drug suppression program
is, at best, "dumb" by anyone's standards. At best we have millions of US tax
dollars being mishandled; one recipient has made use of U.S. assets to build a
major road, and secures that road from outside infiltration; 900 tons of
opiates entering the free world; rampant corruption of allied officials. At
worst in addition to the best case, we have officials within the <ent type='ORG'>USG</ent> who
won't, as Khun Sa says, let him get out of the drug business, because they are
his biggest buyers.</p>

<p>Your business is representing <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> interest in drug control. You greatly
influence how our tax dollars are used and how well the enforcement agencies
do their job. My business is bringing home POWs while they are still alive.
Neither one of us has been able to make much head way because I'm convinced
there are persons within the government that are opposing us both. If POWs
came home, the resulting investigation will expose their drug involvement; if
the drugs are stopped, their source of income dries up. I agree that
communism threatens the liberty of free people everywhere, but in my opinion
drugs are even a bigger and more immediate threat. To\j\fuel these
self)righteous freedom fighters with drug money is to steal, cheat, and
mislead every <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> taxpayer, and circumnavigate the greatest governmental
system in the world. While it may appear slow, and at times fickle and
indecisive, still our's is the greatest government in the world. There aren't
boat loads of <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s headed for <ent type='GPE'>the Soviet Union</ent>. I believe our system was
divinely inspired. I believe it will work despite any shortcoming.</p>

<p>As a member of <ent type='ORG'>The Church</ent> of Jesus Christ of Latter)Day Saints with Temple
Endowments, I raise my hand to the square and swear before God, Angels, and
you as witnesses, that this statement is the absolute truth as I know it. I
hope you can swear before God that you will execute the responsibilities to
your constituents with all honesty in thoroughly investigating the proposal
for eliminating all drug trafficking from the <ent type='ORG'>Golden Triangle</ent>, and seeing to
the objective investigation and prosecution of any <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> officials found to
be guilty of maliciously dealing in drugs. I personally don't believe the
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s named by Khun Sa as conspiritors in <ent type='GPE'>traffickings</ent> could pass an
honest security background check. I believe if you do your job as our
representative body, you will uncover and topple those members of this sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>
combination like a line of dominos. If you give this hearing only a cameo
appearance, the combination will be strengthened and our nation could be in
for a period like the <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> era. Your positive attention to this matter
should also speed the safe <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urn of our POWs.</p>

<p>I believe we can stop the heroin and opium by working with <ent type='PERSON'>Kuhn</ent> Sa instead of
against him. At worst we lose 10 percent of the <ent type='NORP'>Burmese</ent> Socialist State
suppression funds. You don't have to be from <ent type='GPE'>Las Vegas</ent> to recognize Khun Sa's
offer as a good bet. I believe in him and that he will keep his word. We
can't hardly afford not to take the chance. I believe the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> public
would be outraged to discover we by)passed such an opportunity because people
who are suspect as traffickers say they "don't trust Khun Sa." Their line
should be added to other greats such as, "I'm from the government, I'm here to
help you"; and "your check is in the mail."</p>

germain documents that attest to the allegations made in the video tapes.</p>

<p>1: A PROPOSAL TO ERADICATE <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> IN THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>

<p>THE <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> STATE IN <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent>, (APPROXIMATELY <ent type='GPE'>THREE</ent> <ent type='ORG'>TIME</ent>S THE SIZE OF TAIWAN) HAD
BEEN UNDER <ent type='NORP'>BRITISH</ent> PROTECTION PRIOR TO 1948. THE <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> PEOPLE, POPULATION OF 8
MILLION, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF KHUN SA SIGNED AN AGREE<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>T TO UNIFY WITH THE
BURMESE GOVERN<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>T IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INDEPENDENCE FROM THE <ent type='NORP'>BRITISH</ent>. THE
PINLONG AGREE<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>T , REGISTERED WITH THE UNITED NATIONS, CONTAINED A CONTAINED
A CONDITION THAT WOULD ALLOW THE <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> PEOPLE TO FREELY SECEDE FROM <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent> <ent type='ORG'>AFT</ent>ER
A <ent type='ORG'>TEN YEAR</ent> PERIOD AND BECOME AN INDEPENDENT STATE.</p>

<p>WHEN GENERAL NE WIN, A SO<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>LIST, TOOK OVER <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent> HE <ent type='ORG'>ABOLISHED</ent> THE PINLONG
AGREE<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>T AND OPENED THE DOOR FOR THE <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent> COMMUNIST PARTY TO <ent type='ORG'>GAIN</ent> A STRONG
HOLD IN THE COUNTRY. IT WAS AT THIS <ent type='ORG'>TIME</ent> THAT <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>REBELLION</ent> FOR INDEPENDENCE
BEGAN.</p>

<p>IN EARLY 1949 <ent type='ORG'>THE COMMUNIST PARTY</ent> OF <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent> MOVED INTO THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES
OF THE <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> STATE AND ESTABLISHED MILITARY STRONGHOLDS WHILE ENGAGING IN THE
BUSINESS OF; <ent type='PERSON'>OPIUM CULTIVATION</ent>, PROCESSING, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE. IN 1950
REMNANTS OF <ent type='PERSON'>CHAING KAI</ent>)SHEK'S <ent type='ORG'>KMT</ent> <ent type='ORG'>ARMY</ent> MOVED FROM <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>MAINLAND</ent> <ent type='GPE'>CHINA</ent> INTO</ent> THE SAME
AREA. THEY ALSO ESTABLISHED STRONGHOLDS AND FREELY ENGAGED IN THE <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent>
BUSINESS TO SUPPORT THEIR ARMIES.</p>

<p>tHE <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> PEOPLE, ON THE VERGE OF STARVATION, FOUND THEMSELVES SURROUNDED AND
OPPRESSED BY <ent type='ORG'>THE COMMUNIST PARTY</ent> OF <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent>, THE <ent type='ORG'>KMT</ent> ARMIES AND A VARIETY OF
RENEGADE <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> WARLORDS. ALL THE FACTIONS FREELY ROAMED THE <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> TERRITORY
PRESSING <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> PEOPLE INTO THEIR SERVICE AS FARMERS, <ent type='ORG'>PORTERS</ent> AND GUIDES. THESE
FORCES SHARED LITTLE OF THEIR FINAN<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>L <ent type='ORG'>GAIN</ent>S WITH THE <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> POPULATION, BUT
WERE FREE TO DISPENSE TORTURE, RAPE AND MURDER TO ALL WHO WOULD NOT CO)OPERATE
WITH THEM. TO PROVIDE FOOD AND FREEDOM FOR HIS PEOPLE, KHUN SA ORGANIZED HIS
<ent type='ORG'>ARMY</ent> AND TURNED TO <ent type='PERSON'>OPIUM CULTIVATION</ent> FOR HIS INCOME.</p>

<p>AS THE YEARS PASSED KHUN SA <ent type='ORG'>GAIN</ent>ED MILITARY SUPERIORITY IN THE <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> STATE. HE
BEGAN TO SLOWLY PHASE OUT THE)CULTIVATION OF <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> AMONG THE <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> POPULATION.
TO REPLACE THAT BLOCK OF INCOME HE STARTED TO COLLECT TAXES WHILE PROVIDING
SAFE TRANSPORTATION AND PASSAGE THROUGH HIS TERRITORY TO THE DAILY CARAVANS OF
NARCOTIC TRAFFICKERS ON THEIR WAY TO THE SOUTHERN OUTLETS OF <ent type='GPE'>THAILAND</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>TODAY</ent>, KHUN SA STILL HAS SOME SMALL ISOLATED POCKETS OF <ent type='PERSON'>OPIUM CULTIVATION</ent>
AMONG THE <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> PEOPLES. HE IS ATTEMPTING TO ERADICATE THESE FIELDS AS QUICKLY
AS HE CAN PROVIDE ALTERNATE INCOME PROGRAMS FOR HIS FARMERS.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL:</p>

<p>KHUN SA IS PREPARED TO IMPLE<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>T A PHASE OUT PROGRAM TO COMPLETELY STOP THE
CULTIVATION OF <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> IN THE <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> TERRITORIES. HE IS PREPARED TO ESTABLISH A
MILITARY CONTROL SYSTEM TO COMPLETELY STOP THE PASSAGE OR NARCOTIC TRAFFICKERS
FROM <ent type='GPE'>CHINA</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent> AND <ent type='LOC'>LAOS</ent> ON THEIR TRAVELS TO THE <ent type='GPE'>THAILAND</ent> OUTLETS THROUGH
THE <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> TERRITORIES.</p>

<p>TO IMPLE<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>T THIS PROPOSAL, KHUN SA STATES THAT HE COULD MAINTAIN MILITARY
CONTROL AND SURVEILLANCE IN THAT AREA FOR ABOUT HALF THE COST OF THE CURRENT
U.S. BUDGET EXPENDED BY THE D.E.A. FORCES NOW STATIONED IN <ent type='GPE'>THAILAND</ent>. A
PROPOSAL TO REALIZE INCOME FOR HIS PEOPLE THROUGH THE SALE OF THE TERRITORIES
NATURAL RESOURCES WILL BE PRESENTED IN ITEM # FOUR, "TRADE MISSION".</p>

<p>2: THE CORRUPTION OF THAI, <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent> AND D.E.A. OFFI<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>LS.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>

<p> THE NARCOTIC ENFORCE<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>T OPERATIONAL STAFFS OF <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>THAILAND</ent> AND THE U.S.
D.E.A. HAVE FOR YEARS ATTEMPTED TO STOP THE FLOW OF NARCOTICS FROM THE GOLDEN
TRIANGLE AREA. LARGE BUDGETS ARE EXPENDED BY OUR GOVERN<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>T TO SUPPORT THESE
ACTIVITIES WHICH RANGE FROM THE COLLECTION OF INTELLIGENCE TO THE OCCASIONAL
BOMBING, RAIDING AND BURNING OF SOME ISOLATED <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> PRODUCING FIELDS. IN ALL
THE TOTAL PROGRAM HAS NOT <ent type='ORG'>MET</ent> WITH ANY APPRE<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>BLE SUCCESS.</p>

<p>tHE <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent> GOVERN<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>T, FUNDED BY THE D.E.A., HAVE ENGAGED IN A SERIES OF
INDISCRIMINATING BOMBING RAIDS ON SUSPECTED <ent type='ORG'>VILLAGES</ent> KILLING AND WOUNDING
COUNTLESS INNOCENT WO<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent> AND CHILDREN. THEY HAVE <ent type='ORG'>SPRAYED OPIUM</ent> FIELDS AND
<ent type='ORG'>VILLAGES</ent> WITH CHEMICAL THAT NOT ONLY KILL THE VEGETATION BUT ALSO POISON THE
SURROUNDING WATER SUPPLIES AND SUBSEQUENT NEW PLANT GROWTH. HUNDREDS OF
VILLAGERS HAVE SUFFERED CRUEL AND SLOW <ent type='ORG'>DEA</ent>THS BY DRINKING POLLUTED
WATERS\j\AND <ent type='ORG'>EAT</ent>ING NEWLY GROWN VEGETABLES RAISED IN POISONED FIELDS. 082986</p>

<p>THAI AND D.E.A. CORRUPT OFFI<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>LS ARE USING U.S. FUNDS TO PURCHASE NARCOTICS
FOR RE SALE, SELLING U.S. ARMS TO KHUN SA'S FORCES AND ARE INVOLVED IN A HOST
OF OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVES. AS LONG AS THESE CORRUPT OPERATIONS CONTINUE , IT
WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE THE <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> OPERATIONS IN THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL:</p>

<p>KHUN SA IS PREPARING HARD DOCU<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>TATION OF THE CORRUPT ACTS OF THE THAI AND
D.E.A. OFFI<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>LS CONCERNED. HE PROPOSES THAT THE U.S. GOVERN<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>T WITHDRAW THE
CORRUPT D.E.A. PERSONNEL FROM THAT OPERATIONAL AREA AND REPLACE THEM WITH A
NEW CADRE OF TRUSTED U.S. GOVERN<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>T AGENTS. KHUN SA WELCOMES THE CONCEPT OF
HAVING OBSERVERS TO MONITOR HIS NARCOTIC <ent type='ORG'>ERADICATION</ent> ACTIVITIES IN THE <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent>
TERRITORIES.</p>

<p>3: <ent type='GPE'>AMERICA</ent>N M.I.A./P.O.W.'S IN <ent type='LOC'>LAOS</ent>.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND</p>

<p> DURING THE RAINY SEASON IN THE LATE 1978 KHUN SA'S FORCES FOUND 4 U.S. M/I/A/
PERSONNEL IN THE NORTHERN JUNGLES OF <ent type='LOC'>LAOS</ent>. HIS FORCES ESCORTED THE 4 <ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent> TO
THE <ent type='ORG'>MEKONG</ent> RIVER. WHILE ATTEMPTING TO CROSS THE RAIN SWOLLEN RIVER, THE 4
U.S. PERSONNEL. <ent type='GPE'>THREE</ent> OF KHUN SA'S SOLDIERS AND TWO HORSES WERE SWEPT AWAY BY
THE RAGING WATERS AND ALL WERE DROWNED.</p>

<p>KHUN SA HAS HAD REP<ent type='ORG'>EAT</ent>ED INTELLIGENCE REPORTS OF THE LOCATION OF U.S. AND
FOREIGN PERSONNEL HELD CAPTIVE IN <ent type='LOC'>LAOS</ent>. HAVING NO SPE<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>L USE FOR THIS
INFORMATION, IT WAS IGNORED.</p>

<p>AT MY REQUEST, KHUN SA CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF SOME 70 U.S. M.I.A./P.O.W.'S
AND APPROXIMATELY 12 <ent type='ORG'>KOREANS</ent>, 5 <ent type='ORG'>FILIPINOS</ent> AND A HOST OF <ent type='LOC'>LAOS</ent>IAN'S BEING
CONFINED IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS. ONE GROUP IS WORKING AS FORCED LABORERS IN A
GOLD MINE IN THE NORTHERN SECTOR OF <ent type='LOC'>LAOS</ent>. THIS INFORMATION WAS INDEPENDENTLY
CONFIRMED IN MY <ent type='GPE'>MEET</ent>ING WITH THE LEADERS OF THE UNITED LAO PEOPLE FRONT FOR
THE LIBERATION OF <ent type='LOC'>LAOS</ent>. (<ent type='ORG'>UFLLL</ent>).</p>

<p>PROPOSAL:</p>

<p>KHUN SA AS A GESTURE OF HIS <ent type='ORG'>SINCERITY</ent> AND GOODWILL TO <ent type='ORG'>THE PEOPLE</ent> OF <ent type='GPE'>AMERICA</ent>,
AND ESPE<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>LLY TO THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S.A. IS PREPARED
TO RESCUE THE <ent type='GPE'>AMERICA</ent>N PERSONNEL AND DELIVER THEM SAFELY INTO OUR HANDS. HE
WILL DO THIS EMPLOYING HIS OWN TROOPS AND FUNDS, ASKING ONLY FOR SOME SMALL
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF SOME RIVER CROSSING EQUIP<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>T AND AN AIR
EVACUATION FORCE TO REMOVE THE <ent type='GPE'>AMERICA</ent>NS FROM HIS TERRITORY. \j\</p>

<p> PRIOR TO MY DEPARTURE FROM HO)MONG, KHUN SA DISPATCHED RECON
TEAMS TO OBTAIN HARD PHOTOGRAPHIC AND POSSIBLE INDIVIDUAL I.D.
CONFIRMATIONS FROM THE VARIOUS PRISONER SITES.

<p>4: REGISTRATION OF A TRADE MISSION:</p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent>LAND HAS VAST RICH NATIONAL RESOURCES. IF PROPERLY MANAGED AND PRESENTED
TO THE WORLD MARKET, THESE RESOURCES COULD PROVIDE THE FUNDING FOR KHUN SA'S
<ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> <ent type='ORG'>ERADICATION</ent> PROGRAM AND MAINTAIN THE ONGOING ECONOMY FOR THE <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent>
POPULACE.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL:</p>

<p>KHUN SA HAS <ent type='PERSON'>COMMISSIONED THE UNDERSIGNED</ent> TO ESTABLISH TRADE MISSIONS IN THE
FREE WORLD. A REQUEST FOR THE SUPPORT OF <ent type='GPE'>THE UNITED STATES</ent> IN RECOGNIZING THE
TRADE MISSION IS MADE BY KHUN SA IN A TAPED MESSAGE TO THE VICE PRESIDENT . A

<p>5: HERBAL MEDICAL CURE FOR NARCOTIC ADDICTS.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>

<p>IN THE 1800'S THE <ent type='NORP'>BRITISH</ent> INTRODUCED <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> INTO <ent type='ORG'>MAINLAND</ent> <ent type='GPE'>CHINA</ent>. A CHINESE
HERB DOCTOR, ALARMED AT THE GROWING NUMBER OF NARCOTIC ADDICTS, DEVELOPED A
MIXTURE OF HERBS USED TO CURE ADDICTS OF THEIR CRAVINGS FOR NARCOTICS. THE
PROCESS STARTED WITH THE INGESTION OF A SMALL QUANTITY OF THE HERBAL MIXTURE.
THE ADDICT THEN EXPERIENCED 12 TO 15 HOURS OF SLEEP. FOR <ent type='ORG'>THE NEXT FEW DAYS</ent>
THE ADDICT DETOXIFIED BY PASSING THE BODY POISONS THROUGH THE URINE AND SW<ent type='ORG'>EAT</ent>
GLANDS. <ent type='ORG'>AFT</ent>ER <ent type='EVENT'>LESS THAN ONE WEEK</ent> , THE ADDICT WOULD BEGIN TO <ent type='ORG'>EAT</ent> NORMALLY AND
BEGIN TO <ent type='ORG'>GAIN</ent> WEIGHT. MOST TR<ent type='ORG'>EAT</ent><ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>TS TOOK BETWEEN SEVEN TO TEN DAYS TO
COMPLETE. UPON COMPLETION, THE FORMER ADDICT WAS READY TO RETURN TO HIS
NORMAL LIFE DUTIES, HAVING LOST ALL CRAVINGS AND DESIRES FOR ANY DRUGS.</p>

<p>THIS PROCESS IS STILL IN USE <ent type='GPE'>TODAY</ent>. A SPE<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>L CLINIC IN BANGKOK HAS TR<ent type='ORG'>EAT</ent>ED
OVER 10000 ADDICTS USING THE SAME HERBAL MIXTURE AS PASSED ON BY THE OLD
CHINESE DOCTOR.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL:</p>

<p>KHUN SA HAS OFFERED THIS FORMULA AND PROCESS TO THE U.S.A. AND THE FREE WORLD
AS THE F<ent type='ORG'>IRS</ent>T OFFERING TO BE PASSED THROUGH THE TRADE MISSION. PRODUCT
VALIDITY SUPPORT OF THE TESTING OF SAMPLES AND ENDORSE<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>T BY THE U.S. DEPT.
OF HEALTH IS REQUESTED. 082986</p>

<p>SUMMARY:</p>

<p>KHUN SA IS EXTREMELY DESIROUS TO ALIGNING HIS PEOPLE WITH <ent type='GPE'>THE UNITED STATES</ent> OF
<ent type='GPE'>AMERICA</ent>. THE <ent type='ORG'>RUSSIANS</ent> HAVE BOMBARDED HIM WITH OFFERS OF ECONOMIC AND MILITARY
AID. HE IS RESISTING THEIR TEMPTING OFFERS, AND WHILE HE HAS AGREED TO SEND
80 YOUNG STUDENTS TO RUSSIA FOR TRAINING, WILL STOP THE ACTIVITY UPON SEEING
ANY OVERT OR COVERT EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT FROM THE U.S.A.</p>

<p>KHUN SA HAS EXPRESSED IN LENGTH HIS NEED AND CONCERNS FOR THE ORDERLY
TRANSITION OF <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent>LAND INTO AN INDEPENDENT STATE. A NEW PROPOSAL PLAN WAS
DISCUSSED, AND WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE VICE PRESIDENT IN PERSON BY THE
<ent type='ORG'>UNDERSIGNED</ent>.</p>

<p>IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT IN A SHORT <ent type='ORG'>SPAN</ent> OF <ent type='ORG'>TIME</ent> SOME MESSAGE BE SENT BACK TO
KHUN SA REGARDING THE U.S. POSITION ON THE MATTERS LISTED HEREIN. IF WE FAIL
TO RESPOND, TOTALLY IGNORE HIM,, HE WILL IN <ent type='ORG'>TIME</ent>, BE FORCED FOR ECONOMIC
SURVIVAL TO TURN TO THE <ent type='ORG'>RUSSIANS</ent>.</p>

<p>I <ent type='PERSON'>AWAIT</ent> YOUR PERSONAL INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING THE PRESENTATION OF A FULL AND
DETAILED BRIEFING OF <ent type='ORG'>THE KHUN</ent> SA <ent type='GPE'>MEET</ent>ING.</p>

<p>RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED BY:</p>

<p>TRA<ent type='ORG'>NSC</ent>RIPT OF RECORDED MESSAGE FROM <ent type='ORG'>SAO KHUN</ent> SA, <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent>LAND TO GEORGE <ent type='PERSON'>BUSH</ent>, VICE
PRESIDENT, <ent type='GPE'>UNITED STATES</ent> OF <ent type='GPE'>AMERICA</ent>. DATED: 08-12-1986 IN THE VILLAGE OF
HO-MONG, <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> TERRITORY, <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent>. TO THE HONORABLE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OF <ent type='GPE'>AMERICA</ent>, MR. <ent type='PERSON'>BUSH</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>SINCE</ent> MR. <ent type='ORG'>SUCHESK</ent> CAME TO OUR PLACE TO <ent type='GPE'>MEET</ent> ME IN THE VILLAGE OF HO-MONG, WE
DISCUSSED THE SITUATION IN <ent type='GPE'>CHINA</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent> AND <ent type='GPE'>THAILAND</ent> AND ABOUT THE D.E.A. AND
<ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> AND ALSO THE <ent type='GPE'>AMERICA</ent>N P.0.W. IN <ent type='LOC'>LAOS</ent>.</p>

<p>THEREFORE I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE LIBERTY TO EXPRESS MY INTENTIONS AND IN
VIEW OF YOUR SITUATION TO YOUR <ent type='ORG'>EXCELLENCY</ent> VICE PRESIDENT OF <ent type='GPE'>THE UNITED STATES</ent>
OF <ent type='GPE'>AMERICA</ent>, I BELIEVE YOUR <ent type='ORG'>EXCELLENCY</ent> IS AN HONORABLE MAN.</p>

<p>WHEN MR. <ent type='PERSON'>JOSEPH NELLIS</ent> ( U.S. <ent type='ORG'>CONGRESS</ent> ) CAME TO <ent type='GPE'>MEET</ent> ME.IN 1977, I PROPOSED A
GUARANTEED SIX YEAR PLAN TO END THE <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> PRODUCTION IN <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> STATE. I KNOW
THAT <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> IS HARMFUL TO SO MANY PEOPLE. I WANT TO HELP SOLVE THIS <ent type='ORG'>PROBLEM</ent>. I
TELL THEM (<ent type='PERSON'>JOE NELLIS</ent> ) THAT THE <ent type='ORG'>MET</ent>HODS THE <ent type='GPE'>AMERICA</ent>NS HAVE BEEN PURSUING SO
FAR WAS AN INEFFECTIVE PRUNING <ent type='ORG'>MET</ent>HOD. TO CUT OFF LEAVES OF SOME ISOLATED
BRANCHES, BUT THE <ent type='ORG'>TREE</ent> NEVER DIES!</p>

<p>MY SIX YEAR PLAN IN CONTRAST WAS THE UPROOTING <ent type='ORG'>MET</ent>HOD, A SURE WAY TO END THE
<ent type='ORG'>PROBLEM</ent>. SO IF D.E.A. REALLY WANT TO END IT, THEY SHOULD HAVE APPROACHED US,
INSTEAD THEY SENT OUR OWN BROTHERS THE THAI MILITARY UNITS TO HUNT ME DOWN,
ALL TOGETHER FOR 36 <ent type='ORG'>TIME</ent>S! IF THEY AIM TO GO ON DOING THE JOB THIS WAY, WE CAN
BET THEY CAN GO ON FOR ANOTHER 60 YEARS AND NEVER SUCCEED. I HAVE SHOWN A
DR<ent type='ORG'>AFT</ent> OF MY PLAN TO MR. NELLIS AND A<ent type='ORG'>GAIN</ent> SEND IT TO YOU THROUGH MR. <ent type='ORG'>SUCHESK</ent>.</p>

<p>NOW PLEASE LET ME PRESENT A SHORT ACCOUNT OF HOW THE <ent type='PERSON'>REBELLION</ent> AND THE <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>PROBLEM</ent> IN <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent> HAVE DEVELOPED TO THIS DATE. <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> STATE HAS BEEN A
PROTECTORATE STATE UNDER <ent type='NORP'>BRITISH</ent> RULE BEFORE 1948. <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> PEOPLE MADE AN
AGREE<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>T TO TAKE INDEPENDENCE WITH THE BURMESE ON A CONDITION THAT <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> STATE
COULD SUCCEED FROM <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent> AS AN INDEPENDENT STATE <ent type='ORG'>AFT</ent>ER 10 YEARS. THAT WAS
WRITTEN IN THE 1948 <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent> CONSTITUTION, WHICH GENERAL NE WIN HAD <ent type='ORG'>ABOLISHED</ent>.
<ent type='ORG'>SINCE</ent> THEN THE <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>REBELLION</ent> BEGAN.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>AFT</ent>ER THE INDEPENDENCE OF <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>THE COMMUNIST PARTY</ent> OF <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent> ALSO MADE
NORTHERN <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> STATE ITS STRONGHOLD, AND THE <ent type='ORG'>KMT</ent> REMNANTS CAME IN FROM <ent type='GPE'>CHINA</ent> IN
EARLY 1950. BEING OPPRESSED BY NE WIN REGIME, <ent type='ORG'>THE COMMUNIST PARTY</ent> OF <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent> AND
THE <ent type='ORG'>KMT</ent> REMNANTS, <ent type='ORG'>THE PEOPLE</ent> OF <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> STATE WERE ON THE VERGE OF STARVATION SO
THEY TURNED TO <ent type='PERSON'>OPIUM CULTIVATION</ent> WHICH THE <ent type='ORG'>KMT</ent> ENCOURAGED THEM TO DO</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>SINCE</ent> THEN, <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> HAS BEEN AN EVER GROWING <ent type='ORG'>PROBLEM</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>THE PEOPLE</ent> GROW.IT NEVER
KNOW WHERE THEIR OPI0M IS HEADING FOR. THEY JUST SELL TO WHOM EVER BUY IT AND
WITH THAT MONEYS THEY WILL BUY OTHER LIFE NECESSITIES.</p>

<p>AS I HAVE SAID THE D.E.A. HAS TRIED SO MANY <ent type='ORG'>TIME</ent>S TO HUNT ME DOWN, DROVE ME
OUT OF <ent type='GPE'>THAILAND</ent> AND SAID WITHIN <ent type='GPE'>THREE</ent> MONTHS KHUN SA WOULD BE <ent type='ORG'>DEA</ent>D, OR HE
WOULD FLEE TO <ent type='ORG'>RANGOON</ent>, OR GO JOIN <ent type='ORG'>THE COMMUNIST PARTY</ent> OF <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent>. IN REALITY FOR
KHUN SA, THERE IS NO NEED TO RUN AWAY TO ANY OTHER PLACE. HE HAS HIS NATIVE
LAND <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> STATE. <ent type='ORG'>SINCE</ent> HE IS WORKING FOR HIS PEOPLE THEY SUPPORT HIM WITH WHAT
THEY HAVE, RICE, CORN, <ent type='ORG'>SALT</ent>, CLOTHES, MONEY AND IF THEY ONLY HAVE <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent>, THEY
GIVE HIM <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent>.</p>

<p>CONCERNING THE <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> <ent type='ORG'>PROBLEM</ent>, DON'T THINK THAT THE <ent type='GPE'>BURMA</ent>, THAI AND D.E.A.
REALLY WANT TO FIND THE REAL SOLUTION. .THE RESULTS OF THEIR WORK MAY BE THE
BEST PROOF, AND STILL THE U.S. GOVERN<ent type='ORG'>MEN</ent>T SUPPORTS THEM, AND WILL NOT EVEN
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MY SIX YEAR PLAN, MY GUARANTEE, INSTEAD THEY SUPPORT THOSE
WHO ARE KILLING OUR PEOPLE.</p>

<p>HATE FOR THE U.S.A. IS GROWING IN THE HEARTS OF OUR PEOPLE. THEY SAY THE
U.S.A. IS KILLING OUR PARENTS FOR THE SAKE OF OUR CHILDREN, AND KILLING OUR
CHILDREN FOR THE SAKE OF OUR PARENTS. WE ARE NOT SELLING OUR <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> TO THEM,
THEY CAN STAY AWAY FROM BUYING, WHY ALL THIS KILLING?</p>

<p>THEY USE HERBICIDES TO SPRAY ON OUR FARMS THAT KILLS NOT ONLY <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> PLANTS BUT
ALSO OTHER VEGETABLES, INCLUDING GRASS AND LIVESTOCK. IT ALSO POISONS WATER
AROUND THE AREAS WHICH CLAIMS A THR<ent type='ORG'>EAT</ent> TO HUMAN LIVES. IS THAT THE POLICY OF
HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE U.S.A. DO THEY THINK THAT OUR LIVES ARE NOT AS VALUABLE AS
THE<ent type='ORG'>IRS</ent>? FOR MY PART I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT IF THE U.S.A. WANTS TO STOP US
FROM GROWING <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent>, THEY SHOULD STOP GROWING WH<ent type='ORG'>EAT</ent>, WHERE THEN ARE THEY GOING
TO GET THEIR BREAD?. ( MONEY ) FORGIVE ME FOR SAYING THIS SIR, I'M NOT MEANING
TO BE RUDE, I ONLY WANT YOU TO BE SYMPATHETIC.</p>

<p>OUR COUNTRY IS SURROUNDED BY <ent type='GPE'>CHINA</ent>, <ent type='LOC'>LAOS</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>THAILAND</ent> AND THE LOW LANDS OF BURMZ.
A<ent type='ORG'>GAIN</ent> THEY ( <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent> <ent type='ORG'>DEA</ent>LERS) COME FROM <ent type='GPE'>THAILAND</ent>, FROM <ent type='GPE'>CHINA</ent>. WHEN EVER THE
THAI'S DO SO<ent type='ORG'>MET</ent>HING BAD TO OUR PEOPLE, THEY SAY THAT IT IS D.E.A., AND D.E.A.
IS <ent type='GPE'>AMERICA</ent>NS! IN THIS WAY THE HATE TOWARDS <ent type='GPE'>AMERICA</ent>N PEOPLE GROWS.</p>

<p>YOUR <ent type='ORG'>EXCELLENCY</ent>, I AM <ent type='ORG'>SINCE</ent>RE IN SAYING THAT I WANT TO HELP SOLVE THIS
<ent type='ORG'>PROBLEM</ent>. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, SEND ANOTHER GROUP TO ME TO COMPETE A<ent type='ORG'>GAIN</ent>ST
THE D.E.A. TO WORK TOWARDS THE SOLUTION. THE RESULTS WILL SOON BE SEEN.
WHOEVER CAN SOLVE THE NARCOTIC <ent type='ORG'>PROBLEM</ent> IN THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE WILL BE ONE OF
THE GR<ent type='ORG'>EAT</ent> HEROES IN THE WORLD, AND I WISH TO HELP HIM.</p>

<p>I BELIEVE THAT EVERY LEADER OF HIS NATION IS WORKING FOR THE WELFARE OF HIS
PEOPLE, AND THE WELFARE OF ALL <ent type='ORG'>MANKIND</ent>. I BELIEVE THAT YOUR <ent type='ORG'>EXCELLENCY</ent> WOULD
BE INTERESTED IN SERVING ALL <ent type='ORG'>MANKIND</ent>. IF WE ARE ABLE TO FREE OUR <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> STATE
TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT STATE, WITH THE HELP OF YOUR <ent type='ORG'>EXCELLENCY</ent>, WE WOULD
EVEN BE PLEASED TO BECOME ONE OF THE STATES OF THE U.S.A. AND A BASE TO
<ent type='EVENT'>PREVENT</ent> THE SPREADING OF COMMUNISM.</p>

<p>I HOPE THE VISIT OF MR. <ent type='ORG'>SUCHESK</ent> AND MR. <ent type='ORG'>DICK HSU</ent> WILL BECOME A STEPPING STONE
TO OUR CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WHICH WILL LEAD TO THE SALVATION OF VICTIMS OF THE
WORLD.</p>

<p>I BEG YOUR EXZELLENCY TO HELP <ent type='ORG'>THE PEOPLE</ent> OF <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> STATE. <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> STATE IS A VZRY
BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY RICH IN MINERALS AND <ent type='ORG'>FORESTS</ent> AND FREE FROM ALL KINDS OF
NATURAL D<ent type='ORG'>ISA</ent>STERS. IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO WOULD WISH TO HELP US, WE BELIEVE WE
COULD PAY YOU BACK WITH OUR NATURAL RESOURCES.</p>

<p>IF <ent type='ORG'>SHAN</ent> STATE BECOMES AN INDEPENDENT STATE I AM CERTAIN IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE
PROGRESSIVE THAN <ent type='GPE'>SINGAPORE</ent> AND IT CAN BECOME A PLACE WHERE UNIVERSITIES CAN BE
ESTABLISHED AND PEOPLE FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD WOULD WANT TO <ent type='ORG'>ATTEND</ent>,
BECAUSE IT IS A <ent type='ORG'>CALM</ent> AND BEAUTIFUL PLACE WITH MODERATE CLIMATE AND FREE FROM
NATURAL D<ent type='ORG'>ISA</ent>STERS.</p>

<p>AS A F<ent type='ORG'>IRS</ent>T STEP TO FIND WAYS OF EARNING MONEYS TO SUBSTITUTE THE <ent type='ORG'>OPIUM</ent>
CULTIVATION, WE WOULD LIKE TO MANUFACTURE SOUVENIR COINS AND STAMPS IN GOLD
AND SILVER, AS MR. <ent type='ORG'>SUCHESK</ent> HAS SUGZESTED. BUT WE HAVE VERY LITTLE EDUCATED
PEOPLE TO HANDLE THIS, SO I BEG YOUR <ent type='ORG'>EXCELLENCY</ent> TO ALLOW MR. <ent type='ORG'>SUCHESK</ent> AND MR.
<ent type='ORG'>DICK HSU</ent> TO COME AND HELP US IN THIS FIELD.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>THE SILENT</ent> WAR</p>

<p> We are engaged in a silent war. Those waging this brutal conflict have

<p>Re: <ent type='ORG'>Citizen Complaint</ent> of Wrongdoing by <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> Officers</p>

<p>Dear Mr. <ent type='PERSON'>Meese</ent>:</p>

<p>I am writing to you to register my complaints about certain actions that have
been carried out against me and my associates. I believe these actions
constitute violations of our civil rights as well as violations of the
criminal law in some instances. These actions are all the more reprehensible
in that they are politically motivated. I take this means to request that you
investigate these matters and, where appropriate, reprimand the individuals
involved and file criminal charges.</p>

<p>Let me explain my situation to you. I am a veteran of <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent>.
I served with the Special Forces in the <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> War for more than two years
between 1964 and 1970. I consider myself to be a patriot and am proud of my
service to this country. Since the end of the <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> War, I have been
actively involved in seeking to locate and free <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> POW's and MIA's left
behind in Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>. I have been associated in these activities with Lt.
Col. James "Bo" <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> and others, including <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent></ent>. I believe our
efforts have been carried out with the tacit ) if not always, overt ) approval
of certain elements within our government. These government and military
officials share our goal of freeing these forgotten <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1986 Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> and Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent> went to <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent>. They had
received intelligence from the "Basement of the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>", which led them
to believe certain <ent type='NORP'>Burmese</ent> had information about <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> POW's. These leads
proved to be unfounded. However, on that trip Col <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> learned about illegal
furg trafficking directed by U.S. government)related operatives. These drup
dealing activities were on such a scale that they were used to fund covert,
para)military operations in Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent> and in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>In May of 1987 I went to <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> with Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> and others. We brought back
startling evidence directly linking <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> officials with illegal drug
trafficking. A report on this <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> trip is attached he<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>o as Exhibit "A."</p>

<p>Over the years it has baffled me why the U.S. Government would not actively
and vigorously pursue the release of our POW's and MIA's. Now, the answer is
clear. Any renewed <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> activity in Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>, on a scale necessary
to the release of the abandoned POW's and MIA's, would attract unwanted
attention to covert activities in the are. Government)sponsored drug
trafficking is an explosive subject. Obviously, many government elements want
the story left untold.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent></ent> was charged with illegal transportation of explosives. He was
made promises by <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Thomas Hahn</ent> which induced him to plead guilty to
the charges. It is, of course, highly improper for law enforcement officials
to make promises, especially false promises, to criminal defendants to
persuade them to plead to criminal charges. This was done in Mr. Weekly's
case. Pages were extracted from his pre)sentence report which would, very
likely have mitigated his sentence. This action would have to have been known
about and approved by the Assistant U.S. Attorney <ent type='PERSON'>Stephen Korotash</ent>. In
<ent type='GPE'>Montana</ent>, Mr. Korotash's activities would have violated <ent type='ORG'>the Canons</ent> of
Professional Ethics, which hold:</p>

<p>""a public prosecutor or other government lawyer in criminal litigation shall
make timely disclosure to counsel for the defendant, or to the defendant if he
has no counsel, of the existence of evidence, known to the prosecutor or other
government lawyer, that tends to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigate the
degree of the offense, or reduce the punishment." DR 7*103(b)^E^</p>

<p>""A lawyer shall not suppress any evidence that he or his client has a legal
obligation to reveal or produce." DR 7)109(A)^E^</p>

<p>I believe Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> and Attorney <ent type='PERSON'>Korotash</ent> conspired to violate \Mr. Weekly's
rights by persuading him not to <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ain effective counsel and to plead guilty.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> was charged with a passport violation and has
registered his own complaint, a copy of which is attached he<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>o as Exhibit
"B." Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> recently informed me that U.S. government representatives
offered him government employment and dismissal of the charges against him if
he would cease activities relative to the POW's and stay out of Southeast
<ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>. In other words, if Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> would shut up and cease his activities in
Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent> everything would be all right ) for him. As usual no thought
was given to the POW's and MIA's nor their families and loved ones.</p>

<p>Following my <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urn from <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> on June 1, 1987, Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> was charged. I set
out to investigate facts relative to the passport violation charge as well as
the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent></ent> situation. During the course of my short investigation there
were several incidents which took place that were certainly blatant violations
of my rights as a U.S. citizen. Itt is my opinion that the reason these
violations took place is because I had in my possession\j\reports, documents
and tapes which accuse and support accusations that U.S. Government officials
deal in drugs and certain government employees have lied and obstructed
justice in order to convict perfectly innocent persons of criminal
wrongdoings.</p>

<p>I believe they have been motivated by a desire to silence myself and my
associates to keep the lid on the drug trafficking evidence we have uncovered.
Short of that, they seek to discredit us and the information we've obtained.</p>

<p>I traveled to <ent type='GPE'>Seattle</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, on June 27, 1987, to interview a U.S.
Customs Agent named <ent type='PERSON'>James Foley</ent>. Mr. Foley's telephone number is (206)
442)1974. His address is 1580 South 156th Street, <ent type='GPE'>Seattle</ent>.</p>

<p>I spoke with Inspector <ent type='PERSON'>Foley</ent> and told him I needed to locate the customs agent
who passed Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> used, which was stamped at SEA)TAC Airport by Agent
1099. Attached he<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>o as Exhibit "C" is a copy of the passport. I told him
that Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> had had several passports with him and the agent had taken him
to an interrogation room. There he told Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> he hoped he had a
telephone number they could call. Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> gave them a number and one of
the customs men left. <ent type='ORG'>Ret</ent>urning a few minutes later, he said "Okay Col.
<ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent>, you're free to go". Inspector <ent type='PERSON'>Foley</ent> told me he may know hwo the
customs agent was that finally cleared Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> through. He said that the
number stamped in the passport may or may not mean anything but he may
possibly recognize the handwriting.</p>

<p>The next day, June 27th, I contacted Inspector <ent type='PERSON'>Foley</ent> at his home. He told me
he had spoken with another Inspector named <ent type='PERSON'>Arthur Henning</ent>. He said he had
asked <ent type='PERSON'>Henning</ent> if he could <ent type='PERSON'>remmeber</ent> an incident about five years ago when a
Green Be<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Colonel came through customs with several passports. Inspector
<ent type='PERSON'>Foley</ent> told me Inspector <ent type='PERSON'>Henning</ent> immediately told him, "James 'Bo' <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent>."
<ent type='PERSON'>Henning</ent> said he remembered the incident because of the publicity Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent>
received on the POW issue shortly thereafter. <ent type='PERSON'>Henning</ent> said he had taken Col.
<ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> to an interview room along with another customs agent, <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Hood</ent></ent>. Col.
<ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> had given them a telephone number whihc <ent type='PERSON'>Henning</ent> said was to the State
Department. <ent type='PERSON'>Henning</ent> told <ent type='PERSON'>Foley</ent> he handled the incident. He said Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Hood</ent>
may have written down the telephone number <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> had given them a telephone
number which <ent type='PERSON'>Henning</ent> said was to the State Department. <ent type='PERSON'>Henning</ent> told <ent type='PERSON'>Foley</ent> he
handled the incident. He said Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Hood</ent> may have written down the telephone
number <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> gave them in his notes and could still possibly have it. He told
<ent type='PERSON'>Foley</ent> the call to the State Department would have been made by a supervisor,
possibly <ent type='PERSON'>Lynne Robson</ent>, who is now dead. <ent type='PERSON'>Henning</ent> told <ent type='PERSON'>Foley</ent> he remembered Col.
<ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> was carrying at least three passports. He, also, said there would be a
"<ent type='ORG'>Negative Search Report</ent>" on the incident. I sought this information because
we had been led by U.S. Attorney <ent type='PERSON'>Wulfson</ent> that this type evidence should have
been sufficient to result in the dismissal of the charges against Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent>
regarding the fraudulent passport. After receiving this\j\information from
me, Col. Gritz's attorney, <ent type='PERSON'>Lamond Mills</ent>, contacted <ent type='PERSON'>Wulfson</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Wulfson</ent> told
Mills he had already talked to Customs Inspector <ent type='PERSON'>Henning</ent> about the incident,
but that he wasn't dropping any charges, despite what he had said earlier.</p>

<p>About that same time I was contacted by an investigative reporter named Tony
<ent type='ORG'>Kimerey</ent> from <ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent> City, <ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Kimerey</ent> told me he was in the office of
the Assistant U.S. Attorney, <ent type='PERSON'>Stephen Korotash</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Jerry Bohnen</ent>, a <ent type='ORG'>KTOK</ent> news
reporter, was there too. <ent type='ORG'>Kimerey</ent> can be reached at telephone number (404)
525)6780. <ent type='PERSON'>Jerry Bohnen</ent> can be reached at (405) 840)1948. Also present in the
office was Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms Agent Tom <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Kimerey</ent> said that <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent>
Agent Tom <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> told him, in the presence of <ent type='PERSON'>Korotash</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Bohnen</ent>, that he
(<ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent>) had removed 9 pages from the documents that went before <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> Judge
<ent type='PERSON'>Alley</ent>, before the sentencing of <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent></ent>. The pages that <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> removed
were letters from several different Government agencies corroborating the
story that <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent></ent> was involved in the <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent> traiing program which was
sanctioned by the U.S. Government. If it were so, that the program was
sanctioned by the government, then no laws would have been broken in shipping
the C)4 by commercial air carrier. <ent type='ORG'>Kimerey</ent> also said that a U.S. Government
investigator, who has done investigations for the U.S. Attorney's Office in
<ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent> City, told him he could not understand why <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> and U.S.
Attorney <ent type='PERSON'>Korotash</ent> were being so malicious in prosecuting and railroading <ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent>.</p>

<p>On July 18th, I traveled to <ent type='GPE'>Vancouver</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Columbia</ent> to find a man named
<ent type='PERSON'>Ahmad Rashid</ent> and his wife, Marga<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Ahmad</ent> was <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent></ent> and Col. Gritz's
government contact in the <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent> training program. A meeting with <ent type='PERSON'>Ahmad</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent></ent> and Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> was set up in August 1986 by <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bode</ent></ent>, then
Special Assistant to the Under Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ary of State for Security Assistance.
Assistant U.S. Attorney <ent type='PERSON'>Korotash</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> have been saying all along
that there was no <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent> traiing. They claim <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent> and Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> were
selling explosives ot the <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>ians. This is utterly ridiculous. I had
thought at one time that maybe they really didn't know about the <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent>
training. Maybe they were being lied to by persons in the government. But
now I find that Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> has been in contact with <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bode</ent></ent> since the
early days, even before <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent> was arrested in December of 1986. <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> was
given a training schedule of the <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent> training by <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bode</ent></ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Bode</ent>
admitted this to Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent>.</p>

<p>Upon my arrival in <ent type='GPE'>Vancouver</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Columbia</ent>, I contacted Marga<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Rashid,
wife of <ent type='PERSON'>Ahmad</ent>. Marga<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> had assisted her husband in the briefing of Col.
<ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> and <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent></ent>. Marga<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Ahmad</ent> were to have given <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> and
<ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent> all of their knowledge on the <ent type='PERSON'>Mujahadeen</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent> Freedom Fighters so
that they could use this knowledge in training several different factions of
<ent type='PERSON'>Mujahadeen</ent> in hopes of unifying them. I was lucky to have reached Marga<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>
when I did because she was getting ready to leave <ent type='GPE'>Vancouver</ent> within a few days
to join her husband <ent type='GPE'>in\j\Montreal</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Ahmad</ent> was in <ent type='GPE'>Montreal</ent> looking for a place
for them to live.</p>

<p>Marga<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> and I talked about her role in giving the information to <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent> and
<ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> about the <ent type='PERSON'>Mujahadeen</ent> in August of 1986. Marga<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> told me that she and
<ent type='PERSON'>Ahmad</ent> were in constant contact with <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bode</ent></ent>. She said that <ent type='PERSON'>Bode</ent> was
their U.S. Government contact. As a matter of fact <ent type='PERSON'>Bode</ent> was the one that gave
her and <ent type='PERSON'>Ahmad</ent> the money to move to <ent type='GPE'>Montreal</ent>. This evidence would provce that
this was a government)sponsored program. That being the case, <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent> should
not have been convicted of the crime he was charged with. <ent type='PERSON'>Bode</ent> and his
associates were trying to get the <ent type='ORG'>Rashids</ent> out of <ent type='GPE'>Vancouver</ent> before Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent>
or anyone tried to contact them. Marga<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> said she also knew of <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> and
Weekly's problem. She knew <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent> was in jail but she did not exactly know
why. She said she had a three way telephone conversation with <ent type='PERSON'>Bode</ent> and
another man from the U.S. Government some time ago. The man from the U.S.
Government was the one who suggested they move to <ent type='GPE'>Montreal</ent> away from
<ent type='GPE'>Vancouver</ent>. He was also the one who suggested that <ent type='PERSON'>Bode</ent> give them the money to
move on so that we could not find them. Marga<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> could not remember the name
of the U.S. Government official they had the conversation with, but I found
out later it was <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> Agent Tom <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bode</ent></ent> had called Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> about the same time I was visiting
MArga<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>. He had no idea I had been talking to her. He told Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> he
had just heard of Weekly's being in jail. He told Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> he was no longer
working in <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent> studies or in the State Department. He told <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> that he
hadn't been there since last February. He said that if someone had contacted
him before he would have at least given <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> a copy of the <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent> training
schedule to prove <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent> was working under the auspices of <ent type='ORG'>the Government</ent>.</p>

<p>A few days later, when <ent type='PERSON'>Bode</ent> had found out I had talked to Marga<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Rashid, he
again called Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent>. He asked Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> who <ent type='PERSON'>Lance Trimmer</ent> was. He told
Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> he had tried helping all he could. He said he had given Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent>
a copy of the training schedule. In the prior converstaion he had said he may
have given him a copy. He also stated then that <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> was the third
person on the three way telephone conversation with him and the <ent type='ORG'>Rashids</ent>.</p>

<p>The above information are all lies told by Government employees <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent>
and Assistant U.S. Attorney <ent type='PERSON'>Korotash</ent> have lied from the beginning and they
continue to lie. My attorney in <ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent> City, <ent type='PERSON'>Frank Miskovski</ent>, who is a very
prominent attorney in that area, told me that he has not once talked to <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent>
Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> that <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> had not lied to him.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> admitted to two reporters that he omitted several pages of documents to
be presented to a U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> Judge in recommending a long jail term for
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent></ent>. This was a clear violation of Weekly's rights. <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> was
instrumental in trying to hide\j\witnesses that could prove <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent></ent>'s
innocence. Those witnesses could have proven that <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent> was involved in a
legitimate, U.S. Governemnt)approved, training program of <ent type='PERSON'>Mujahadeen</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent>
Freedom Fighters. It seems very clear to me that Assistant U.S. Attorney
<ent type='PERSON'>Korotash</ent> was also involved in the hiding of these documents.</p>

<p>I have continuously tried to determine why <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> and U.S. Attorney
<ent type='PERSON'>Korotash</ent> would want so badly to put Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> and <ent type='ORG'><ent type='PERSON'>Scott</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent></ent> in jail. The
only conclusion that I have is that some persons or people higher up in the
Government are pressuring them to muzzle Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent>. Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> is a proven
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> hero, whose only goal in life is to bring home <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Prisoners of
War left behind in Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent> after the <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> War. The government wants
to stop him from giving to the <ent type='PERSON'>Americna</ent> people documents and evidence that
show U.S. Government officials are now, and have been, dealing in drugs.</p>

<p>These are acts of governmental agents involving the obstruction of justice and
illegal suppression of evidence, which would show the charges against both
<ent type='ORG'>Weekly</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> to be ill)founded.</p>

<p>Now, let me address the acts which have carried out against me.</p>

<p>I was arrested at the U.S./Canadian Point of Entry, <ent type='GPE'>Blaine</ent>, Washinton, on
August 13, 1987, by U.S. Customs officials. I was arrested on a warrant,
issued out of the federal district court of <ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent> City, <ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent>. There
were no charges. I was wanted as a material witness to testify before the
grand jury in <ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent>.</p>

<p>Immediately following my arrest, I was searched and placed in a holding cell.
I was told by a Customs Agent that they were going to look in my car. Much
later, three agents came to my cell. One of them, who appeared to be in
charge, introduced himself as <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Williams</ent>. He read me my rights and asked me
a couple of questions. I would not answer his questions but told him I was
sure he had read a report that was in my bag that would answer all the
questions he had. He insinuated that what he had read was interesting. One
of the agents with him asked me if I had a number that he could call. What he
meant was, he wanted to know if I was working for some government agency. I
told him I had none. I don't believe he would have asked that had he not read
papers in my briefcase. I was then chained up with leg irons, belts and
handcuffs and taken to <ent type='GPE'>Whatcom County Jail</ent> where I was booked in,
finger)printed and mugged. I was told that <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> Agents would pick me up in the
morning and take me before a magistrate in <ent type='GPE'>Seattle</ent>.</p>

<p>The next day two <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> Agents, <ent type='PERSON'>Norm Prins</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Jane Heffner</ent>, picked me up for
transfer to the <ent type='GPE'>Seattle</ent> U.S. Marshall's Office. Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Prins</ent> handcuffed me
with my hands behind my back, put me in leg irons and escorted me to his
vehicle for the 1 1/2 hour drive to <ent type='GPE'>Seattle</ent>. He told me he had two of my bags
in their trunk. He also said that he had been to the Canadian Border where
they had picked up my bags from Customs. I asked where the other two were and
was told he knew nothing about them. Obviously, they had searched my car and
seized and searched my personal property.</p>

<p>On the way in Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Prins</ent> said he'd like me to answer some personal questions
he had. He said they had nothing to do with my case because he knew nothing
about it. He said his questions had to do with POW's. If he knew nothing
about my case, he would not have known to ask me about POW's. I assume he had
read the papers in my briefcase and clothes bag. We talked about POW's and
also about my <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> Report.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the U.S. Marshall's Office, where I had to appear before
the <ent type='ORG'>Magistrate</ent>, my hands and arms were asleep from having to sit handcuffed
with my arms behind my back. The marks and bruises were still on my hands
from the cuffs four days later. Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Prins</ent> got my two bags out of the trunk
of his car. I noticed the center section of my clothes bag was still zipped
open. I never was allowed to look in my bags. They said they had brought
them to turn over to the U.S. Marshall's Office, but <ent type='ORG'>the Marshall</ent>'s Office
refused to accept them. They obviously argued over them for some time until
the <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> agents said they would take them and hold them in their office. I
asked again about my briefcase and clothes bag but was told that Customs had
kept them. I asked why and was told that they were "doing something" with
them. I asked what, and was told just "something, but I shouldn't worry about
it." I said abviously they are making copies of my diary and reports. They
said they didn't know but admitted it was possible.</p>

<p>Before appearing before the <ent type='ORG'>Magistrate</ent> one of the U.S. <ent type='PERSON'>Marshall</ent>s called the
Customs Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Williams</ent> and asked about my briefcase and camera case. I could
not hear what Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Williams</ent> was saying but when he hung up <ent type='ORG'>the Marshall</ent> told
me that <ent type='PERSON'>Williams</ent> would have my bags sent to whatever address I wanted. I told
him I wanted my bags brought to me because they also contained my credit cards
and identification which the agents had kept when they took my wallet, also I
told them they had no reason to keep them. The <ent type='PERSON'>Marshall</ent> then told me they
were "doing something with them." When I asked "what," he said he had no idea.</p>

<p>I was then taken to the <ent type='ORG'>Magistrate</ent> where I was admitted to a $10000 bail. I
told them I could make bail immediately if I could make a phone call. This
was approximately 4:30 p.m. The <ent type='PERSON'>Marshall</ent>s then took me from the courtroom
back up the elevator to their office. When we passed a phone I asked if I
could make that call. They said I could when I got to the office. When we
reached the office, they had me go into their little holding room and then
fooled around preparing this and that. I asked again about a call and was
told, "in a minute." It was obvious they were stalling for time since it was
close to 5:00 p.m. When I was finally allowed to call it was too late for
anything to be done. This meant I was stuck in jail for the weekend.\j\</p>

<p>I was then allowed to call <ent type='ORG'>Custons</ent> Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Williams</ent>. I asked him about my
briefcase and camera bag. He said he would send them somewhere for me. I
told him I had to have them in my hands. I needed my identification and
credit cards to bail out of jail. He said there was no way to get them to me
now that the weekend was there. I told him someone could surely drop them at
the <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> Office with my other bags. He said they couldn't do that until
Monday. I asked if it was going to take that long to make copies of my
personal diary and papers. He said they weren't doing that. I said what
about the phone numbers. He said we are just "doing something" with the bag.
I said I would like them right away. He said it was impossible and I would
get them on Monday or maybe Tuesday. They would be through with them then.
He stated he would not be there</p>

<p>personally himself next week but someone else would handle it. That was the
best he could do. I was then taken to <ent type='GPE'>Kent</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, to the <ent type='GPE'>Kent</ent>
Corrections Center. I was taken there in handcuffs and chains. I was
fingerprinted and mugged for the third time.</p>

<p>While in the <ent type='GPE'>Kent</ent> Corrections Center I made four written requests. The first
one was made on August 15. I requested they <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urn my briefcase and personal
belongings being held by Customs immediately. This included my credit cards
and other identification. I was told they could do nothing. They said I must
contact the agency that had them, although those agencies wouldn't accept a
collect call. I wrote another request on August 16 and was told the same
thing. Copies of all four requests are attached as Exhibit "D." On August 17
they would not answer my request and on August 18 I was not allowed to make a
phone call. They did finally tell me that a U.S. <ent type='PERSON'>Marshall</ent> had brought my
identification cards from Customs on that day after I had told them I would
not leave the jail without my identification even if I was bailed out, because
it was clear they could arrest me for vagrancy.</p>

<p>While in the jail there were two phone calls I made which were very important
regarding my bail. On one occasion, I was right at the point of learning a
phone number that I needed to call to have bail brought immediately, when the
conversation was cut off by whoever was monitoring the call. Several persons
called the jail with messages for me, with regard to bailing me out, but the
messages were never given to me. Finally on Tuesday afternoon, August 18, I
was allowed to bail out on a $10000 cash bond. The attorney who was
instrumental in bailing me out had to drive me to the Canadian Border at
<ent type='GPE'>Blaine</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, which was more than 125 miles away in order for me to get
my briefcase and camera bag.</p>

<p>All of the contents in those bags obviously had been removed. My notes and
papers were thrown back in completely out of order and it looked as though
several typewritten notes were missing. The Customs Agent, <ent type='PERSON'>Joe Rydell</ent>, stated
that I either had to sign an inventory list they had made up or he would not
<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urn my belongings. There was no way I could tell if every piece of paper
was there. I was never given an inventory list of what they took from me.
They kept my personal diary, papers, pictures, and identifications cards,
including credit cards, for six days and refused to <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urn them. They told me
they were "doing something" with them. It was clearly an illegal search and
seizure. I was only arrested as a material witness. I have been a law
enforcement officer and understand what the term "probable cause" means.
There was no probable cause to seize my property and search it. There was no
reason to treat me like a criminal. I can understand being jailed on a
warrant. I cannot understand being handcuffed, chained, mugged and
fingerprinted on numerous occasions, being denied access to my property, and
being denied the opportunity to arrange bail. All of this was a serious
violation of my civil rights.</p>

<p>After I finally got released on bail I had to travel more that 200 miles to
<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>rieve my personal belongings. They forced me to personally go out of the
way which took another day. It was then too late to travel to my home in
<ent type='GPE'>Montana</ent>. I had to go to <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> to secure my automobile and then travel to
<ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent> City where I was to appear before a Grand Jury on the <ent type='ORG'>Subpoena</ent> the
government had issued me upon my arrival. I called the U.S. Attorney's
Office and checked in as I was supposed to do. The man that I talked to about
transportation to <ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent> City told me that I should pay my own way and turn
in a voucher on the day I appeared before the Grand Jury. I then left for
<ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent> City. I needed to find a lawyer for my appearance.</p>

<p>When I appeared at the U.S. Attorney's Office with my attorney, Frank
Miskovski in <ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent> City, we were met by <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> Agent Tom <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent>. Tom <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent>
stated that U.S. Attorney <ent type='PERSON'>Korotash</ent> was out of town. I asked if he was also on
vacation and <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> replied he didn't know. He told me <ent type='PERSON'>Korotash</ent> was out of town
and could not be reached. <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> said he had been trying to contact me for the
past ten days. I called him a liar. He said he was not lying. I told him I
called in twice to the U.S. Attorney's Office. <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> stated that I only called
in once. I told him I called on Monday August 24 and checked in with a woman
sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ary. I also called in on August 26 and told a male I would be coming to
<ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent> City and wanted to know about travel arrangements. <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> said he only
heard of one time I called. He said that he had called my attorney several
times in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>. I called <ent type='PERSON'>Mike Jordan</ent>, my attorney in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, on
August 30 from <ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent> City. He told me that <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> had called him on Friday
trying to contact me to tell me they postponed the Grand Jury Hearing.</p>

<p>On September 1st, the day of my scheduled appearance, <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> gave me a new
subpoena for September 14. I asked if my bail would now be <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urned. He said
he didn't see why not. He would check. I waited for some time before <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urned and told my attorney that they were going to hold my cash bail of
$10000 until I appeared on September 14.</p>

<p>I left to make a phone call and then <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urned with my attorney and asked for
Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent>. I was told he was no longer around. My attorney asked to speak
with the U.S. Attorney Price. He was not around. This was at 11:30 a.m. We
asked to speak with any U.S. Attorney who could make a decision. We were
taken to a Chief U.S. Attorney whom I told I wanted my bail <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urned or to be
put back in jail. I told him the bail I received was promised to be sent back
to the person it came from on September 1 and I had appeared as promised.
This U.S. Attorney called Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> who, just a few minutes earlier, could
not be found, and had <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> come to his office. He told <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> I was there to be
put in jail so my bail would be <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urned. </p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> immediately made many calls. A long time later he came out ant told my
attorney that they would either <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urn my bail and place me in jail, <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urn my
bail and release me on my own recognizance or schedule the hearing in the
morning. He was to call my attorney at his office. Later in the afternoon,
my attorney contacted me about 4:30 p.m. and said that <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> was obviously a
habitual liar. He had finally talked to <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> after 4:00 p.m. and <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> told
him he called 4 or 5 times but couldn't reach him. My attorney's sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ary
said that <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> had called once. My attorney was not in and <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> did not call
back. My attorney called <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> back twice but could not find him. He finally
reached <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> about 4:10 p.m. and <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> told him they reset the Grand Jury
Hearing for the following morning, September 2. I appeared at 9;00 a.m. on
September 2nd before the Grand Jury. I talked about U.S. Officials dealing in
drugs., about General Khun Sa of <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent>, about a statement I made of a
complaint being filed regarding charges oif wrongdoing by <ent type='ORG'>AFT</ent> Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent>.
<ent type='ORG'>Halfway</ent> through the U&gt;S&gt; Attorney's questions, they stopped the hearing and
tol;d me there would be no more questions. It was approximately 11:00 a.m. I
was told that I was free to go and would have to <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urn on Oct. 5. I believe
that is less than coincidental that Col. <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> passport violation case is
scheduled for trial in <ent type='GPE'>Las Vegas</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Nevada</ent>, on the very same date.</p>

<p>My attorney and I asked that my bail be <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urned along with my passport. <ent type='ORG'>AFT</ent>
Agent <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> said he saw no problem with that. He said he would clear it with
U.S. Attorney <ent type='PERSON'>Blair Watson</ent>. We waited about 45 minutes. <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> came later and
said he would have it taken care of after lunch. My Attorney called him after
lunch but, as usual, he was not around then. He talked to the U.S. Attorney
<ent type='PERSON'>Watson</ent> who said he didn't know about the bail and it would have to stay
whereever it was. He believed it was being held in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> State where it

Waashington and was tiold it had been sent to <ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent>. My attorney talked
with the U.S. Attorney in <ent type='GPE'>Seattle</ent> later and was told <ent type='PERSON'>Hahn</ent> had told them that
because it took so long for them to find me he didn't think they should
release my bail. There was never <ent type='PERSON'>andy</ent> agreement to release my bail until
Sept. 14th. At this writing I still don't have it back. Since recovering my
property I have discovered that several items are missing, including typed
notes and a tape\j\of conversations with Marga<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Rashid and <ent type='PERSON'>Tony Kimerey</ent>. I
spent more than ten years of my life serving my country as a soldier. I
risked my life in combat in support of our government. I worked as a court
officer a police officer and as an investigator for a prperiod of 15 years. I
have a college degree in criminal justice. I believe in our system and have
proven my commitment by my service. I cannot tolerate nor abide the
perversion and subvertion of our system, especially by those)like me)who have
taken an oath to defend it.</p>

<p>This complaint deals with high)level government policy makers who have
sacrificed our POW'S and MIA's, and alot more, to cover)up illigal and
reprehensible drug trafficking activies. It deals with federal Justice
Department officials who have lied, silenced witnesses, discredited genuine
patriots and heroes, obstructed justice and used their power to harass and
intimidate honorable citizens. I've heard of the alleged illigal drug
trafficking, supported by the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, in Central <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. Until my recent
experience I wouldn't have believed it. You are the top law enforcement
officer in <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States. You have a duty to investigate, vigorously, the
charges raised in this complaint. Today is the 200 anniversary of our
constitution. The greatest threat to that sacred document is being mounted
today by the lairs, obstructors of justice and other slime who believe the
ends justify the means and "plausible deniability" is a defensible standard of
conduct in an open, democratic system. The people and activites, complained
of herein, threatenour very system of laws. Do yourself proud. Deal with
these complaints vigorously.. The issue of illegal drug trafficking is now
before the publis.</p>

<p>When it becomes apparent to the public that our POW's and MIA's have been
abandoned and our youth have been exposed to drugs to protect such an
activity, the wrath of the people will be incredible. It no longer works to
try to hide this activity, too many know of it. The tactics that have been
used to produce the silence of people like me oon this issue, are
unjustifiable. Restore my faith in my government. Do your duty, as I have
sought to do mine. And as those POW's and MIA's abandoned in Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>,
have done theirs. </p>

<p>DRUG STORY HARD TO BELIEVE</p>

<p>Since the earlier publication of evidence of US government officials
trafficking in drugs in SE asia, evidence has been piling up in the <ent type='ORG'>Digest</ent>
office. There is so much of it, from widely diverse sources ranging from
<ent type='PERSON'>Mother Jones</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>the Christic Institute</ent> on the left, to <ent type='ORG'>Reuters</ent> and US News
and World Report, to first)hand testimony from a warlord of the Golden
Triangle, that it seems that there must be a real fire somewhere under all
this smoke. Since the evidence is massive and the trail of the players
twisted, let us attempt to summarize. Opium and heroin have been imported
into the US from SE <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent> in huge quantities by US and allied government
officials since the 1940s.</p>

<p>This activity became especially heavy from the 1960s forward. A great deal of
the money generated by this drug trade, particularly after it became monstrous
in the '60s and '70s, was apparently laundered through the <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent>)<ent type='NORP'>Han</ent>d Bank in
<ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>. Upon the failure of this bank some 7 years ago, and at the same
time as the alleged suicide of one of the partners, <ent type='PERSON'>Frank Nugan</ent> (1980), it
became clear that <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and US military officers were deeply involved in the
bank and its nefarious operations. A full)blown investigation by the
<ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>n government produced a 4)volume report. It showed that some $50
million in losses were suffered when the bank went down, but untold amounts of
illicit drug money were undoubtedly not accounted for at the time because the
owners of that money didn't want to draw attention to themselves. Strangely
enough, the whole affair of the <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent>)<ent type='NORP'>Han</ent>d failure was hushed up by our
government and many bank records were shredded by former US officials.</p>

<p>Now to Central <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. Cocaine from this area has apparently been imported
into the US in large quantities for years by officials of the US and allied
nations. Some of the funds from these drug sales have apparently supported
the Contra's in Central <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, along with funds from arms sales to <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>.
Here's the mind)blower: The central players in these arms and drug deals seem
always to be the same people: <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent>, a former high <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> official,
Thomas <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent>, always Shackley's assistant, <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Secord</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ired <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent>
major general, and shifting cast of support players. With the exception of
<ent type='ORG'>Secord</ent>, these same people show up in the testimony of Gen. Khun Sa, the
recognized drug kingpin of the <ent type='ORG'>Golden Triangle</ent> (<ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent>)<ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent>)<ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent>).</p>

<p>Khun Sa describes the sale of huge amounts of drugs to some of these US
officials and even notes that the funds were run through <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>n banks.
Lt. Col. "Bo" <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent>, who first exposed this story on a radio talkshow in
southern <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>, has continued his campaign on talkshows throughout the
United States. In almost every show, says <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent>, he will get one or more
calls from <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> vets who describe how they participated or knew of drugs
being shipped either under US auspices or at a minimum with a "wink and a nod"
from officials on the scene.</p>

<p>We should note here that Gen. Khun Sa has offered to stop this drug traffic in
his part of the world but says that for 15 years, he can get "no interest"
from our government. In the videotaped interview with <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent>, Khun Sa even
agreed to provide security for the US and/or UN inspection teams if
they\j\wanted to come in to verify his efforts. Khun Sa's offer is connected
to his request for help for his people in the form of agricultural
instruction, etc. His point is that if he stops the growing of opium, his 8
million people will need help in replacing the income that crop is generating.</p>

<p>To date, his offer has stirred not one iota of interest in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>.
Unbeknownst to <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent>, H. <ent type='PERSON'>Ross Perot</ent> had been working on this same story since
some time in late 1986. <ent type='PERSON'>Perot</ent> took the evidence to <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, presented it
to the Vice President, the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>, and to the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>, and got no help
whatsoever. He even received a call from <ent type='PERSON'>Frank Carlucci</ent>, now head of the
National Security Council, telling him to "stop pursuing" <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent>,
whom Gen Khun Sa named as a big buyer of drugs in <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Armitage</ent> is now Assistant Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ary of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> for International Security.
Former Chief of Special Operations for the US <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> L. Fletcher Prouty
says many <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> officials knew all about the use of drugs to pay some troops in
<ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> during WW II. One who knew was <ent type='PERSON'>Sam Wilson</ent> who ended up as head of the
<ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Intelligence Agency (<ent type='ORG'>DIA</ent>). Prouty also states that this drug trade
was the reason for the start of the <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent>)<ent type='NORP'>Han</ent>d Bank in <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>, and further
states that Michael <ent type='NORP'>Han</ent>d (one of the partners in the bank) worked out of his
office in the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> before he went to <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent> where he met the
<ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent> brothers. Prouty, by the way, assisted Alfred McCoy in the preparation
of his monumental book The Politics of Heroin in SouthEast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent> (Harper &amp; Row,
1972). A lawsuit filed by the leftist <ent type='ORG'>Christic Institute</ent> alleges many of the
above events, naming these and other players. <ent type='ORG'>The Institute</ent> alludes to a
"Sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> Team" that was/is running many of the arms/drug deals.</p>

<p>Much of the outline of this informal organization (if that's what it is) is
also fully covered in US News and World Report (8/10/87, p. 16), with only a
casual mention of the drug trade in the last paragraph. But at least it was
mentioned. An article by <ent type='ORG'>the Wall Street Journal</ent> reporter <ent type='PERSON'>Jonathan Kwitny</ent>
appears in the August)September issue of <ent type='PERSON'>Mother Jones</ent>. Both the reporter and
the magazine are leftist, to say the least. However, Kwitny's recounting of
the <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent>)<ent type='NORP'>Han</ent>d Bank failure was accurate so far as we can tell.</p>

<p>Among the names mentioned by <ent type='PERSON'>Kwitny</ent> are (brace yourself): <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'>Secord</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Eric von Marbod</ent> (another <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> official), 3)star US Gen. LeRoy
Manor (former chief of staff for the entire US Pacific Command), Gen. Edwin
Black (high)ranking intelligence officer and Assistant <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> chief of staff for
<ent type='ORG'>the Pacific</ent>), Gen. <ent type='PERSON'>Earl Cocke</ent>, Jr. (former commander of the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Legion),
<ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> Colby (former <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> director), Adm. Earl "Buddy Yates, Michael <ent type='NORP'>Han</ent>d (<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
veteran), and numerous bit)part players. Then there's the strange story of
former <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agent <ent type='PERSON'>Edwin Wilson</ent>, currently serving a 55)year sentence in
solitary confinement for arms dealing. <ent type='PERSON'>Wilson</ent> has consistently asserted that
his own questionable activities were part of a larger pattern of corruption
and subversion among high <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> officials. According to <ent type='PERSON'>Wilson</ent>, 5
conspirators ) <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Clines</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Secord</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>von Marbod</ent>, and <ent type='PERSON'>Wilson</ent> himself ) met
sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ly in 1978, setting up a partnership to run arms, using the power of
these top bureaucrats. <ent type='PERSON'>Wilson</ent> himself put up $500000 for the operation, and
he says he has a tape recording of the whole transaction. Not only did he
lose his investment, he ended up in the dungeon."</p>

<p>When I saw that I was the only one among all our partners to be indicted and
convicted, I realized that I was being buried for the rest of my life in a
solitary cell so that my former partners could shut me up. I was afraid to
talk," he said. To add to this mystery, it appears clear that the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>
serves as the <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ail distribution for the drugs. <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent>, Santo
Trafficante (<ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> chieftain, now deceased), <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Daniel Arnold</ent>, and
<ent type='PERSON'>Jerry Daniels</ent> (said by Khun Sa to have taken over Armitage's drug duties) are
listed by Khun Sa as handling the enormous drug trade from the Golden
Triangle, and he says, they used <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>n banks to launder the money. Khun
Sa also notes that Thailand's English)language newspaper <ent type='GPE'>Bangkok</ent> Post reported
that <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agents were using <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent> as a transit base for the drug business
and using banks in <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent> for the funds.</p>

<p>Finally, in this strange line up of sources, it's of interest to note that the
US <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> Party newspapers, People's Daily World, and the <ent type='NORP'>communist</ent>
Guardian, have been playing up this story for months. We can attribute this
interest in our "drug problem" by the <ent type='ORG'>Reds</ent> as an attempt to divert attention
from the fact that since 1962 it has been official <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> policy to use
drugs to help being down <ent type='GPE'>the United</ent> States. <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Bulgaria</ent>, etc.,
have all been working from an edict issued by <ent type='PERSON'>Nikita Khrushchev</ent> at a sec<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Warsaw Pact</ent> meeting in <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent> in 1962.</p>

<p>It may be only coincidence that involvement by our government officials seemed
to pick up steam at about the same time. Several aspects of this story are
appalling to us. First, we are dismayed that we find material in far)left
publications with which we agree. But even a stopped clock is right twice a
day. Second, there is an enormous amount of corroborative material being sent
to our office nearly every day. It supports the conclusion that a formal or
informal organization of high <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and US military officers, some former, some
present, exists which has for decades been a major ) if not the major )
importer of heroin and cocaine into the US.</p>

<p>Third, the same players show up nearly everywhere where drugs and arms are
involved. The only place Gen. Secord's name has not appeared is in connection
with the Khun Sa story in <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent>. It's also of interest that much of this
activity occurred while Vice President <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent> was in charge of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.
It's strange that <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> does not seem to be interested (based on the lack of
cooperation given <ent type='PERSON'>Perot</ent> when he visited him) in stopping this drug business.
And <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> is "the top cop" appointed by President Reagan to handle this drug
problem.</p>

<p>The mere fact that the mass media has completely ignored this abundance of
evidence is further indication of the probability that very high members of
the Establishment are deeply involved. Only <ent type='ORG'>CBS</ent> TV in the "West 57th Street"
broadcasts have dealt with the Central <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> connection and that show ranks
at the bottom in the ratings. The <ent type='ORG'>Golden Triangle</ent> connection has yet to be
looked into. We were told by a <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> reporter for the Christian
Broadcast Network (<ent type='ORG'>CBN</ent>) that one reason the major TV networks have not touched
the <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> story is that lawyers for <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent> called each of them\j\and
said: "If you run the story, we'll sue". With the <ent type='PERSON'>Westmoreland</ent> case still
vividly imprinted on the minds of network executives, the threat has
apparently worked. We have heard that a major overseas network is planning a
story sometime in the next 6 months. If this story is correct in it's broad
outline ) and there is strong evidence for this ) we are looking at the worst
scandal in government corruption in US history.</p>

<p>There is simply no other way to describe it. In brief, here is what appears
to be factual: The US government has outlawed various drugs since 1914 with
the explicit intent of driving up the price to make them more difficult to
obtain. Then this same government has for decades actually participated in
the importation of these very same drugs! The <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> has served as the <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ailer
for our government. In the latter years of this decadent operation, drug
monies have allegedly been used to fund some Freedom Fighter operations,
particularly in <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent> and Central <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. It's very possible that the
recipients of this dirty money didn't know of its origins. It's even more
likely that huge amounts of money from these illicit operations stuck to the
hands of the major players. We also think it's possible, although we've seen
little evidence to support it, that there is an involvement by the big
international banks.</p>

<p>The closest we've come to proof is in the book The Underground Empire: Where
Crime and Government Embrace, by <ent type='PERSON'>James Mills</ent> (Doubleday, $22.95). Perhaps the
most discouraging aspect of this whole grimy situation is that there is so
little interest among government officials and the mass media. It seems that
only a demand from the grass)roots, reaching some critical mass of mail, can
stir an investigation into this dirty business and bring it to a halt. Your
congressman must hear from you. You must demand action. You must demand the
major TV networks get on this story. You must demand that your newspaper
conduct its own investigation and print the results. You, dear friend, hold
the key. You, by your actions, will determine whether this practice continues
or is stopped.</p>

<p>THE <ent type='ORG'>DEA</ent>TH IN ARIZONA OF THE <ent type='ORG'>KEMPER</ent> MARLEY MACHINE</p>

<p>I expected the sky to fall after my July article linking the activities of
<ent type='PERSON'>Charles Keating</ent> and General <ent type='PERSON'>Singlaub</ent>. Nothing happened. The reaction to my
September article exposing <ent type='PERSON'>Terry Burke</ent>, former top <ent type='ORG'>DEA</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> as a
possible key element in the illegal narcotics network in <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent>, however, was
immediate and unmistakable. Within days of my FAXing this story I was served
with a court summons, a nasty death threat was left on my answering machine
and my offices were entered, my files, book cases and furniture dumped and
overturned.</p>

<p>The last few days there has been a 6 foot 6 inch <ent type='NORP'>Latino</ent> following myself and
an associate. He makes the top hit man for the <ent type='GPE'>Medellin</ent> cartel look like a
sissy. Since <ent type='PERSON'>Terry Burke</ent>, the former <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> station chief in <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent> who
administered <ent type='ORG'>the Phoenix</ent> Assassination Program has been closely associated
with <ent type='PERSON'>Theodore Shackley</ent> since 1962, this revelation coming in the wake of the
unsolved <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent> murders must have sent shock waves far and wide. Ted
<ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> was <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent>'s number 2 man at <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> when <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> was <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> Director.
Among those in the know, Ted <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> and an operative named <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Armitage</ent>
are the weakest points in the armor of <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent> and <ent type='EVENT'>the New World</ent> Order.</p>

<p>More significantly, I am tempted to speculate that this revelation, coupled
with my suggestion of a probable heroin connection to the military style
execution of the 9 <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent> monks, lead to the panic arrest of five innocent
<ent type='GPE'>Tucson</ent> kids for the murder of the monks. Supposedly, on the basis of a tip
received Sept. 3 from a patient in a mental hospital, the deputies of Maricopa
County Sheriff, <ent type='PERSON'>Tom Agnos</ent>, arrested and charged four <ent type='NORP'>hispanic</ent> and one black
youth, all selected from the poorest neighborhoods of <ent type='GPE'>Tucson</ent>. It was apparent
from the start that this action was bogus.</p>

<p>First, law enforcement alleged that these youths stole a late model Bronco and
a Blazer that were seen at <ent type='LOC'>the Temple the day</ent> of the crime. These vehicles
were never reported stolen! Where are these vehicles today? If these kids were
in fact criminal elements, wouldn't they have driven these four wheeled all
terrain vehicles across the border to <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent> where they would have been worth
more than in the U.S.? They could have made a quick $15000 doing this. I
visited the Temple. It is more than obvious that there was nothing of value
there.</p>

<p>Rapidly the case against the kids began disintegrating. One suspect was
working at a dog track during the murders and was video taped performing his
duties. He had to be released. It soon became clear that there was no
physical evidence linking the youths to the crime ))) only their confessions
)))), confessions that the <ent type='PERSON'>Dean</ent> of the Law School at <ent type='ORG'>ASU</ent> says can not be used
in court because they were so obviously coerced. It turns out that the
deputies worked on the youths for 12 hours in separate rooms with no windows
))) no food or water ))) in the midst of serious threats.</p>

<p>One youth was told that he would be "found in a lake with an anchor wrapped
around his neck if he did not cooperate". This precess took place not at
police headquarters but in separate rooms of a hotel. The attorney for Dante
Parker, said to be the ringleader, has submitted a list of 25 witnesses that
say the suspect never left <ent type='GPE'>Tucson</ent> the night in question.</p>

<p>The <ent type='NORP'>Thai</ent> ambassador "just happened to be in <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent>" for the arrests. During
one short sound byte he repeated three times that his being in <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent> was
just coincidence. His praise for <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> law enforcement sounded a bit too
lavish for the circumstances. All readers can be assured that the smiling
<ent type='NORP'>Thai</ent> ambassador is no stranger to the politics of heroin in Southeast <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>.
Equally as disingenuous was the statement of the Sheriff that there was no
racism involved in the crime )))) (but only in the selection process of the
scapegoats.)</p>

<p>When Lt. Col. James Bo <ent type='ORG'>Gritz</ent> <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urned to the <ent type='ORG'>Golden Triangle</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent> in 1987
to video tape the drug overlord, General Khun Sa, naming the names of the U.S.
officials who were the general's largest customers for heroin, he was startled
to find that a two lane highway had been constructed in the 5 months since he
was last there. This highway, which went right to the general's front door,
was built by the <ent type='NORP'>Thai</ent> government using <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> plows left over from the <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>
war. Coming out, as the Colonel went in, were 10 ton trucks, covered and
loaded, with the <ent type='NORP'>Thai</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> insignia on the side. There is only one product
that comes out of the <ent type='ORG'>Golden Triangle</ent> )))) heroin! It is a certainty that the
smiling <ent type='NORP'>Thai</ent> ambassador has an accounting of every truck.</p>

<p>The importance of the discovery of this heroin highway lies in the fact that
what had trickled out on the backs of horses and mules now flows out in 10 ton
trucks. This highway, which is easily verifiable with satellite imaging, is
to this day denied by our government. When Col. Gritz's team lead Tom
Jerrills of <ent type='ORG'>CBS</ent> 20\20 in to meet with Khun Sa, none of the trucks seen in the
Colonel's video tapes were seen by <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> viewers. There was even phoney
footage of <ent type='ORG'>Jarrells</ent> riding on a mule and no shot of the <ent type='ORG'>Toyota</ent> pick)up that
actually carried him there.</p>

<p>It so happens that the people associated with the Temple think there was a
narcotics connection. <ent type='PERSON'>Fong Miller</ent> lost both her mother and daughter in the
massacre. When I told her that I thought <ent type='ORG'>the Phoenix</ent>\<ent type='GPE'>Bangkok</ent> heroin
connection factored into the slayings, her words were, "That is what we think
also." Absolutely no speculation to this effect has surfaced in newspapers
here.</p>

<p>Last year Phoenicians were shocked to find that the state government had
committed to a $30 million toxic waste incinerator which was well under
construction by the time anyone learned of it. The selected management
company, E<ent type='ORG'>NSC</ent>O, had an abysmal safety record everywhere they had existed.</p>

<p>In order to satisfy the public hearing requirement, a remote hearing site
located 40 miles outside <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent> was selected. The deputies of <ent type='PERSON'>Tom Agnos</ent> were
issued stun guns and pictures of <ent type='ORG'>GREENPEACE</ent> toxics expert, <ent type='PERSON'>Brad Angel</ent>, and
instructed to respond with "maximum force" to "environmental terrorism".</p>

<p>In order to further stifle public outcry, the high school auditorium was
partitioned so that only 25% was useable. Frictions developed when most of
the 400 people who showed up were told to go home there was not enough room
for them. TV viewers that night were horrified at the spectacle of a 65 year
old lady being repeatedly zapped by the deputies with the stun guns. She was
not even one of the environmentalists. This incident coupled with the arrests
of the innocent <ent type='GPE'>Tucson</ent> kids would insure a speedy trip down the toilet for
<ent type='PERSON'>Agnos</ent> and his top confederates in any other municipality in the nation.</p>

<p>The previous sheriff distinguished himself by placing an ad in the classified
section of the ARIZONA REPUBLIC for truck drivers, then busting two
respondents for trucking cargos arranged by the sheriff. He also had one of
his informers fly a plane load of marijuana in from <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent> so that he could
have members of the press available at the landing site to witness the arrest
of those meeting the plane. He survived both incidents. Hopefully <ent type='PERSON'>Agnos</ent> will
not be as lucky.</p>

<p>The reader is probably asking how could such things happen. For the answer to
this we must do what Col. Fletcher Prouty advises, "Go back and examine the
beginnings." <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> is <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Kemper</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent></ent> territory. <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Kemper</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent></ent> was the big
man in <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent>.</p>

<p>In 1948 fifty two employees of <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Kemper</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent></ent>'s <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> liquor monopoly, UNITED
LIQUOR, went to prison on federal liquor violations, including <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Hensley</ent>,
the father)in)law of Senator <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> McCain. <ent type='ORG'>Hensley</ent> was the General Manager of
<ent type='ORG'>UNITED LIQUOR</ent>. On the basis of this, some people might feel <ent type='ORG'>UNITED LIQUOR</ent>
could be described as organized crime. The slick attorney who kept <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> out
of this trial and out of prison and sent McCain's father)in)law to prison in
his place was <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> Rendquist )))) currently the Chief Justice of the U.S.
Supreme <ent type='ORG'>Court</ent>!</p>

<p>It was the judgement of this court that <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Hensley</ent> would be prohibited from
working in the liquor industry from then on. Of course such judgments meant
nothing to <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent>. After <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Hensley</ent> got out of prison, <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> arranged a
BUDWIESSER distributorship for <ent type='ORG'>Hensley</ent> which is now in the hands of Senator
<ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> McCain and reported to be worth $200 million.</p>

<p>The best source for an introduction to the environment of total corruption
which exists in <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> is <ent type='ORG'>THE ARIZONA</ent> PROJECT: HOW A TEAM OF INVESTIGATIVE
RE<ent type='ORG'>PORTERS</ent> GOT REVENGE ON <ent type='ORG'>DEA</ent>DLINE. This expose was written by Michael
<ent type='GPE'>Wendland</ent> who was part of the group called INVESTIGATIVE RE<ent type='ORG'>PORTERS</ent> AND EDITORS
that came to <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent> in the aftermath of the car bombing of the ARIZONA
REPUBLIC's investigative reporter, <ent type='PERSON'>Don Bolles</ent>. It was the conclusion of this
group that <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent>, by far the wealthiest man in <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent>, was behind this
murder.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to believe that <ent type='PERSON'>Don Bolles</ent> was not killed because he
was a white knight. When <ent type='GPE'>Bolles</ent> testified before the <ent type='ORG'>HOUSE</ent> ORGANIZED CRIME
COMMITTEE, he required immunity. Why? The best clue to his death lies in his
last words ))) "<ent type='PERSON'>Adamson</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>EMPRISE</ent> the <ent type='ORG'>mafia</ent>". <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Adamson</ent> was the hit man
contracted by the establishment attorney, <ent type='PERSON'>Neal Roberts</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>EMPRISE</ent> was a dog
track interest which had changed its name from <ent type='ORG'>SPORTSERVICE</ent>. There existed
the <ent type='GPE'>Maricopa County</ent> Superior <ent type='ORG'>Court</ent> Case # C)286651 <ent type='ORG'>SPORTSERVICE</ent> v. JARVIS,
<ent type='ORG'>STEIGER</ent> which was available to anyone interested in the motive for this crime.
Exhibits in this case allege that <ent type='GPE'>Bolles</ent>, who was visibly living beyond his
means, was wheeling and dealing with the gangsters. Today the <ent type='ORG'>EMPRISE</ent>
CORPORATION continues to flourish in <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> under the name DELAWARE NORTH.
<ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> McCain has been observed visiting the principals.</p>

<p>A good companion reader to <ent type='ORG'>the ARIZONA PROJECT</ent> is THE LAST RAMPAGE OF GARY
TYSON. Written by a journalism professor from the UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA, this
book documents how top authorities in <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> let <ent type='PERSON'>Gary Tyson</ent> escape from
prison after he succeeded in carrying out a contract hit on another inmate,
<ent type='PERSON'>Tony Sera</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>Sera</ent> was giving affidavits regarding the land fraud of <ent type='PERSON'>Ned Warren</ent>.
It is the thesis of this book that this contract was given by establishment
attorney, <ent type='PERSON'>Neal Roberts</ent>, who was described in <ent type='ORG'>the ARIZONA PROJECT</ent> as the murder
broker in the <ent type='GPE'>Bolles</ent> killing.</p>

<p>According to intelligence sources of <ent type='ORG'>the Phoenix</ent> police, who prepared a
background profile of <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Kemper</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent></ent> the week following the <ent type='GPE'>Bolles</ent> murder,
<ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> was at one time directly connected to the remnants of the old Al Capone
mob, operating the TRANS<ent type='GPE'>AMERICA</ent> WIRE SERVICE. This betting service was
originally established in 1941 for Capone's heirs by <ent type='PERSON'>Gus Greenbaum</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Greenbaum</ent>
was a <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent> socialite seen at all the society balls in <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent>, usually in
the company of <ent type='ORG'>the Bar</ent>ry Goldwaters and <ent type='PERSON'>Harry Rosenzweigs</ent>. In 1958 <ent type='PERSON'>Greenbaum</ent>
and his wife were found dead in their bed )))) their throats cut. This
inaugurated a series of grisly gangland)style slayings.</p>

<p>When <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> died, July 1990, he owned 5 square miles of <ent type='GPE'>Carefree</ent> ))) the
highest priced real estate in <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent>. The smallest lot in this most
exclusive township is zoned for one acre. By some coincidence the Tax
Accessors made the same mistake evaluating Marley's properties as he did on
<ent type='PERSON'>Charlie Keating</ent>'s properties. This oversight was saving <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> a million
dollars a year. Of course the official investigation showed no wrongdoing in
either case.</p>

<p>For the last 40 years <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> bankrolled <ent type='PERSON'>Harry Rosenzweig</ent> who doled out
Marley's great wealth to a slate of <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> candidates who were almost
universally successful in obtaining high political office. <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> was able to
control <ent type='ORG'>the Democratic party</ent> as well. Every congressman and every senator in
<ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> currently owes his position to the <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> machine.</p>

<p>Dennis <ent type='PERSON'>DeConcini</ent> was facing a tough reelection in 1990, seeing as how he was
nailed creaming off a cool $5 million with his family on an <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> land deal
dependent on the Senator's inside senatorial knowledge. The last thing in the
world the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>s wanted was to loose DeConcini's seniority. Before any
other <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>s could announce, the party hierarchy formally announced their
support for the weakest candidate that one could imagine. The opponent, Keith
DeGreen, had ties to the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> Party that were so weak he had not even
voted in the last 2 elections.</p>

<p>At one point <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> served as Chairman of <ent type='ORG'>the Board</ent> of the VALLEY NATIONAL
BANK. When <ent type='PERSON'>Bugsy Siegel</ent>, on instructions from <ent type='ORG'>Meyer Lansky</ent>, built the
FLAMINGO CLUB, <ent type='GPE'>Las Vegas</ent>'s first casino, the money was borrowed from the
<ent type='ORG'>VALLEY NATIONAL BANK</ent>. Involvements in narcotics trafficking on the part of
<ent type='ORG'>VALLEY NATIONAL BANK</ent> are hinted in <ent type='ORG'>the ARIZONA PROJECT</ent>.</p>

<p>Al <ent type='PERSON'>Lizanetz</ent>, who served as Kemper's public relations man for 25 years, is one
of the richest sources for background on the liquor magnate. The <ent type='GPE'>Bolles</ent>
murder was part of a package deal that was to include a hit on <ent type='PERSON'>Lizanetz</ent>.
According to <ent type='PERSON'>Lizanetz</ent>, the <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> machine placed the highest priority on
placing lawyers in all the key state and municipal positions. Former Attorney
General <ent type='PERSON'>Bob Corbin</ent>, who accepted a $55000 campaign contribution from Charles
<ent type='PERSON'>Keating</ent> in a race where he was unopposed, worked for <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> (in the insurance
industry) in the 50s as did the preceding 2 AGs.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> placed his people in the top positions of <ent type='ORG'>the Department</ent> of Public
Safety. The county prosecutor was also key to him. <ent type='PERSON'>Lizanetz</ent> claims that
<ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> recruited <ent type='PERSON'>Eugene Pullium</ent> to come to <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent> to start the ARIZONA
REPUBLIC/<ent type='GPE'>PHOENIX</ent> <ent type='ORG'>GAZZETT</ent>, the monopoly newspaper here which has succeeded in
covering up these matters. Pullium then started the <ent type='GPE'>PHOENIX</ent> 40 a group of the
largest business interests who virtually run the state. <ent type='PERSON'>Eugene Pullium</ent> is the
grandfather of <ent type='PERSON'>Dan Quayle</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>The ARIZONA REPUBLIC</ent>/<ent type='GPE'>PHOENIX</ent> <ent type='ORG'>GAZZETT</ent> together with
the IN<ent type='ORG'>DIA</ent>NAPOLIS STAR are reported to be worth $5 billion. <ent type='PERSON'>Lizanetz</ent> claims
that <ent type='PERSON'>Ned Warren</ent>, responsible for half a billion dollars of land fraud in
<ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent>, was another agent of <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Kemper</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent></ent>.</p>

<p>Marley's mentor was <ent type='PERSON'>Sam Bronfman</ent>, the progenitor of the SEAGRAMS empire. When
<ent type='PERSON'>Bronfman</ent> visited <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> he came in the company of Al Capone.
<ent type='PERSON'>Lizanetz</ent> claims that <ent type='PERSON'>Jack Ruby</ent>, assassin of Lee <ent type='PERSON'>Harvey</ent> Oswald, was also on the
<ent type='PERSON'>Bronfman</ent> payroll.</p>

<p>Perhaps by now readers are beginning to understand how a phenomena like
<ent type='PERSON'>Charles Keating</ent> could arise in such a political climate. It is not necessary
to mention how lavishly <ent type='PERSON'>Keating</ent> paid off the local politicians. <ent type='PERSON'>DeConcini</ent>
$72000 ))) McCain $112000 ))) a shopping center deal with McCain's wife that
netted almost a half million in 6 months ))) a $200 million dollar unsecured
load to DeConcini's campaign manager, <ent type='PERSON'>Ron Ober</ent>. This only scratches the
surface. All cannot be told in so short an article. With this background let
us examine more in more detail.</p>

<p>There is a certain law firm in <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent> which includes as principals two former
<ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> U.S. Attorneys, <ent type='PERSON'>Melvin Mcdonald</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Mike Hawkins</ent>. One was appointed
by <ent type='NORP'>Democrats</ent> and the other by <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>s )) giving them a lock on political
leverage here. Like <ent type='PERSON'>Robert Peloquin</ent>, former head of the Organized Crime
Strike Force of the Justice Department, they learned quickly that they could
make 20 times as much money working for the criminals. <ent type='ORG'>Melvin</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>McDonald</ent> was
chief council for <ent type='PERSON'>Charles Keating</ent>. Whenever anything of particularly bad odor
needed to happen in <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> one of these slimebags was called in.</p>

<p>A case in point was the scandal surrounding the sale of <ent type='ORG'>the BIG BOQUEUS RANCH</ent>
to the <ent type='NORP'>Navajo</ent> nation. This matter was so stinky it called for the diligence
of <ent type='PERSON'>Mike Hawkins</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Melvin Mcdonald</ent>. It so happened that back in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>
D.C. Dennis <ent type='PERSON'>DeConcini</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> McCain were getting heat from their colleagues
about all the swindles of the indian lands. As a matter of fact McCain and
<ent type='PERSON'>DeConcini</ent> were leading the charge of these swindlers. Keating's acquisition
of his <ent type='ORG'>Estrella</ent> property, in a round about way, involved a swindle of indian
lands.</p>

<p>The definition of a politician: Anyone, who, when being tared and feathered
and ridden out of town on a rail can make it appear as if they are leading a
parade. In true fashion, McCain and <ent type='PERSON'>DeConcini</ent>, got themselves appointed
co)chairman of a <ent type='ORG'>senate</ent> investigative committee to delve into these crimes
against the indians. Enter <ent type='PERSON'>McDonald</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Hawkins</ent>.</p>

<p>The BIG BOQUEUS RANCH was purchased in the mourning by developers <ent type='PERSON'>Bud Brown</ent>
and his partner for $19 million and sold that afternoon for $27 million to
<ent type='ORG'>Tribal</ent> Chief Peter <ent type='PERSON'>McDonald</ent> (no relation) on behalf of the <ent type='NORP'>Navajo</ent> nation. Bud
Brown and his partner made a quick $8 million. In order to explore this
corruption, McCain and <ent type='PERSON'>DeConcini</ent> granted immunity to <ent type='PERSON'>Bud Brown</ent> and his partner
so that they could give testimony about the $10000 and the <ent type='ORG'>BMW</ent> that they gave
as a bribe to the corrupt indian chief. Meanwhile the ARIZONA REPUBLIC
repeatedly hammered the indian chief day after day while not mentioning Bud
Brown. The indian chief was removed from office. The Pulitzer Prize winning
journalist, <ent type='PERSON'>Tom Fitzpatric</ent>, in a Feb. 15, 1989 NEW <ent type='ORG'>TIME</ent>S article called this
"the best real estate deal between white men and red men since the purchase of
<ent type='GPE'>Manhattan</ent>."</p>

<p>Another example is <ent type='ORG'>the Bar</ent>tel Cocaine case. Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Bartel</ent> was caught
with 81 pounds of cocaine after police observed him meeting with <ent type='PERSON'>Stan Akers</ent>,
Jr., a notorious cocaine broker. <ent type='PERSON'>Akers</ent> was the son of the former <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent>
Speaker of <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> of Representatives. Here is an example of how the
narcotics industry is politically protected in <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Akers</ent> was previously
convicted of possession of 6 pounds of cocaine and sentenced to 5 years in
prison. After being sentenced, <ent type='PERSON'>Akers</ent> told the D.A. he would testify about the
unsolved drug murder of Greg Case which he had witnessed. On <ent type='PERSON'>Akers</ent>' testimony
<ent type='PERSON'>Paul Brookover</ent> was sent to prison and <ent type='PERSON'>Akers</ent> walked free. Knowledgeable people
close to this case believe <ent type='PERSON'>Akers</ent> ordered the hit.</p>

<p>The police found $3 million in bonds in the safe deposit box of Dr. <ent type='ORG'>Bartel</ent>.
Bartel's father)in)law, Al <ent type='PERSON'>Burke</ent>, came forward to claim that the $3 million
was his and that his son)in)law was only keeping it safe for him. Naturally
<ent type='PERSON'>Burke</ent> <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ained former U.S. Attorney, <ent type='PERSON'>Mike Hawkins</ent>, to represent him in this
matter and in a few days the U.S. Attorney's office "<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urned" the bonds.
Anyone having to establish their financial affairs for the <ent type='ORG'>IRS</ent> over a 20 year
period knows that this can not be done in a few days.</p>

<p>Like the saber toothed tiger, the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Kemper</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent></ent> machine will die of its own
success. Having harnessed all of society's watch dogs on its tightly held
leash there remains no restraint upon the unbounded greed of its members.
Eventually it will be beyond the powers of the ARIZONA REPUBLIC to keep
matters covered up. The largess of <ent type='PERSON'>Charles Keating</ent> pushed greed past the
point of no <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urn. This accelerating stealing contest can have only one
conclusion. Some day soon the voters of <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> will take possession of the
government here. They came very close to doing this with Governor Ev Mecham.</p>

<p>THE <ent type='ORG'>DEA</ent>TH OF THE <ent type='ORG'>KEMPER</ent> MARLEY MACHINE</p>

of this trial and sent McCain's father)in)law to prison in his place was
<ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> Rendquist )))) currently the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme <ent type='ORG'>Court</ent>!</p>

<p>It was the judgement of the court that <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Hensley</ent> would be prohibited from
working in the liquor industry ever again. Of course such judgments meant
nothing to <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent>. When <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Hensley</ent> got out of prison <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> arranged a
BUDWIESSER distributorship for <ent type='ORG'>Hensley</ent> which is now in the hands of <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent>
McCain and reported to be worth $200 million.</p>

<p>The best source for an introduction to the environment of total corruption in
<ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> is <ent type='ORG'>THE ARIZONA</ent> PROJECT: HOW A TEAM OF INVESTIGATIVE RE<ent type='ORG'>PORTERS</ent> GOT

arranged by the establishment attorney, <ent type='PERSON'>Neal Roberts</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>EMPRISE</ent> was a dog track

#xxxxxx <ent type='ORG'>SPORTSERVICE</ent> V JARVIS <ent type='PERSON'>STIEGER</ent> available to anyone interested in the
motive which contained all the plausible reasons for this hit. Exhibits in
this case aligadge that <ent type='GPE'>Bolles</ent>, who was visibly living beyond his means, was
wheeling and dealing with the gangsters.</p>

<p>A good companion reader to this is THE LAST RAMPAGE OF <ent type='PERSON'>GARY TYSON</ent>. Written by

<p>Marley's mentor was <ent type='PERSON'>Sam Braufman</ent>, the progenitor of the SEAGRAMS empire. When
<ent type='ORG'>Braufman</ent> visited <ent type='PERSON'>Marley</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> he came in the company of Al Capone.
<ent type='PERSON'>Lizanetz</ent> claims that <ent type='PERSON'>Jack Ruby</ent>, assassin of Lee <ent type='PERSON'>Harvey</ent> Oswald, was also on the
<ent type='ORG'>Braufman</ent> payroll.</p>

<p>Perhaps by now readers are beginning to understand how a phenomena like
<ent type='PERSON'>Charles Keating</ent> could arise in such a climate. I don't need to mention how
lavishly <ent type='PERSON'>Keating</ent> paid off the local politicians here. <ent type='PERSON'>DeConcini</ent> $72000.
McCain $112000. A shopping center deal with McCain's wife that netted almost
a half million in 6 months. A $200 million dollar unsecured load to
DeConcini's campaign manager, <ent type='PERSON'>Ron Ober</ent>. This only scratches the surface. All
cannot be told is so short an article. With this as background let me now
provide some detail.</p>

<p>There is a certain law firm which includes as principals two former <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent>
U.S. Attorneys, <ent type='PERSON'>Melvin Mcdonald</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Mike Hawkins</ent>. One man was appointed by
<ent type='NORP'>Democrats</ent> and the other by <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>s giving them a lock on political
leverage here. Like <ent type='PERSON'>Robert Peloquin</ent>, former head of the Organized Crime
Strike Force of the Justice Department they learned that they could make 20
times as much money working for the criminals. <ent type='ORG'>Melvin</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>McDonald</ent> was the chief
council for <ent type='PERSON'>Charles Keating</ent>. When ever anything of particularly bad odor
needs to happen one of these slimebags is called in.</p>

<p>A case in point was the scandal surrounding the sale of <ent type='ORG'>the BIG BOQUES RANCH</ent>
to the <ent type='NORP'>Navajo</ent> nation. This matter was so stinky it called for the diligence
of both <ent type='PERSON'>Mike Hawkins</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Melvin Mcdonald</ent>. It so happened that back in
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> D.C. Dennis <ent type='PERSON'>DeConcini</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> McCain were getting heat from their
colleagues about all the swindles of the indian lands. As a matter of fact
McCain and <ent type='PERSON'>DeConcini</ent> were leading the charge of the swindlers. Keating's
acquisition of his <ent type='ORG'>Estrella</ent> property in a round about way involved a swindle
of indian lands.</p>

<p>The definition of a politician: Anyone who, when they are being tared and
feathered and ridden out of town on a rail can make it appear as if they are
leading a parade. In true fashion, McCain and <ent type='PERSON'>DeConcini</ent>, got themselves
appointed co)chairman of a <ent type='ORG'>senate</ent> investigative committee to delve into these
crimes against the indians. Enter <ent type='PERSON'>McDonald</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Hawkins</ent>. The big <ent type='ORG'>Boq</ent> ranch
was purchased in the mourning by developers <ent type='PERSON'>Bud Brown</ent> and his partnerT h) Tfor
$19 million and sold that afternoon for $27 million to Peter <ent type='PERSON'>McDonald</ent> (no
relation to <ent type='ORG'>Melvin</ent>) on behalf of the <ent type='NORP'>Navajo</ent> nation. <ent type='PERSON'>Bud Brown</ent> and his partner
made a quick $8 million. In order to explore this corruption, McCain and
<ent type='PERSON'>DeConcini</ent> granted immunity to <ent type='PERSON'>Bud Brown</ent> and his partner so that they could
give testimony about the $10000 and the <ent type='ORG'>BMW</ent> that gave as a bribe to the
corrupt indian chief. Meanwhile the ARIZONA REPUBLIC repeatedly hammered the
indian chief day after day while not mentioning <ent type='PERSON'>Bud Brown</ent>. The Pulitzer Prize
winning journalist, <ent type='PERSON'>Tom Fitzpatric</ent>, in a Feb. 15, 1989 NEW <ent type='ORG'>TIME</ent>S article
called this "the best real estate deal between white men and red men since the
purchase of <ent type='GPE'>Manhattan</ent>."</p>

<p>Another example is <ent type='ORG'>the Bar</ent>tel Cocaine case. Dr. <ent type='PERSON'>William</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Bartel</ent> was caught
with 81 pounds of cocaine after police observed him meeting with <ent type='PERSON'>Stan Akers</ent>,
Jr., a notorious cocaine broker here. <ent type='PERSON'>Akers</ent> was the son of the former <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent>
Speaker of <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> of Representatives. As an example of how the narcotics
industry is politically protected <ent type='PERSON'>Akers</ent> was convicted of possession of 6
pounds of cocaine and sentenced to 5 years in prison. After being sentenced,
<ent type='PERSON'>Akers</ent> told the D.A. he would testify about an unsolved drug murder of Greg
Case which he had witnessed. On <ent type='PERSON'>Akers</ent>' testimony <ent type='PERSON'>Paul Brookover</ent> was sent to
prison and <ent type='PERSON'>Akers</ent> walked free. Knowledgeable people close to this case believe
<ent type='PERSON'>Akers</ent> ordered the hit.</p>

<p>The police found $3 million in bonds in the safe deposit box of Dr. <ent type='ORG'>Bartel</ent>.
Bartel's father)in)law, Al <ent type='PERSON'>Burke</ent>, came forward to claim that the $3 million
was his and that his son)in)law was only keeping it safe for him. Naturally
<ent type='PERSON'>Burke</ent> <ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>ained former U.S. Attorney, <ent type='PERSON'>Mike Hawkins</ent> to represent him in this
matter and in a few days the U.S. Attorney's office "<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent>urned" the bonds.
Anyone having to establish their financial affairs for the <ent type='ORG'>IRS</ent> over a 20 year
period knows that this can not be done in a few days.</p>

<p>I spoke with <ent type='PERSON'>Jim Lacey</ent>, Assistant U.S. Attorney responsible for all
prosecutions of large narcotics cases in <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent>. He admitted the
irregularities of the <ent type='GPE'>AMERICA</ent> WEST pilots case and the $300 million dollars
LAGUANA <ent type='ORG'>ARMY</ent> AIR FORCE BASE cocaine incident. He expressed his reg<ent type='ORG'>ret</ent> that
the statute of limitations had run out. Checking the dates I find that there
is still 8 weeks before these cases are dead. If the U.S. Attorney's office
will not respond I propose empaneling a Citizen's Investigative <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>.</p>

<p>A good example</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>THE SILENT</ent> WAR</p>

<p> We are engaged in a silent war. Those waging this brutal conflict have
not the decency to inform their victims ))) who include ourselves and
almost everyone we know. Their standard bearers include <ent type='PERSON'>George Bush</ent> and
<ent type='PERSON'>David</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>. As the high priced professional liars in the mass
media assure us all is well, the common people of the world are being
crushed ))) like foot soldiers over run by a panzer division.</p>

<p> And yet, the only real power of these perpetrators derives only from this
force fed ignorance. Apart from the power to keep us fighting each
other, the <ent type='ORG'>Monopolists</ent> have no power. If a critical mass of people can
learn the information contained herein, and what is more important, the
sources of this information, a global reign of terror will end.</p>
