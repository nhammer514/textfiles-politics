Gravity Resonance? What is this nut talking about?????
------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p> You are probably thinking, "how can gravity possibly be resonant?" This is
a good question. As discovered by <ent type='PERSON'>Thomas Townsend Brown</ent>, electricity is
directly related to gravity (see his U.S. patents 1974483, 3187206 in
particular.) If this is so, it is most likely a vectorial relationship (law of
opposites), and since there is already an electromagnetic vector (2
dimensional), a gravitational vector would be at 90 degrees to both the
magnetic and the electric vectors (since we are in a 3 dimensional space.) The
gravitational vector is like the "duration in time" of the electric and
magnetic vectors. There are also, in addition to scalar electric and magnetic
waves (see Bearden, Thomas E. "Toward a new electromagnetics: part IV: vectors
and mechanisms clarified. <ent type='PERSON'>Tesla</ent> Book Co., Millbrae, California, 1983. This
work, however, fails to mention gravity waves, although it does mention
controlling gravity), there are also scalar gravitic waves (see <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent>, L.H and
A. <ent type='ORG'>Vilenkin</ent>. "A gravitational analogue of the Aharanov-Bohm effect." Journal of
Physics A. Mathematical, Nuclear, and General. (Great Britan). 14(9), Sep.
1981. p. 2353-2357.)</p>

Okay. So There are gravity waves. How can resonating them control reality?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p> All of the above has been proven; this is where basically theory comes in.
There has been much supposed experimental proof of these effects, however all
current research is, unfortuneatly, proprietary, and it is extremely hard to
come by anything helpful. The only good sources of information are some small
mail order book stores, and no one store has everything. One example of
publicized experimental proof is the information regarding the largely ignored
<ent type='ORG'>bierfield</ent> brown effect, whereby gravity can be nullified and even reversed due
to electric charge (see <ent type='PERSON'>Thomas Townsend Brown</ent>, Above patents), and the book on
the philidelphia experiment (and NOT THE <ent type='NORP'>MOVIE</ent>! The movie was fiction, the book
is an attempt to analyze what little fact is known.) The true philidelphia
experiment, if it actually occured, used a <ent type='ORG'>navy</ent> ship degausser modified to act
as some type of resonant gravity vector coil.</p>

<p> The actual theory is that, since electricity can be "transmitt
d" through the ether through electric scalar and vector waves, and magnetic
energy through magnetic scalar and vector waves, why not gravitational scalar
and vector waves, if they do exist (law of opposites)? A gravity wave is the
emporal "shape" of the electric and magnetic vector (I hope this is a good
explanation!), and by changing this shape you are changing the mole
ular construction of the matter (or lack thereof) transmitting the waves
Also, since there are an infinite number of paralell, real universes (see
Hypernumbers II, by <ent type='PERSON'>Charles Muses</ent>, January 1978 "Applied Mathematics and
Computation", and his introduction to <ent type='PERSON'>Jerome Rothstein</ent>'s "Communication,
Organization, and Science," The Falcon's Wing Press, <ent type='NORP'>Indian</ent> Hills, CO, 1958),
the gravity vector coil MAY allow the psychic (scalar electromagnetic brain
wave) postulation of reality through the G-vector. This could also be done with
a computer, but both are beyond the scope of this paper. I will now present the
plans for the construction of a simple G-vector coil. What you do with it from
here is up to you, show it to your physics teachers and have them look up the
references and watch their eyes pop as they find out the speed of light is NOT
constant.</p>

Parts List
------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p> This, actually, is the hardest part. You will either have to spend a lot
of $$$ at a plastics company or have some good friends to get but one of the
parts needed, the others should be fairly easy.</p>

<p> Listed in order of availability</p>

<p> (2) 50 <ent type='ORG'>VDC</ent> (DC-10 <ent type='ORG'>MHZ</ent> preferred, but...) @ 10A, 50KV isolated power
supplies</p>

<p> (parts list for those:)</p>

<p> (2) 110 <ent type='ORG'>VAC</ent> to 48 <ent type='ORG'>VDC</ent> @ 10A Isolated stepdown transformers (500 watt)</p>

<p> (2) 100V PIV rectifier diode</p>

<p>Optional (2) <ent type='ORG'>Heatsinks</ent> for above</p>

<p> (2) 0-120 <ent type='ORG'>VAC</ent> @ 10A variacs (variable autotransformer)</p>

<p> (2) 80-100V @ 1000uF electrolytic capacitors</p>

<p>Optional (1 or 2) Case to hold it all in</p>

<p> (1) 25-100 <ent type='ORG'>KVDC</ent> (again, DC-10 <ent type='ORG'>MHZ</ent> preferred...) @ 100-400 uA (not necessarily variable) 50 kV isolated power supply</p>

<p> (parts list)</p>

<p> (1) 10-12 KV @ 20-30 mA neon sign transformer</p>

<p> (4) TV HV diodes - 12-14 KV PIV</p>

<p> (4) HV capacitors, 500-1000 pF @ 10 KV</p>

<p> (1) 0-120 <ent type='ORG'>VAC</ent> @ 10A variac (variable autotransformer)</p>

<p> (1) Case to put it all in</p>

<p> about 7500 feet of #16 Guage heavy Formvar magnetwire</p>

<p> alot (probably 5000 feet) of #20 or #22 magnetwire</p>

<p> some fiberglass tape</p>

<p> some plastic tape</p>

<p> TV HV corona dope</p>

<p>And, the clincher:</p>

<p> (1) <ent type='ORG'>Hollow</ent> plastic dia., about 30"-32" outside diameter, 24-26" inner
diameter, and about 4"-6" thick. It must be hollow, thermosetting plastic, with
supports for an internal coil of wire, and two holes for the wire to leave,
spaced to avoid electrical discharges. It must be boiling wax-tight,
preferrably with a gasket. And it should be openable, at least into 4 sections,
with screwholes (and gaskets if available.)</p>

<p> You also need enough of equal portions of <ent type='PERSON'>Carnubura</ent> (sp), beeswax, and
paraffin wax to fill the inside.</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________
Construction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>(1) Wind a 28" (about, must center inside the hollow part of the plastic donut)
"hoop" coil of the #16 magnetwire. (see Illustration 1)</p>

<p>(2) Wrap first with fiberglass and then plastic tape, and then dip it in TV HV
corona dope. Allow to dry.</p>

<p>(3) Place the coil inside the hollow donut.</p>

<p>(4) Seal the donut, allowing an opening for the wax to be poured into.</p>

<p>(5) Pour the wax into the donut, leaving as little air space as possible.</p>

<p>(6) Seal the donut, adding any extra wax.</p>

<p>(7) Wrap approximately one layer of the #20 or #22 guage magnetwire over the
outside of the donut.</p>

<p>(8) Coat with HV corona dope.</p>

<p>(9) You are finished with the coil. It should look similar to illustration 2.
See illustration 3 for a cutaway view.</p>

Building The Power Supplies
------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p> If you are unfamiliar with electronics, you may need some help with this
section, as I am only presenting the schematics. Here they are:</p>

<p>For both 50<ent type='ORG'>VDC</ent> power supplies:
______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<div>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________
Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p> To connect the power supplies to the coil, connect the wires leading out
of the donut (from the inner coil) to one 50 <ent type='ORG'>VDC</ent> power supply. The polarity, at
this stage, does not matter. Next, connect the leads from the outer coil to the
other 50 <ent type='ORG'>VDC</ent> power supply. Do NOT turn either of them on! Now, connect one of
the leads of the inner coil to one terminal of the 25-100 KV power supply, and connect one lead of the outer coil to the other terminal of the 25-100 KV power supply. Thats it!</p>

<p> Now, the hard part. You will have to figure out some way of modulating the
fields. This could be done through stepper motor control of the variac, or
through the insertion of a probe coil (probably just a ferrite rod wrapped with
a few hundred turns of wire) into the center of the donut hole. This would
then be modulated with whatever electromagnetic signal you'd want to impress
upon the field. Through careful experimentation, you should be able to produce
some very interesting effects, such as extreme gravity, bending of metal within
the field, spontaneous materialization of ?, etc. Note that the purpose of the
wax is to act as a molten dielectric, so don't be surprised when it starts
boiling. Thats why the donut form must be made out of thermosetting (or any
kind that doesnt melt near the temperature of boiling wax) plastic.</p>

<p> Have <ent type='GPE'>phun</ent>, and don't do anything you wouldnt want perpetuated throughout
your subjective reality!</p>
