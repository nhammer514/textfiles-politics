<xml><p>Subject: <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent>: List of Convenient Deaths
Date: 26 Mar 91 01:10:57 GMT</p>

<p>Here is the much requested list of people asso<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>ted with the <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent>
assassination whose deaths are called convenient. <ent type='ORG'>Bear</ent> in mind that
this is a terse summary of each individual's circumstances in relation
to the case. Therefore, you may not get the full appre<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>tion of why
a particular death is suspicious. An asterisk indicates that a death is
particularly suspicious. Some
These deaths were part of why <ent type='ORG'>the House Select Committee</ent> on Assassinations
investigation got started. However, they concluded that due to the highly
varied backgrounds of people involved, a proper actuarial study was not
possible.
Aside from the likelihood of x number of deaths over a period of time
of people connected with an invenstigation, there is also the trend that
the number of deaths actually increased closer to the time of these
investigations. The listing below is grouped by investigation. Note that
in 1977, for example, before the HSCA investigation kicked off, six top
<ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> offi<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>ls scheduled to appear before the HSCA died. William C. <ent type='PERSON'>Sullivan</ent>,
for example, was out hunting, when he was shot by a man with a high-powered
rifle who said he mistook <ent type='PERSON'>Sullivan</ent> for a deer. This was *not* investigated
by anyone. And so it goes.
Some of the causes of death listed appear on the surface to be natural.
Keep in mind that the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> developed methods to "make it look like an
accident". This was documented through the testimony of <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> techni<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>ns
to the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> committee who told of <ent type='ORG'>TWEP</ent> technology (Termination With
Extreme Prejudice) in 1975. These methods are designed to not be detected
in postmortem examinations. I have a couple of exerpts of declassified
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> documents to demonstrate the case. One of the techniques involves
the injection of cancer cells, heart attack inducement, as well as non-chemical techniques which require no spe<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l equipment. Based on the
strange circumstances of <ent type='PERSON'>Jack Ruby</ent>'s death in prison (he died from lung
cancer but the cancer cells were not the type that originate in the
respiratory system). <ent type='ORG'>Ruby</ent> wrote notes and spoke to several people saying
that <ent type='PERSON'>jfk</ent> was killed by a conspiracy and that he had been maneuvered into
killing <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> who was a fall guy. He claimed to have been injected with
cancer cells when treated with shots for a cold. He died just before he
was to testify in <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>. He had told congressional investigators that
he wanted to talk but he needed protection.
This list does not include the names of the many people who claimed that
their lives were threatened physically and verbally, as well as the many
people questioned by the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> who were intimidated and forced to change their
testimony to agree with the offi<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l lone-gunman version.
This list is not meant to be proof of a conspiracy. I believe a conspiracy
took place based on a plethora of circumstantial evidence, many involving
questions that are very strange if we are to believe the lone-gunman theory.
Many of the points I have raised can be rationally explained, but it is the
confluence of many aspects of the case which make me doubt the offi<ent type='ORG'>cia</ent>l
version of events more than anything else.
