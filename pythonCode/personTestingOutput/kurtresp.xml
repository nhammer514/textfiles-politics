<p> This piece is a libel against <ent type='NORP'>Neo</ent>-paganism in general and <ent type='NORP'>Dianist</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Wicca</ent>

<p>PROJECT: THE LAST GENERATION</p>

<p> THE BRAIN WASHING OF A GENERATION</p>

<p> Though this book deals with the <ent type='GPE'>Washington State</ent> educational
system, the same things are happening all over the country under
different names. For most of the school curriculum formation (writing
and <ent type='NORP'>tryed</ent> out) is done in <ent type='LOC'>the Pacific Northwest</ent> by the new age
movement for the <ent type='ORG'>National Education</ent> system As an insider, I can
explain how they have managed to go so far in government and law
making and gone undetected by the majority of the population. The
following gives some of the plans and ideas of leaders who are in the
radical reconstruction of our educational system. This book will give
an idea of how they have advanced, some of the results of their
advancement, and where the momentum seems to be taking us....</p>

<p>....This book will show the taking over of the <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> system; with
the intent of wiping-out THE <ent type='ORG'>JUDEO</ent> - CHRISTIAN VALUES. By a conspiracy
which is written of by <ent type='PERSON'>Marilyn Ferguson</ent> in the Aquarian Conspiracy and
"she has found in the deepest roots of the educational system; she
quotes "There are lot of us in the woodwork." He, a veteran
bureaucrat, was referring to a loose coalition of conspirators in
agencies and congressional staffs.</p>

<p> There continues to be no hard evidence that there is a "<ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent>
Conspiracy" infiltrating the school system! The public schools are in
sorry shape, to be sure, but these assertions of a covert "crystal
weenie" <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> out to undermine <ent type='NORP'>Judeo</ent>-Christio-Islamic values are way out
of line indeed.</p>

<p> A Parents Guide to Child's <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent></p>

<p> The 15 "warning signs" referred to in this piece range from the
innocuous to the absolutely ludicrous. First off, there are absolutely
NO curricula I know of that teach reincarnation and <ent type='ORG'>Eastern Religion</ent>.
In fact, <ent type='ORG'>Religion</ent> is usually glossed over, if discussed at all, in
Public Schools, keeping in mind the constant skirmishes over the 1st
Amendment. And if <ent type='ORG'>Religion</ent> is discussed, the thrust is usually towards
<ent type='NORP'>Judeo</ent>-Christio-Islamic monotheism if anything. In the <ent type='LOC'>South</ent>, the thrust
is even more blatantly towards <ent type='NORP'>Evangelical</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent>ity.
Even more ludicrous is the assertion that in some cases children have
to sign a "contract" not to discuss their studies with their parents.
<ent type='GPE'>Bullpuckey</ent>! The trend in education nowadays is towards MORE, not LESS
parental involvement.
.</p>

<p> The other assertions regarding teaching about the environment,
teachings about nuclear war and children's fears of it, and exploration
of children's attitudes have basis in fact. I do not think there is any
harm in children, especially older children, discussing hard issues in
class. In the era of AIDS and Crack, the hard issues of sexuality and
self-esteem NEED to be brought up. If not, there is a danger that a
whole generation will indeed be lost.</p>

<p> After a discussion of applicable laws regarding education, the tract
bounced to another, completely unrelated bugaboo....</p>

<p> On April 25, 1982, folks around the western world opened up their
newspapers and found themselves staring at a startling full-page ad.
The ad trumpeted in bold headlines that:</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>The World</ent> has had enough of <ent type='ORG'>HUNGER</ent>, INJUSTICE, WAR, IN ANSWER TO
OUR CALL FOR HELP, AS WORLD TEACHER FOR ALL HUMANITY THE CHRIST IS NOW
HERE! HUMANITY,.</p>

<p> The ad went on to say that this "Christ" has been emerging as a
spokesman quietly since 1977; that throughout history, mankind has
been guided by a group of enlightened men, the "Masters of Wisdom."
The ad claims that he is the "World Teacher," called <ent type='PERSON'>Maitreya</ent>, known
by <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent>s as the Christ, by the <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent> as the Messiah, by the
<ent type='NORP'>Buddhists</ent> as the fifth <ent type='PERSON'>Buddha</ent>, by the <ent type='NORP'>Muslims</ent> as the <ent type='PERSON'>Imam Mahdi</ent>, and
by the <ent type='NORP'>Hindus</ent> as <ent type='PERSON'>Krishna</ent>. The ad claimed that he was hidden from the
world, but that within the next two months he would speak to humanity
in a worldwide TV broadcast in which his message would be heard by all
nations telepathically in their own language.
Extraordinary News!
If these claims were true, this would be extraordinary news: a
world-shattering event. However, close examination of this material
reveals things which do not tally with the <ent type='ORG'>Biblical</ent> version of the
second coming of Christ.</p>

<p> Ok...here comes the "<ent type='PERSON'>Maitreya</ent>"/<ent type='PERSON'>Antichrist</ent> barrage. The TV appearance of
"<ent type='PERSON'>Maitreya</ent>" has been trumpeted by <ent type='PERSON'>Benjamin Creme</ent> for years and years.
The big TV broadcast didn't happen in 1982, it didn't happen in 1987
during the "<ent type='ORG'>Harmonic Convergence</ent>", and it didn't happen in May 1990,
the last time <ent type='ORG'>Creme</ent> asserted that <ent type='PERSON'>Maitreya</ent> would speak on TV.</p>

<p> If this was the <ent type='ORG'>Biblical</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Antichrist</ent>, then I'm sure he'd have his act
together a lot more than he does. And he certainly wouldn't choose an
eccentric, albeit rich old coot as his "<ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> The <ent type='ORG'>Baptist</ent>" figure.</p>

<p> The piece continues by another bounce, first into the "We Are The
World"/Hands Across <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> event (a failure) then back into Alice
<ent type='ORG'>Bailey</ent> and how she supposedly speaks for all "<ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent>" types.</p>

<div>.</div>

<p> The sinister plan that is attributed to <ent type='ORG'>Bailey</ent> to corrupt education
runs as follows:</p>

<p> 1) Children should be trained to accept a One-world global
government and culture without question.</p>

<p> This doesn't wash. If teaching kids about other cultures is training
them to accept a "One-world government" then <ent type='ORG'>the Geography and</ent> Social
Studies classes that kids experience at school are guilty as charged.
But one does not mean another. A does NOT equal B.</p>

<p> 2) Full implementation of the anti-<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> educational
philosophies of <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Dewey, but with a more eastern metaphysical
approach.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>John</ent> Dewey, although very misguided with Positivist philosophy and
Behaviorist psychology, was NOT anti-<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent>. In fact he saw religion
as a way of keeping social systems together.</p>

<p> 3) Destruction of the ideals of patriotism and national pride,
helping kids become "world citizens."</p>

<p> I don't see that...quite the opposite, I see that flag-waving, "God
bless <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>" attitude being instilled in kids at an early age.</p>

<p> 4) <ent type='NORP'>Hinduism</ent> and other pagan religions must be emphasized as
attempts are made to blend them into Western civilization.
5) <ent type='NORP'>Orthodox</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent>ity must be demeaned and declared obsolete to
the children, while lifting up the <ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent> "One World" religion.
6) The <ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent> pluralistic religion (All paths lead to God - all
religions are equally valid) will be taught as the only acceptable
belief system, excluding <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent>' unique claims.
8) Essential <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> doctrines like hell, judgement or even
heaven are to be mocked and denied. Rather, karma and reincarnation
should be taught</p>

<p> Again, like I have said, when <ent type='ORG'>Religion</ent> is spoken about in school, it is
usually in the context of the Three Great Monotheisms. In the <ent type='LOC'>South</ent>,
the ideology of <ent type='NORP'>Evangelical</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> Fundamentalism has always been
and continues to be liberally admixed in all parts of school life.</p>

<p> 7) Adolescents will be encouraged to force these doctrines on their
parents and rebel if the parents do not cooperate.
9) Permissive methods of discipline will be fostered, and concepts
such as sin and guilt are felt to be unevolved and counter-productive.</p>

<p> Rather than schools becoming less and less structured in the '80s and
the '90s, the "hickory stick" approach has made a very big comeback.
Watch the movie "Lean On Me" (which is based on a true story) and tell
me that permissiveness is on the rise.</p>

<div>.</div>

<p> 10) Children are taught that death is not an enemy to be feared or
fought off, but rather is to be embraced as part of "the Plan."
11) They are also to be taught that people who do not accept the
<ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent> teachings (ie. Bible-believers) are an evolutionary "drag" on
humanity and must either capitulate or be killed like a bacterial
infection.
12) The model of the traditional family and its sexual mores must
be discarded, and loyalty to one's family must be replaced by loyalty
to the world. It is frightening to note how many of these concepts,
first promulgated a generation ago, have become standard features of
public education, supported by our tax dollars! More and more of
these ideas are being brought in every semester! Both of the authors
of this booklet were involved in education and curriculum formation
for schools while occultists; and used our positions to indoctrinate
our charges in <ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent> values. That was years ago! Today, the "brain
trust" behind modern education reads like a Who's Who of the <ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent>.</p>

<p> I have seen NONE of this shit taught in school either when I was there
or in the materials brought back by friends' children! In fact, with
the "Just Say NO" and "DARE" programs, the <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> moral ideals of
chastity before marriage, the traditional family, and the authority of
parents are being pushed at a fever pitch.</p>

<p> <ent type='PERSON'>Dee Dickinson</ent>, the director of <ent type='ORG'>New Horizons for Learning</ent>, is a
member of President <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>White House Task Force</ent> on Innovative
Learning. She has helped put together a graduate program in <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent>
at <ent type='ORG'>Antioch University</ent> (a teachers' college!) in cooperation with the
Washington <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> Association. This course includes subjects like
astrology and tapping the human potential. A frequent lecturer at
<ent type='GPE'>Antioch</ent> is <ent type='PERSON'>Miriam Starhawk</ent>, one of the leading spokeswomen for <ent type='NORP'>Wicca</ent>
("white" [sic] witchcraft). She is a witch [sic]!</p>

<p> I am <ent type='PERSON'>SURE</ent> that for every <ent type='PERSON'>Dee Dickinson</ent> on the White House Literacy Task
Force (The real name of <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>'s "Task Force on Innovative Learning")
there are at least two Reaganbush Bible thumpers. And just because
Starhawk has lectured at <ent type='GPE'>Antioch</ent> doesn't mean that <ent type='GPE'>Antioch</ent> is a <ent type='NORP'>Pagan</ent>
institution. It might be liberal, but it certainly isn't <ent type='NORP'>Pagan</ent>.</p>

<p> III. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM.</p>

<p> The radical reconstruction of our school system (in the U.S.)
funded by our tax dollars, and the lobbying force of the N.E.A.
(<ent type='ORG'>National Education</ent> Association), and the W.E.A. (Washington <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent>
Association), will bring a new reformed <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent> to earth. (let me
build on this.) Their purpose is to educate our children to reject
differences in sex, intelligence, culture, values, ethnic systems, and
religious values. No absolutes. This translates into creating a new
government order, a new economical system, and a new religious order.
(The <ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent>) All this BEGINS in the <ent type='ORG'>RADICAL</ent> reconstruction of our
educational system. A. CONTROL THE SYSTEM.</p>

<p> What "<ent type='PERSON'>Kurt</ent>" neglects to say is that <ent type='ORG'>Parental Control</ent> movements are the
biggest trend in education. In literally hundreds of school districts,
PTAs and parents' councils are getting veto power over textbooks and
curriculae. It seems to me that schools are less and less controlled by
the N.E.A. and <ent type='ORG'>School Boards</ent> and more and more controlled by parents.</p>

<div>.</div>

<p> IV. THE FORMING OF THE NEW BABYLON (The winning of a generation)</p>

<p> The next section will help describe the curriculum change toward a
new religion and the New <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>The Heritage Institute</ent> has a
master's degree program in education which was designed in cooperation
with leaders of the Washington <ent type='ORG'>Education</ent> Association and New Horizons
for Learning(<ent type='PERSON'>Dee Dickinson</ent>). This is through <ent type='ORG'>Antioch University</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>Seattle</ent>, founded in 1975. Some courses offered include:</p>

<p> The article lists a series of classes, obviously elective in nature,
that smack of being listed out of context.</p>

<p> To briefly recap the material presented so far, I would remind you
of <ent type='ORG'>the International</ent>, National and local movements bringing in the New
Age movement to our school system through the Tri-University project,
<ent type='ORG'>BSTEP</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>National Education</ent> Association, the National Training
Laboratory, and now a masters degree program. All of these
organizations and projects involve the movement away from academics,
and the reforming our values through behavior curriculums. The plans
presented emphasize control over our educators and the students, along
with control over all curriculum to leader, economy, and religion.
The movement is very subtle, so as not to alarm the people with
massive changes, but rather through gradualism gain acceptance of
ideas while expanding them into the deeper roots of their New <ent type='GPE'>Babylon</ent>.
The taking away of <ent type='NORP'>Judeo</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> values and replacing them with
values that support the <ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent> philosophy did not happen over night.
It began in 1962 when prayer was taken out of the schools, equalling
the removal of God, and you will remember the N.E.A. Teachers Training
Manual which included the use of influence procedures for using
brainwashing techniques was published in 1962. So this has been on
going for almost 30 years now.</p>

<p> "<ent type='PERSON'>Kurt</ent>"'s agenda now shows itself up. "<ent type='PERSON'>Kurt</ent>" really objects to the fact
that even though in most cases religion is discussed exclusively in a
<ent type='NORP'>Judeo</ent>-Christio-Islamic Monotheistic context, that <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent>
indoctrination in the form of prayer in schools (where it does not
belong) is no longer allowed by <ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent> decision.</p>

<p> g. At an Edmonds school district high school we see evidence of
the culture in our area. An example comes from the hallways in Nov.
88 in the form of flyers promoting:"<ent type='PERSON'>Joey Swanson</ent> presents-Forced
Entry -- with <ent type='ORG'>COVEN</ent> plus DEATH SQUAD." ( At the Ballard V.F.W.)</p>

<p> This is obviously an advertisement flier for a <ent type='ORG'>Heavy Metal</ent> gig. Need I
say more?</p>

<p> I will conclude with a large chunk of the tract, so that you can decide
for yourself where "<ent type='PERSON'>Kurt</ent>"'s true agenda lies: that unless public
schools become indoctrination grounds for <ent type='NORP'>Evangelical</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent>
Fundamentalism, that the only other choice is for children to be taught
in Fundamentalist parochial schools. I wonder whether this whole tract
is an attempt to scare <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> parents into pulling their kids out of
school and putting them into <ent type='PERSON'>Fundie</ent> parochial schools?
M.K-H.</p>

<div>.</div>

<p> There are many teachers who still hold to the standards and values
of God who do not have <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> as their savior. They don't have the
power to overcome this movement but those who have <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> Christ as
their Lord can. These teachers must seek deliverance for their kids
from the <ent type='PERSON'>Antichrist</ent> through prayer. Some teachers help to curb the
degeneration of the next generation of kids, but I'm afraid that the
educational process is converting more and more teachers to the New
Age movement through their cleverly devised strategies. These
teachers are a generation, and will be creating a generation, for the
coming <ent type='PERSON'>Antichrist</ent> and his prophet as was foretold in <ent type='EVENT'>the Holy Bible</ent>....</p>

<p> ....Be prepared to receive ridicule if you plan to fight this movement.
Through eastern mysticism, and no <ent type='ORG'>ABSOLUTES</ent> or value system, our
society is being changed to accept the <ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent> answers. The
hysterical part of this is that the <ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent> philosophy created the
problems that they are now trying to solve. So now <ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent>rs can be
heroes in developing answers to the problems they've created.
With the only true God who gave us the social structures,
government structures, family structures, and individual standards,
the problems cease to exist when these standards are followed.
Without the structures God gave and with a value system being
destroyed by <ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent> thinking, we see the increase in alcoholism, drug
abuse, sexual immorality, all of which leads to higher divorce rates,
which leads to the breakdown of the family and the love everyone
needs. When the family unit dissolves the destructive cycle increases
and propagates itself.
In order to bring this home to you, consider the teacher in the
Tacoma School Dist. who is now offering an accredited course for
teachers through U.PS. The course is '<ent type='ORG'>Teaching for</ent> Social
Responsibility' and instructed by <ent type='PERSON'>Lee Landrud</ent>. The course is promoted
like this:</p>

<p> feel connected</p>

<p> see different viewpoints</p>

<p> think critically</p>

<p> resolve conflicts so all win</p>

<p> responsibly make decisions</p>

<p> become agents of peaceful change</p>

<p> cooperate in team learning</p>

<p> learn meditation skills....</p>

<p>....Teachers who have <ent type='PERSON'>Jesus</ent> in their lives seem to emphasize only the
positive values of God in the curriculums and de-emphasize <ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent>
philosophy. But the teachers who have no understanding of the
conflict of beliefs being fought in our society are easy targets for
deception. The educators who have already been indoctrinated and
filled with this movement's deceptions will do anything to promote and
fulfill the call upon them as agents of change for the <ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent>
movement....</p>

<div>.</div>

<p> ....The picture I have drawn seems to be so immense that it's
unstoppable. But I truly believe by turning to God and away from sin
that God will heal our land. My hope is that like <ent type='ORG'>the Kings</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>
there were good and bad Kings. When <ent type='ORG'>the Kings</ent> led the people into
rebellion against God, His judgement came upon the nation of <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>.
But when the king led the people back to God, God restored the people,
land, prosperity, and security to the nation of <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>. And sometimes
God stayed the judgement due the <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>ites while restoration and the
people were humbling themselves before God. We know that the one
world government, one world leader, one world economy, one world
religion will take place in the end times. But God may stay the
judgement against us if we continually seek Him and ask Him for our
people and our land. This may cause revival to take place which turns
our nation around, and stays the end time judgements against us....</p>

<p>....Action is needed by finding out what your children are being taught
in school and how it lines up with the word of God. Lets become
responsible for our children and their upbringing, not leaving it up
to someone else. Through this outline, I've given you information and
examples to make you aware of the plans for this generation. So above
all prayer, along with fasting to God, to make the way, clear the
path, open the minds and hearts of the educators and the children. We
hope for a change in our educational system and society, to reflect
Godly principles for the salvation of our people and land.</p>

<p> <special>end of tract</special></p>

<p> The change that "<ent type='PERSON'>Kurt</ent>" is hoping for is on its way, and it's not a very
pleasant one. Excellent teachers whose only "crime" is same-sex
orientation are still being removed from the profession. I am waiting
until someone who is <ent type='NORP'>Neo</ent>-pagan by religious belief is hounded from
their classroom by <ent type='PERSON'>Fundie</ent> witch-hunters. Forced prayer in school using
"The Lord's Prayer" or another <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> prayer might come back to
schools once the balance of the <ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent> tilts irreversably to the
Right with the ratification of Judge <ent type='PERSON'>Souter</ent> or another Religious
Rightist candidate to the seat recently vacated. The theory of
Evolution, which is as founded in scientific fact as the Three Laws of
Thermodynamics and Newton's Law of Gravity, continues to be taught,
albeit under fire from Creationist pseudo-science. But who knows how
long before even that will no longer be a part of the curriculum.
With the "back to basics" mania, it is doubtful that the <ent type='EVENT'>New Age</ent>
methods that might have found their way in a non-religious context into
the schools will remain there.
The fact of the matter is that the watered-down textbooks that result
from pressure from the Religious Right are doing damage to the learning
experience NOW. With further erosion of the <ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent>, it is
obvious that the slide will continue into a true dark age of
illiteracy and faith rather than academic excellence and knowledge.
