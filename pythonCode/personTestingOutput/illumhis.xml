Faces in the Crowd

Among the several hundred witnesses to the assassination were the
following: the "umbrella man" who supposedly signaled
assassination teams to fire by closing his black umbrella; the
"Babushka Lady," who allegedly was introduced to "Lee <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> of
the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>" by <ent type='PERSON'>Jack Ruby</ent> and who also filmed the assassination, only
to have the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> confiscate the film and never return it; Joseph
<ent type='ORG'>Milteer</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>the National</ent> States Rights Party leader who had disclosed
the <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> plot against <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent> and who had links through the <ent type='ORG'>NSRP</ent> to
<ent type='PERSON'>James</ent> Earl Ray's brother <ent type='PERSON'>Jerry</ent>; three tramps who were arrested
soon after the assassination, two of them allegedly resembling E.
Howard Hunt and <ent type='PERSON'>Frank Sturgis</ent>, the third possibly being <ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> II;
<ent type='PERSON'>Lee Harvey Oswald</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>George</ent> DeMohrenschildt who, so
DeMohrenschildt told a hospital roommate just before his death,
were together watching the parade when the shots were fired --
<ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> ran and that was the last time DeMohrenschildt supposedly
saw him.</p>

<ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> was a patsy and that the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> killed <ent type='PERSON'>Kennedy</ent> (though later
DeMohrenschildt claimed to have been the link between H.L Hunt and
<ent type='PERSON'>Oswald</ent> in a right-wing plot to kill <ent type='PERSON'>JFK</ent>). <ent type='PERSON'>Ferrie</ent> allegedly flies
