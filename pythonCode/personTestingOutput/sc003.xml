<p><ent type='PERSON'>Skolnick</ent> COMMENTARY #003
========================</p>

<p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put
out by a group in <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>

<p>Hi. <ent type='PERSON'>Sherman Skolnik</ent>, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts,
9800 Oglesby.</p>

<p>The mass media cannot tell the truth on key issues. Why? Well, in
part because of the financial hangups. Also because they are the
propaganda horn of the ruling families, who cannot level with the
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> worker. So, you are not told the story behind the story.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>1) On the future of the <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Free Trade Agreement
[NAFTA] hangs the U.S. banking system. Large, money-center banks
have loaned <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent> billions of dollars. Will they be able to pay
back? (Such as <ent type='ORG'>Bank America</ent>, once owned principally by the
Vatican and the <ent type='PERSON'>Rothschilds</ent>, and large owners now being the
<ent type='ORG'>Yakasa</ent> [sp?], the <ent type='NORP'>Japanese</ent> mafia.) Also loaning big to <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>
have been <ent type='ORG'>Chase Manhattan</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Citicorp</ent>, both owned by the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefellers</ent>, *and* Chicago's <ent type='ORG'>Continental Bank</ent>, owned by a
combination of the Vatican, the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> royals and, since 1984,
by the <ent type='ORG'>Yakasa</ent>. (Note: Financially interlocked with Continental
Bank are multi, multi-millionaire judges on Chicago's Federal
Court of Appeals, including judge <ent type='PERSON'>Xxxxxx Xxxxxxxx</ent>, a man of trust
for the <ent type='PERSON'>Pope</ent>, and judge <ent type='PERSON'>Xxxxxxx Xxxxxxx</ent> head of a trust for the
commodity gambling cartel.)</p>

<p>To preserve profits, big business needs cheap labor.</p>

<p>2) What is behind the strange death of <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> aide Vincent
<ent type='PERSON'>Foster</ent>? <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> authorities are investigating a ring of assassins
who reportedly murdered <ent type='PERSON'>Foster</ent>. The autopsy has to be doctored up
to conceal 2 bullet holes in the back of Foster's head. The press
says he was, uh.... a suicide. *Oh, yeah?*</p>

<p>As to the motives, <ent type='PERSON'>Foster</ent> and his former law partner, first lady
<ent type='PERSON'>Hillary</ent>, were being scrutinized by <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Reserve</ent> -- no
angels themselves. As part of the highly corrupt Rose [sp?] law
firm of <ent type='ORG'>Little Rock</ent>, they are accused of money laundering work in
the <ent type='LOC'>Mideast</ent> and <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Foster</ent> had an appointment with the
President. He never went to it. Sources contend <ent type='PERSON'>Foster</ent> knew about
an earth-shaking situation involving the <ent type='LOC'>Mideast</ent> and previous
presidents, like <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>. Supposedly, <ent type='PERSON'>Clinton</ent> did not know, *but*
once informed by <ent type='PERSON'>Foster</ent>, "Sludge Willy" would have had to take
action or be impeached. You can see why <ent type='PERSON'>Foster</ent> was "suicided."</p>

<p>Those on the cutting edge of <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> information realize
<ent type='PERSON'>Clinton</ent> has more "skeletons" than George <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent> *and* Clinton's
scandals overlap those of <ent type='PERSON'>Bush</ent>.</p>

<p>3) The story behind the dope business is squelched. The ultra-rich profit from the dope traffic through money-center banks. The
book *The Underground Empire* by <ent type='ORG'>Mills</ent> [C. Wright <ent type='ORG'>Mills</ent> (?)]
documents how the dope enforcement authorities and the espionage
agencies are the key players in promoting the dope business.</p>

<p>4) The U.S. military is using <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> helicopters, such as at Air
Force bases. Uh, they claim it is just for "military exercises."
*Oh, yeah?*</p>

<p>In case of a financial emergency in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, will <ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent>
mercenary troops be used to round up <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> political activists
and drag them off to remote prisons? Huh?!? (Some call them
concentration camps.)</p>

<p>And what can *you* do? Well, call up your favorite news fakers
and *demand* that they tell us the real stuff.</p>

<p>(312) 731-1100 is our main message. Donations appreciated.
