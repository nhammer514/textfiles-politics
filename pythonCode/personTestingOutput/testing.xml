<p> NUCLEAR BOMB AND WEAPONS TESTING FACTS</p>

<p>The US explodes nuclear bombs underground at the <ent type='GPE'>Nevada</ent> Test Site
(<ent type='ORG'>NTS</ent>), 65 miles northwest of <ent type='GPE'>Las Vegas</ent>. The <ent type='ORG'>NTS</ent> is 1350 square
miles in size, larger than the state of <ent type='GPE'>Rhode Island</ent>. The 1863
Treaty of <ent type='GPE'>Ruby Valley</ent> recognizes the Western <ent type='ORG'>Shoshone</ent> Nation's
right to the land.[1] Despite <ent type='ORG'>Shoshone</ent> objections, the US
Department of Energy (<ent type='ORG'>DOE</ent>) operates the <ent type='ORG'>NTS</ent> for testing nuclear
bombs and weapons.</p>

<p> Nearly 5000 persons work for the nuclear weapons testing program
in the <ent type='GPE'>Las Vegas</ent>/<ent type='ORG'>NTS</ent> areas. The research, develop-ment and
testing budget for the US in FY 1990 was nearly $2 billion.[2]
Millions of dollars are now being allocated to assess and begin
clean-up of the environmental damage at <ent type='ORG'>NTS</ent>.</p>

<p> Los Alamos Laboratory in <ent type='GPE'>New Mexico</ent> and Lawrence Livermore in
<ent type='GPE'>California</ent> design and perfect nuclear weapons for the US testing
program. Both labs are managed by <ent type='ORG'>the University</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>.
The main <ent type='ORG'>NTS</ent> contractors are EG&amp;G (Edgerton, Germeshausen &amp;
<ent type='PERSON'>Grier</ent>), its subsidiary, REECo (<ent type='PERSON'>Reynolds</ent> Electrical and Engineering
Co.), and Raytheon.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>NTS</ent> became the location for on-continent nuclear weapons testing
in 1951. Previous to that the first nuclear bomb test took place
in the atmosphere in <ent type='GPE'>New Mexico</ent>.</p>

<p> Nuclear bombs were dropped in <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> on the populations of
<ent type='GPE'>Hiroshima</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Nagasaki</ent> in 1945. Between 1946 and late-1962
atmospheric and underground nuclear tests were conducted by the US
in <ent type='GPE'>the Marshall Islands</ent>, <ent type='LOC'>Christmas Island</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Johnston</ent> Atoll in
<ent type='LOC'>the Pacific south</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Hawaii</ent>, and over <ent type='LOC'>the South Atlantic Ocean</ent>. In
addition to <ent type='GPE'>Nevada</ent>, several underground nuclear weapons tests
since 1962 have been in <ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Mississippi</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>New Mexico</ent>, &amp;
Amchitka, an <ent type='LOC'>Aleutian Island</ent> off Alaska's coast.[3]</p>

<p> Atomic veterans are those men and women in the armed forces who
were exposed to radiation from these nuclear weapons tests. Some
flew through radioactive clouds or marched to ground-zero; others
cleaned ships that had been contaminated, recovered instruments,
and/or were docked in bombing areas. <ent type='NORP'>Civilians</ent> who received
radiation doses where they live are called <ent type='GPE'>Downwinders</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>
has legislated compensation for atomic veterans, test site workers
and those <ent type='GPE'>Downwinders</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Utah</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Nevada</ent> who have been exposed to
radiation fallout from the aboveground nuclear weapons tests.
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> has not yet authorized the funds for this compensation.</p>

<p> Nuclear weapons tests are conducted within vertical shafts
hundreds of feet underground and in horizontal tunnels into
mountains. According to <ent type='ORG'>DOE</ent>, the purpose of testing nuclear bombs
is (1) to check for reliability of stockpiled weapons, (2) to test
new safety features,(3) to test new weapon designs, and (4) to
determine the effects of explosion-produced radiation on military
hardware.</p>

<p> Radiation ventings occur routinely as part of the clean-up
process after an underground nuclear weapons test. According to
<ent type='ORG'>DOE</ent> controlled ventings present no danger to human health, and no
radiation leaks occur. There is growing evidence in the
international scientific community that long-term exposure to low-level radiation results in lowered resistance to certain diseases
as well as possible genetic changes.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS</ent> TO LIMIT NUCLEAR WEAPONS TESTING</p>

<p> The Partial Test Ban Treaty (<ent type='ORG'>PTBT</ent>) of 1963 requires that all
tests be underground. Public outcry about health effects from
aboveground tests helped bring about the <ent type='ORG'>PTBT</ent>. In the prologue of
this treaty signatory nations agree to continue negotiations to
end all nuclear weapons tests.[4]</p>

<p> The Non-Proliferation Treaty (<ent type='ORG'>NPT</ent>) of 1970 requires that nuclear
nations refrain from transferring nuclear weapon devices and/or
nuclear weapons technology to non-nuclear nations. It binds non-nuclear nations from developing or obtaining nuclear weapons in
exchange for a share in the technology of the peaceful uses of
atomic energy. The <ent type='ORG'>NPT</ent> requires a commitment by the nuclear
nations to negotiate an end to the nuclear arms race. The prologue
to the <ent type='ORG'>NPT</ent> recalls the earlier <ent type='ORG'>PTBT</ent> agreement that nuclear nations
work toward discontinuing nuclear weapons testing altogether.[5]</p>

<p> In 1995, the <ent type='ORG'>NPT</ent> nations will meet to decide whether to extend
the treaty. Many of the non-nuclear nations at the <ent type='ORG'>NPT</ent> review
meetings in 1990 made the extension of the Non-Proliferation
Treaty dependent on progress being made toward an end to all
nuclear weapons testing, specifically toward a Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty.</p>

<p> The Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 (ratified in 1990), limits
the explosive power of nuclear weapons tests to 150 kilotons. (The
<ent type='GPE'>Hiroshima</ent> bomb was 12 - 15 kilotons.)</p>

<p> International efforts for a complete ban on nuclear weapons
testing culminated in an Amendment <ent type='ORG'>Conference</ent> to the <ent type='ORG'>PTBT</ent> at the
UN in January, 1991. The US and <ent type='GPE'>United Kingdom</ent> (UK) oppose a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and can veto an amendment. In
spite of this the <ent type='ORG'>Conference</ent> passed a statement to continue to
work toward an amendment. The US and UK were the sole "no" votes
in this effort to end nuclear weapons testing.</p>

<p> The Global Anti-Nuclear Alliance (GANA), an international
citizens organization has recently formed to coordinate worldwide
efforts to end nuclear weapons testing. GANA grew out of the May,
1990, International Citizens <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> for a Nuclear Test Ban in
<ent type='GPE'>Kazakhstan</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>USSR</ent>.</p>

<p> OTHER NATIONS TESTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS</p>

<p> The UK, before 1962, tested nuclear weapons in <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent> and
<ent type='LOC'>Christmas Island</ent>. Since 1962, the UK has tested weapons with the
US. In 1990, the UK/US conducted one nuclear weapons test at the
<ent type='ORG'>NTS</ent>. The UK is a signatory to both <ent type='ORG'>the Partial Test Ban Treaty</ent>
(<ent type='ORG'>PTBT</ent>) and Non-Proliferation Treaty (<ent type='ORG'>NPT</ent>).</p>

<p> The <ent type='GPE'>USSR</ent> nuclear weapons testing program, due to citizen
pressure, may be moved from <ent type='GPE'>Kazakhstan</ent> to <ent type='LOC'>Novaya Zemlya</ent> above the
<ent type='LOC'>Arctic Circle</ent>. The <ent type='GPE'>USSR</ent> has initiated moratoriums on nuclear
weapons tests and has tested only once since October, 1989. The
<ent type='GPE'>USSR</ent> has signed both the <ent type='ORG'>PTBT</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>NPT</ent>.</p>

<p> <ent type='GPE'>China</ent> tested above ground from 1964-1980. The two most recent
tests were detonated at Lop Nor in 1990. The <ent type='NORP'>Chinese</ent> will not end
nuclear weapons tests until the US and <ent type='GPE'>USSR</ent> have greatly reduced
their nuclear arsenals and stopped testing. <ent type='GPE'>China</ent> has not signed
the <ent type='ORG'>PTBT</ent>, but tests underground as that treaty requires. Recently
<ent type='GPE'>China</ent> has agreed to sign the <ent type='ORG'>NPT</ent>.</p>

<p> The <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> have conducted six nuclear weapons tests on islands
in <ent type='LOC'>the South Pacific</ent> thus far in 1991. Some South Pacific
Islanders link the end of nuclear weapons testing with their
independence from <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> recently signed the <ent type='ORG'>NPT</ent>, but has
not signed the <ent type='ORG'>PTBT</ent>.</p>
