<p><ent type='PERSON'>Kirk</ent> had introduced a new, tough Anti-Monopoly <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent> and had tried
to redistribute income from big companies to the labour force
through price regulation and a wages policy.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Kirk</ent> had also rejected plans to build a second aluminium smelter
near Dunedin and was preparing the Petroleum Amendment <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent> to
give more control over <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> oil resources.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Kirk</ent> had found out that Hunt Petroleum, drilling in the Great
South Basin, had discovered a huge resource of oil comparable in
size to the <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Sea or <ent type='NORP'>Alaskan</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent> Slope. Gas reserves alone
now estimated at 30 times bigger than <ent type='ORG'>Kapuni</ent> and oil reserves of
at least 20 billion barrels - enough for <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> to be
self-sufficient for years. Oil companies completely hushed up
these facts. To have announced a vast new oil source would
probably mean a decline in world oil prices, which would not have
allowed <ent type='ORG'>OPEC</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Onassis</ent> plans for the <ent type='NORP'>Arabs</ent> to eventuate. N.Z.
could be exploited at a later date, particularly since the <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent>
Sea operations were about to come on stream - <ent type='PERSON'>Kirk</ent> was the last to
hold out.</p>

<p>September, 1974: According to <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> sources, <ent type='PERSON'>Kirk</ent> was killed by the
<ent type='ORG'>Trilateralist</ent>s using Sodium Morphate. Rowling's first act as NZ
Prime Minister was to withdraw Kirk's Anti-Monopoly <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent> and the
Petroleum Amendment <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent>.</p>

<p>Later, <ent type='PERSON'>Rowling</ent> was to be rewarded with ambassadorship to
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>. Incidentally, the Shah of <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> was murdered the same
way as <ent type='PERSON'>Kirk</ent> on his arrival in the US.</p>

<p>6th October, 1974: <ent type='PERSON'>Ray</ent> cline implements <ent type='PERSON'>William Colby</ent> plan to oust
<ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>n Prime Minister <ent type='ORG'>Whitlam</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank finances
payoffs to <ent type='PERSON'>Malcolm Fraser</ent> and other pro-US politicians. A joint
bugging operation commences between <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and ASIA.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Rupert Murdoch</ent>, playing his part, uses his newspapers and
television network to spread lies and misinformation. <ent type='ORG'>Whitlam</ent>, as
well as refusing to waive restrictions on overseas borrowing to
finance the aluminium consortium, had plans to ensure that all
corporations were at least 50% <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>n-owned. This interfered
with the <ent type='ORG'>Seven Sisters</ent>' plans to build three oil refineries at
Cape <ent type='PERSON'>North</ent>umberland in South <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent> to exploit the Great South
Basin discovery.</p>

<p>December, 1974: <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>n Governor-General <ent type='PERSON'>John Kerr</ent> joins <ent type='PERSON'>Ray</ent>
Cline's payroll and received his first pay-off of $US200000
credited to his account number 767748 at the <ent type='GPE'>Singapore</ent> branch of
the <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank.</p>

<p>11th November, 1975: Governor-General <ent type='PERSON'>Kerr</ent> sacks the <ent type='ORG'>Whitlam</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>.</p>

<p>August 1975: <ent type='PERSON'>Rowling</ent> re-introduces unrecognisable <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent>,
designed to aid monopolisation of the NZ economy and repeals the
News Media Ownership Act, allowing more foreign ownership of NZ
media. The new legislation does not define monopoly, competition
or stipulate permissable maximum market share, or even ascertain
what the public interest is - resulting in a sell-out to big business.</p>

<p>December, 1975: Election battle between <ent type='PERSON'>Rowling</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent>. Oil
companies pour thousands of dollars into Muldoon's campaign via
<ent type='ORG'>National Bank</ent> (NZ), whose general manager <ent type='PERSON'>Mowbray</ent> is also a member
of <ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent> Foundations; Investment Board Director Tudhope also Managing
Director <ent type='ORG'>Shell Oil</ent> and Chairman <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/<ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> wins.</p>

<p>February, 1976: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> implements pre-election secret agreement
with the NZ <ent type='ORG'>Seven Sisters</ent>' oil representatives of <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/<ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent>
for helping finance the <ent type='ORG'>National Party</ent> campaign.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> removes the $3 per barrel oil levy for the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>
Refining Company, which increases the oil companies' profits by
100% at the taxpayers' expense and with all future oil prospecting licenses,
the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> has the option to take 51% of any discovery without
meeting exploration costs. This is designed to discourage further
exploration, thereby keeping the lid on <ent type='LOC'>the Great South Basin</ent>
discovery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>, new P.M. <ent type='PERSON'>Malcolm Fraser</ent> reopens uranium
mining and opens the way for takeover of mineral resources with
big tax breaks for oil exploration, coal and mining.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> returns a favour to the oil companies by arranging $US200
million loan for <ent type='ORG'>Maui Gas Development</ent> for <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/<ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent>.</p>

<p>September, 1976: With captive politicians in place in both
<ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>, the <ent type='NORP'>Internationalists</ent> can now proceed
with their strategy of takeover of the economy and exploitation of
natural resources. "In <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>, the elimination of unnecessary
competition is fundamental to a sound economy," <ent type='PERSON'>Brierly</ent> says.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Parksy</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Colby</ent> use <ent type='PERSON'>Brierly</ent>/<ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent> Investments as a vehicle to buy
into A.B. Consolidated Holdings in <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>.</p>

<p>Associate of R. <ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Pat Goodman</ent>, is appointed 'consultant' of
A'<ent type='NORP'>asian</ent> and <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Holdings.</p>

<p>November, 1976: The <ent type='NORP'>Internationalists</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>) set up a NZ money
'funnel' using Brierley's City Realties. <ent type='ORG'>National Insurance</ent> Co
acquires 33% of the stock. Largest stockholders in National
Insurance are the US Firemen's Fund
- Chairman and President Myron Du Bain also Vice Chairman of
<ent type='ORG'>American Express</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>Amex</ent>). Chairman of I.E.L. linked International
Harvester, Archie McCardell, also <ent type='ORG'>Amex</ent> Director. <ent type='ORG'>Amex</ent> linked with
<ent type='ORG'>Chase Manhattan</ent> and seven <ent type='ORG'>Sisters</ent>' <ent type='ORG'>Texaco</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Mobil</ent>. Du Bain also
Director of <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>-linked United <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> Bank, which is a partner
in Commercial <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Trust.</p>

<p>To complete the money funnel, <ent type='ORG'>National Insurance</ent> becomes a
stockholder in <ent type='ORG'>Chase Manhattan</ent>'s Chase-NBA.
Brierley's declared assets reach $100 million, with shareholder's
capital of only $2.5 million - all cash acquisitions.</p>

<p>3rd February, 1977: <ent type='PERSON'>Parksy</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Colby</ent> close down the <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>/<ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent>
Investment funnel and open up seperate channels for <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and
<ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent> will be supplied with 'laundered' funds via <ent type='GPE'>Sydney</ent>
branch of the <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank, while for Ron <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, Gerald
<ent type='PERSON'>Parsky</ent> uses Myron Du Bain, Dierctor of United <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> Bank and
also chairman and president of the US Firemen's Fund, which are
the largest stockholders in <ent type='ORG'>National Insurance</ent> (NZ). Funds to be
'laundered' via <ent type='ORG'>Chase Manhattan</ent> Bank through <ent type='ORG'>National Insurance</ent> to
City Realty and via United <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> Bank through
<ent type='ORG'>COMPAC</ent> (<ent type='LOC'>New Hebrides</ent>) to <ent type='ORG'>National Insurance</ent> and City Realties.</p>

<p>To expand the Bierley/I.E.L. 'front', <ent type='PERSON'>Parsky</ent> establishes
Industrial Equity <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> (<ent type='GPE'>Hong Kong</ent>).</p>

<p>September 1977: Brierley's new holding company begins operations -
A.B. Consolidated. H.W. <ent type='ORG'>Revell</ent> appointed Deputy Chairman and B.
Hancox General Manager, while newly-appointed directors include S.
Cushing, B. Judge, O. <ent type='PERSON'>Gunn</ent> and P. <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>, linked with <ent type='ORG'>Renouf</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Papps</ent> through I.E.L./N.Z.U.C.</p>

<p>* Strategy: To target and divide key sectors of the economy for
takeover, exploitation and monopolisation. Operations to extend to
use <ent type='GPE'>Hong Kong</ent> facility, I.E.P. <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>s to extend the
<ent type='ORG'>Khashoggi</ent>/<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Travelodge</ent> operation by taking holdings in
<ent type='ORG'>Vacation Hotels</ent> and Intercontinental Properties (<ent type='ORG'>Renouf</ent>
Chairman).</p>

<p>October, 1977: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> and JOhn <ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent> - <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/<ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent> - sign an
agreement. NZ Govt would take 24.5% holding in the Great South
Basin for $1.65 <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent>ion. Hunt would reduce his holding from 45.5%
to 27.5% and <ent type='ORG'>Arco</ent> would sell its 6.5%.</p>

<p>* Reason: Hunt did not possess the technology to pump oil from
deep water; <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> possessed the technology but did not tell Hunt.
<ent type='ORG'>Arco</ent> was not told anything and were swindled out of its 6.5% concession.</p>

<p>November, 1977: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> introduces the S.I.S Amendment <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent>,
designed to keep the economy free of obstruction and to help
uncover obstructive elements. Telephone taps, mail tampering and
other surveillance methods approved after <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> input on contents of
legislation.</p>

<p>Late 1977: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> travels to the US to meet top <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
officials, including <ent type='ORG'>Trilateralist</ent>s' Deputy Secretary of State,
<ent type='PERSON'>Warren Christopher</ent>, and <ent type='PERSON'>Richard Bolbrooke</ent>, who were in charge of
the new "South <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Desk" at the State Department established
by <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> to target exploitatin of both <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> and
<ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>. In <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> meets top <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>
officials, <ent type='PERSON'>Robert Anderson</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>Rockwell</ent> Chairman, also Director of
Kashoggi's <ent type='ORG'>Security Pacific</ent> <ent type='ORG'>National Bank</ent>) and P. Larkin (<ent type='ORG'>Rockwell</ent>
Director, also Chairman, <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Committee <ent type='ORG'>Security Pacific</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>National Bank</ent> and Director of <ent type='PERSON'>Marac</ent>).</p>

<p>April, 1978: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> sets up <ent type='ORG'>Petrocorp</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> taxpayers
pay for the exploration costs but the oil companies control all
distribution outlets. <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> blocks development of <ent type='LOC'>Maui</ent> B as
restructured supplies mean higher prices and bigger profits for
<ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/<ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent>. <ent type='LOC'>South Island</ent> gas market not developed as Great
South Basin fields closer than <ent type='ORG'>Kapuni</ent>. Plans develop for
re-opening of <ent type='ORG'>National Parks</ent> for mineral exploitation.</p>

<p>22nd July, 1978: Director of <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>n Federal Bureau of
Narcotics suspends his invetigation into the <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank after
pressure from the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>n politicians controlled by
<ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>, particularly <ent type='PERSON'>Malcolm Fraser</ent>.</p>

<p>Brierly's declared assets reach $200 million, with shareholders'
funds only $17 million.</p>

<p>May, 1979: <ent type='ORG'>Trilateral Commission</ent> secretary <ent type='PERSON'>Zbignieu Brzezinski</ent>
appoints <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> chairman of Board of Governors of IMF/<ent type='ORG'>World Bank</ent>
on orders of
David <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>. <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> would head three-man administration
committee which included Canadian Finance Minister <ent type='PERSON'>Mitchell Sharp</ent>,
key figure in the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Council</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>Trilateral Commission</ent>.
<ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>n Treasurer McMahon also involved.</p>

<p>8th June, 1979: <ent type='PERSON'>Michael Hand</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Frank Nugan</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and James
Fetcher meet in Hand's <ent type='GPE'>Sydney</ent> penthouse to discuss the
establishment of the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> organisation.</p>

<p>Mid-1979: <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> Oil using its man <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, begins operations
designed to capture key sectors of the economy. A.B Consolidated
restructured into the <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent> Group and <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent> to run operations
but with the majority of the stock held by IEL and <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> using
<ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent> companies plus dummy corporations.</p>

<p>* Strategy: To take over food and produce resources, <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and
<ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> restructured a small private company, H.W. Smith, using
<ent type='PERSON'>Cyril Smith</ent> as Chairman but with key executives Judge, <ent type='PERSON'>Collins</ent> and
McKenzie. <ent type='PERSON'>Bob Jones</ent> helps.</p>

<p>Private company used, as no <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent> Commission control, accounts
not published, no public disclosure of transactions. Bunting is
established as a shell company and the <ent type='LOC'>South Island</ent> is targeted
for asset-stripping and takeover, as well as key sectors of the
automobile industry.</p>

<p>Unlimited funds channelled through City Realties, NZUC and <ent type='PERSON'>Marac</ent>.
<ent type='ORG'>UEB</ent> extends <ent type='ORG'>Travelodge</ent> operations by buying control of
Transholdings, which has strategic holdings in <ent type='ORG'>Vacation Hotels</ent> and
Tourist <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>Fiji</ent> Holdings.</p>

<p>17th August, 1979: <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> inaugral meeting in <ent type='GPE'>Sydney</ent>
including Hand, <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>, R.<ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent>, Alan
<ent type='PERSON'>Hawkins</ent> and L.<ent type='PERSON'>Papps</ent>.</p>

<p>Key sectors of the economy would be taken over-food, using
<ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>; forestry and farming, using <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent>;
property, using <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, Hand and <ent type='PERSON'>Papps</ent>
would be responsible for banking, insurance and finance, while
<ent type='ORG'>Hand and Hawkins</ent> would be responsible for setting up new "laundry"
channels into <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>.</p>

<p>The economy would be taken over using cheap loans of less than 5%,
while consumers would pay 28%.</p>

<p>October, 1979: BP Oil begis $100 million joint venture deal with
<ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent> at Tasman.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> makes secret deal with oil companies which effectively
robs <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> taxpayers by giving <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/<ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent> the <ent type='LOC'>Maui</ent> Gas
deal. Normally the granting of drilling rights on public land is
done using a worldwide system which incorporates an auction tender
system. <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> bypassed this. Also, <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/<ent type='PERSON'>Todd</ent> pays no tax
on <ent type='ORG'>Kapuni</ent> profits, while putting funds into <ent type='LOC'>Maui</ent> development.</p>

<p>19th November, 1979: Secret meeting in <ent type='GPE'>Auckland</ent> between <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent> to transfer 43% <ent type='ORG'>Tasman Pulp and Paper</ent> held by
<ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> to Challenge <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>oration (Chairman <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent>)
and <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>s. Tasman has lucrative 75-year contract for cheap
timber signed in 1955.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> paid off with a $1 million 'non-repayable' loan - $500000
to be paid into account number 8746665 at <ent type='LOC'>New Hebrides</ent> branch of
the <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>n International Bank.</p>

<p>November, 1979: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> drops restrictions on foreign investment.
<ent type='ORG'>AMAX</ent> (Stnadard Oil of <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> subsidiary) captures the Martha
Hill goldmine.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> unveils the Government's plans (instructed by <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>)
to form <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> into an offshore production base for the
multi-national corporations as benefits include government export
incentives, stable government, cheap labour, and so on.</p>

<p>27th November, 1979: <ent type='PERSON'>Gerald Parsky</ent>'s lieutenant, <ent type='PERSON'>David Kennedy</ent>,
meets <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> to deliver $US100000 cash to <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> for
implementing the <ent type='NORP'>Internationalists</ent>' <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> Think Big plans.</p>

<p>These plans began with big contracts and guaranteed profits for
the <ent type='ORG'>Seven Sisters</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Bechtel</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Mitsubishi</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Mitsui</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Nippon Steel</ent>,
<ent type='NORP'>Internationalists</ent>' <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> banks.</p>

<p>With the experimental petroleum plant, the oil price has to be
$50/barrel to be profitable, yet Mobil's profits are guaranteed.</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Steel is to be expanded 500%, even though there was a
global steel glut of 50%.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>s own 10% of <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Steel and are majority
stockholders in <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Steel and control monopoly over wire rod,
reinforcing steel. <ent type='ORG'>Aslo</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> taxpayers subsidise
<ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>s' profits.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> introduces the National Development <ent type='PERSON'>Bill</ent> with 'fast-track'
legislation, to keep the economy 'free of obstruction' for
long-term monopolisation.</p>

<p>C.E.R. plan introduced, designed to integrate the economies of
<ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> with the <ent type='ORG'>Trilateral Commission</ent> for the
purpose of exploiting the South <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> countries and as a
'back-door' entrance into <ent type='GPE'>China</ent> - the world's largest untapped
consumer market. <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> is also the closest country to
<ent type='LOC'>Antarctica</ent>, which has a vast mineral resource for future
exploitation.</p>

<p>"Think Big" projects begin, even though <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> aware of studies
that show <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> could conserve up to 40% of energy
consumption using existing technology, which would mean funds
could be invested elsewhere to lower consumer prices, lower
inflation rates, less demand for imported oil and increased
imployment by creating new industry to manufacture and install
energy-saving technology. None of these options seriously
considered as all would lessen profits for members of the
<ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> organisations.</p>

<p>December 1979: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> unveils 'stage two' of a four-stage plan
to exploit <ent type='LOC'>the Great South Basin</ent> discovery. Plan prepared by
<ent type='ORG'>Trilateralist</ent> 'Think Tank' - the Brookings Institute.</p>

<p>'Stage Two' includes methanol plant and synthetic petrol plant,
which would initially use gas from the <ent type='LOC'>Maui</ent> field and later would
link with underwater gas pipe from <ent type='LOC'>Campbell Island</ent>.</p>

<p>With the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Steel 500% expansion, 'stage three' of the
project and Think Big contracts to go to <ent type='ORG'>Bechtel</ent>, Fluor <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>.,
<ent type='ORG'>Mitsubishi</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Mitsui</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Nippon Steel</ent>, etc. All investments would be
financed by the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> taxpayer.</p>

<p>17th January, 1980: $500000 deposited in Muldoon's account
number 8746665 at the <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>n International Bank, being the
final payment for the Tasman deal.</p>

<p>Early 1980: <ent type='GPE'>Kashoggi</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Travelodge</ent> operations extended with
affiliation agreement between <ent type='ORG'>Dominion Breweries</ent> and Western
International Hotels (Seattle First <ent type='ORG'>National Bank</ent>).</p>

<p>May, 1980: Mafia's <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent> Hand banking operation crashes after
<ent type='PERSON'>Frank Nugan</ent> killed. Death ruled as suicide even though no
fingerprints found on the rifle. <ent type='ORG'>Maloney</ent>, Houghton, Yates and
Hand shred important documents, but miss some. <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> helps Hand and
Bank President <ent type='PERSON'>Donald Beasley</ent> escape to the U.S. The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and
<ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>n Security Intelligence Organisation cover everything up.
<ent type='ORG'>Beazley</ent> appointed President of <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> City <ent type='ORG'>National Bank</ent>, run by
<ent type='PERSON'>Alberto Dugue</ent> for 'laundering' profits from the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Colombian</ent>
cocaine operation.</p>

<p>There is a probability that <ent type='PERSON'>Michael Hand</ent> killed <ent type='PERSON'>Frank Nugan</ent>
because of his involvement with Hand's fiancee.</p>

<p>25th May, 1980: <ent type='PERSON'>Colby</ent> arrived in <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent> to discuss replacement
of the <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank with Hand, <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, and <ent type='PERSON'>Seldon</ent>. Immediate
funding available from <ent type='GPE'>Sydney</ent> branch of the <ent type='ORG'>Deak Bank</ent>, a separate
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> operation, and IEL would be used to buy <ent type='ORG'>NZI</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>., to prepare
for future laundering operations.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Maloney</ent>, Houghton, Yates, and Hand would shred all documents
leading back to the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Great South Basin</ent> connection, and
the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> would help <ent type='ORG'>Hand and Bank</ent> President Donald <ent type='ORG'>Beazley</ent> escape
to the <ent type='GPE'>USA</ent>. The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>ASIO</ent> would also cover everything up.</p>

<p>Hand and <ent type='ORG'>Beazley</ent> turn up in <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> - <ent type='ORG'>Beazley</ent> appointed President
and Hand 'consultant' to the <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> City <ent type='ORG'>National Bank</ent>, but also
Hand turned up in El Salvador to help organise bankrolling of the
<ent type='NORP'>Contras</ent> with other ex-members of <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent>-Hand.</p>

<p>23rd June, 1980: <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>, including <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Jones</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Hawkins</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>, and <ent type='PERSON'>Papps</ent> meet in <ent type='GPE'>Wellington</ent> to
discuss merger of <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> Challenge and Tasman.</p>

<p>In order to replace <ent type='PERSON'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank's 22 world-wide branches,
quick moves are made to buy control of <ent type='ORG'>NZI</ent> by <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>
using <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, thereby capturing an established, world-wide
organisation through the <ent type='GPE'>Hong Kong</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Shanghai</ent> Bank, which is
also linked to the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> through its subsidiary, World Finance
<ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>oration.</p>

<p>Late 1980: <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>s, with strong <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent> links, obtains

<ent type='PERSON'>Seldon</ent> outlines strategy of merging <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>n economy with the
<ent type='ORG'>Trilateralist</ent> economy through Europe and the US.</p>

<p>In <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Council</ent> will monopolise the economy with
company takeovers through the use of loans at less than 5%.</p>

<p>Holme's A'Court's company would be taken over using Security
<ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> <ent type='ORG'>National Bank</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Chase Manhattan</ent> Bank, with some of the
stock being held in <ent type='GPE'>London</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Equiticorp</ent> will be launched using <ent type='PERSON'>Hawkins</ent>, with 50% of the stock

ownership, and will use the same laundry as Chase <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>oration -
<ent type='PERSON'>Hawkins</ent> will set up a maze of shell companies and dummy
organisations to disguise operations.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Hawkins</ent> previously associated with <ent type='GPE'>Kashoggi</ent> when <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>orate
Secretary of <ent type='PERSON'>Marac</ent>, and linked with <ent type='ORG'>Renouf</ent> through their
stockholding in <ent type='ORG'>CBA</ent> Finance, which is a partner in Commercial
<ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Trust with United <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> Bank, <ent type='PERSON'>Hawkins</ent> forms umbrella
company with Chase <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>l, Jedi Investments and Teltherm and
begins setting up a maze of cross holding companies. <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>
retains his connection through his Charter <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>oration's holding
in Teltherm.</p>

<p>January 1984: <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Elliott</ent> begin moves to monopolise the
food industry in <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralasia by merging <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent> and the Elders
Group, while <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> sells 10% of <ent type='ORG'>Watties</ent> to the NZ Dairy Board -
setting the stage for land takeover and establishment of the
<ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>orate Farm.</p>

<p>February 1984: <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> politician D. <ent type='ORG'>Lange</ent> meets <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Ray</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Cline</ent></ent> in
<ent type='GPE'>Wellington</ent> and agrees to go on the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> payroll for monthly fee
of $UA40000 paid into account number 5263161 at Commercial
<ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Trust, <ent type='LOC'>New Hebrides</ent>.</p>

<p>March 1984: <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> knighted with GCMG for keeping the economy
free of obstructions for easier takeover and exploitation.</p>

<p>24th May, 1984: Four-man <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> team co-ordinated by <ent type='PERSON'><ent type='PERSON'>Ray</ent> <ent type='PERSON'>Cline</ent></ent>
arrive in <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> to begin installation of equipment for
subliminal television advertising at five sites - <ent type='ORG'>Waiatarua</ent>, Mt
Erin, <ent type='GPE'>Kaukau</ent>, <ent type='LOC'>Sugarloaf</ent> and Obelisk.</p>

<p>Sophisticated equipment can be installed within one kilometer of
TV relay <ent type='ORG'>arrials</ent> and all linked to one <ent type='ORG'>IDAPS</ent> computer bureau in
<ent type='GPE'>Auckland</ent>.</p>

<p>Same equipment installed in <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent> August 1985; <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> September
1986; UK February 1987: <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> 1987. Also, <ent type='ORG'>Amax</ent> geoligists now
estimate <ent type='PERSON'>Martha Hill</ent> gold source could be worth up to $30 billion
on strength of high gold/tonne ore assay.</p>

<p>17th July, 1984: In <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>, subliminal advertising begins on
<ent type='ORG'>Channel Two</ent> between 6pm and midnight - hours later extended to
begin at noon. Subliminal messages prepared in the US by the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
and with <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> election imminent, tell voters to support the
<ent type='ORG'>Labour</ent> Party, the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Party and to buy <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> company
products.</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Party was formed to ensure that <ent type='PERSON'>Muldoon</ent> would lose, as
<ent type='ORG'>Big Business</ent> unhappy with controls over economy. Big campaign
contributions from <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, the oil companies and the Business
Round Table ensure a <ent type='ORG'>Labour</ent> victory.</p>

<p>Later, <ent type='ORG'>Lange</ent> agrees to repay the favour to <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> by selling the
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> holding in the Kariori Pulp Mill to <ent type='ORG'>Winstones</ent>. New
Zealand taxpayer loses $100 million.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> then becomes the arm of big business, using economic
policies provided by the Business Round Table, implemented by
Finance Minister Roger <ent type='PERSON'>Douglas</ent> and the package being sold by David
<ent type='ORG'>Lange</ent>, who also keeps up a noisy <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> directed <ent type='ORG'>ANZUS</ent> withdrawal
campaign.</p>

<p>* Reason: 1) <ent type='ORG'>ANZUS</ent> Treaty did not cover <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> requirements over
<ent type='LOC'>the Great South Basin</ent> discovery; 2) To identify any oppositin or
threats within <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> who align themselves with supposed
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> policy, <ent type='ORG'>Lange</ent> increases the <ent type='ORG'>SIS</ent> budget and strangthens
links with the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.</p>

<p>Brookings Institute are the actual designers of the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> econmomic policies provided by the Business Round Table
(NZ <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> front) and implented by the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Douglas</ent> devalues the dollar and deregulates interest rates, which
means cheaper labour, cheaper capital assets and high mortgage
rates, thereby implementing <ent type='ORG'>Big Business</ent> policy of driving farmers
off the land, establshment of the corporate farm and eventually
remove viability of small business sector, etc.</p>

<p>27th September, 1984: <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> meets at new 'safe

McConnell. <ent type='PERSON'>Daigo Miyado</ent> announces appointment of <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent> as
International Vice President of the <ent type='ORG'>Trilateral Commission</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent>
Basin Economic <ent type='ORG'>Council</ent>.</p>

<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> and the establishment of the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Centre for
Independent Studies which will be chaired by <ent type='PERSON'>Gibbs</ent>, aided by
<ent type='PERSON'>Fernyhough</ent> and controlled by <ent type='PERSON'>Cline</ent>, which will 'advise' <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent>
on privatisation.</p>

outlining plans for an expanded laundry operation which will
coincide with the launch of 'Crack' - a new addictive product
developed by <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> chemists for the world market.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Equiticorp</ent> (<ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>) will be launched with <ent type='PERSON'>Adler</ent> as Manager and a new
merchant bank using <ent type='ORG'>Eldrs</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent> and Jarden.</p>

<p>IEI will merge with <ent type='ORG'>Armco Bank</ent>, which has 20 branches in South
East <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>; <ent type='PERSON'>Ariadne</ent> will acquire <ent type='ORG'>the Bank</ent> of Queensland, and
<ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> Investments will form a cross-shareholding with <ent type='ORG'>NZI</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>
to further increase control by their <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> organisation. Other
plans include the laundering of funds directly to the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>
and <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>n <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>s and the establishment of key companies
within the economies of <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Hong Kong</ent>.</p>

<p>The first key company will control the food industry in
<ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralasia through merger of Elders, <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>s, <ent type='ORG'>Allied Mills</ent>,
<ent type='PERSON'>Fielder Gillespie</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Watties</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Allied Mills</ent> will control 30%
<ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>s, 30% Fielder, 20% <ent type='ORG'>Watties</ent> and will expand into Europe via
acquisition of Rank, Hovis McDougall (UK). <ent type='ORG'>Allied Mills</ent> will be
controlled through IEL.</p>

<p>26th October, 1984: <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Hawkins</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Lange</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Douglas</ent> meet in

<ent type='ORG'>BHP</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Chase Manhattan</ent> could then issue and buy stock to manipulate

creating inflation, and enslaving the people through debt to mafia
controlled banks.</p>

<ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralasia and the <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> using Packer and <ent type='ORG'>Bond</ent> (TV and Radio)
<ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Holme</ent>s A'<ent type='ORG'>Court</ent> (newspapers).</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Murdoch</ent> takes orders from <ent type='PERSON'>Brzezinski</ent> since his News <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent> was taken
over in 1982 by <ent type='ORG'>Chase Manhattan</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Security Pacific</ent> National
Bank.</p>

<p>At a separate meeting with <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Seldon</ent> and <ent type='PERSON'>Cline</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Parsky</ent>
outlines plan for 'key' Media <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ral<ent type='NORP'>asian</ent></ent> Holding company using

including David <ent type='PERSON'>Rockefeller</ent>, John McCloy, <ent type='PERSON'>Brzezinski</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Parsky</ent>,
<ent type='PERSON'>Simon</ent>, <ent type='PERSON'>Katherine Graham</ent>, and George <ent type='ORG'>Franklin</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='PERSON'>Brzezinski</ent> outlines plans to invade <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> using 75000 strong
mercenary army supported by US Air Force and <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> with starting
date of 8th February, 1988. An integral part of the plan Saudi
and <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>i oil tankers would fly the US flag to provoke an
<ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>ian attack so that US invasion of <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> would be 'justified'.</p>

<p>* Reason: The <ent type='ORG'>Seven Sisters</ent> wanted to exploit a secret oil field
near <ent type='PERSON'>Bandar Abbas</ent> discovered in 1976 with estimate 150 billion
barrels and also a huge gold source at <ent type='ORG'>Neyshabur</ent> discovered in
1977.</p>

<p>The <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>ian invasion would begin after the World economic system
was collapsed by the mafia controlled banks - target date 17th
January 1988. Other countries on the takeover list include:
* <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent> - for oil at <ent type='GPE'>Baisas</ent>
* <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent> - for oil at Connto
* <ent type='GPE'>Colombia</ent> - for gold at Papayan
* <ent type='GPE'>South Korea</ent> - for gold at Chunchon
* <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> - for oil in <ent type='LOC'>the Great South Basin</ent>.</p>

<p>(Obviously this part of the plan failed to happen)</p>
