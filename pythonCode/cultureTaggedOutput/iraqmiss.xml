IRAQ'S MI<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>ILES
   <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> has bought or developed an impressive array of tactical 
and medium-range ballistic missiles. These include:
  *  Al-Abid: Tested in Dec 1989 as a satellite launcher. Would 
have a range of 2000km (1250 miles) if used in a surface-to-
surface mode. It is a three-stage missile weighing 48 tons. The 
first stage has a cluster of five (Scud?) engines with a combined 
thrust of 70 tons. 
  *  Tammuz: Possibly another version (or use) of the Al-Abid. Has 
a range of 2000km (1250 miles). Was tested in Dec 1989. 
Warhead could be 500-1000 pounds.
  *  Condor-II: Developed jointly with <ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent>. It 
would have had a range of 965km (600 miles) and carried a 1000-
pound warhead, but the project was derailed by <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> diplomatic 
More : <special>Y</special>es/<special>N</special>o ?
pressure. <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>, which viewed Condor as only one of several 
programs, appears to have allowed it to drop while using much of 
the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> technology in the Fahd. 
  *  Al-Husayn: A modified version of the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Scud rocket. The 
<ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>is took three <ent type='ORG'>Scuds</ent>, removed the fuel tanks from one and cut 
them in half, then used the sections to lengthen the fuel tanks of 
the other two <ent type='ORG'>Scuds</ent> (increasing fuel from 4 to 5 tons). This gave 
them the 620km (400 mile) range to reach <ent type='GPE'>Teheran</ent>, although the 
warhead was reduced to as little as 300 pounds. [When it first 
appeared, the Al-Husayn raised questions about the INF treaty 
(which left <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Scuds</ent> in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> as legal short-range missiles). 
It was thought that the range increase had been achieved by less 
extensive modifications and that the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>s could evade the 
treaty with similar modifications. The <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> is now satisfied that the 
modifications are impossible to hide.] Reports that this missile 
used strap-on boosters are now known to have been only 
speculation on the part of Western analysts. The Al-Husayn is 
horribly inaccurate, with a CEP of (i.e. a 50% chance of landing 
within) 2000m of its target. It is strongly suspected that <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> can 
now manufacture the entire Al-Husayn. 
  *  Al-Abbas: This missile, an upgraded version of Al-Husayn built 
in <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>, has been flight tested. It has a range of 900km (560 
miles), more than enough to reach <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>. The improved range

does not bring more <ent type='NORP'>Iranian</ent> cities within striking distance, but 
does allow the missile to be launched from most of <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>, rather 
than the limited area north of Al Amarah where most Al-Husayns 
were launched. The small 250-pound warhead would be little more 
than a nuisance (beyond the city block it fell into) unless it was 
equipped with a chemical charge. It is reportedly much more 
accurate than the older Al-Husayn, with a CEP of only 300m.
  *  Fahd: Originally begun as Project 395, Fahd is a solid-fuel 
family of missiles. One variant has a range of 250km, another of 
500km+. They will eventually replace Al-Husayn.
  *  <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-300: A <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Brazil</ent>ian</ent> missile with a range of only 190 miles but a 
huge 2200-pound warhead, enough to do serious military 
damage. <ent type='GPE'>Brazil</ent> has tested the engines of this missile; <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> has 
them on order.
  *  Scud-B: A <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> free-flight bombardment missile with a range 
of 175 miles and a 2000-pound warhead. While the <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>is have 
these, they are primarily used as a source of parts and 
technology for the improved Al-Husayn. 
  *  Frog-7: A <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> artillery bombardment weapon with a range of 
only 45 miles and a payload of 1000 pounds. Huge numbers of 
an improved version (range 90km), built locally as the Laith, were 
fired at <ent type='NORP'>Iranian</ent> forces and border towns during the war. <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> is 
developing a chemical warhead for the Laith.

  *  <ent type='ORG'>Ababil</ent>: A family of artillery rockets based on the <ent type='NORP'>Yugoslav</ent> 
M87 design. There are 50km and 100km versions.
