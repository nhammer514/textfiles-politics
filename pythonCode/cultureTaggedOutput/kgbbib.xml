   OF
  BOOKS CONCERNING SOVIET STATE SECURITY
   by Charles Trew Burke, Virginia   </p>

<p> The following is a short collection of books concerning, 
either directly or indirectly, the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Committee for State 
Security (Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti, or <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>).  
 All of the books were written during the 1980's and are 
arranged alphabetically by author or editor.
 The list is not intended to be comprehensive. The list 
contains a wide range of authors. Among the group are scholars, 
government officials (active and retired), <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> bloc defectors, 
and other people in positions that afford them the ability to
provide information on the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> state security apparatus. Some 
of the works deal only with the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>. Others deal primarily 
with other topics yet, still provide insightful commentary on a 
specific topic concerning the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>. </p>

<p>   INTRODUCTION</p>

<p> During the late spring of 1989, at the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Congress of 
People's Deputies, former weight lifter Yuri Vlasov made one of 
the harshest attacks on the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Committee for State Security 
(<ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>) in recent memory. 
 Vlasov, whose father disappeared in 1953, stated live on 
<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> television: "This service sowed grief, cries, torture on 
its native land...The democratic renewal in the country has not 
changed the position of the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> in the political system." Vlasov 
also made a number of other emotional and dramatic charges during 
his speech. At the conclusion of his remarks, the hall gave him 
an extended ovation.  
 The incident is, indeed, evidence of how far political 
changes have come to the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union. A very short time ago, 
Vlasov's comments would have placed him in very serious trouble. 
Yet, Vlasov is quite correct that the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> has retained its power 
and privileged postion in the <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>US</ent>SR</ent>.
 The organization that is now the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> has undergone a 
number of reorganizations and name changes since the inception of 
the <ent type='ORG'>Cheka</ent> on December 7 (or 20), 1917. Although the organization 
was supposed to be temporary, the <ent type='ORG'>Cheka</ent> and its successors (the 
<ent type='ORG'>GPU</ent>, O<ent type='ORG'>GPU</ent>, GUGB, NKVD, N<ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>MGB</ent>, and now the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>) have remained 
a key element in the administration of internal and external 
policies of the <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>US</ent>SR</ent>. Interestingly, members of the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> still 
call themselves <ent type='ORG'>Chekists</ent> in recognition of a hallowed tradition. 
 Despite the widespread public recognition of the 
organization's existence, few, even in the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> field, 
comprehend the full role of the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> in <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> society. Most 
frequently the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> is compared to the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Central 
Intelligence Agency (<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>). However, the scope of activities 
carried out by the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> include the functions that are carried out 
in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> by at least a dozen Federal agencies.</p>

<p>    <ent type='ORG'>ANNOTATED</ent> BIBLIOGRAPHY
   OF
    BOOKS CONCERNING SOVIET STATE SECURITY
  by Charles Trew Burke, Virginia</p>

<p>Barron, John. <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> Today. <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>: Reader's Digest, 1983. 489 pp. 
 Contains photographs and index. </p>

<p> Barron, an editor at Reader's Digest, has written a number 
of articles and books on the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>. He has benefitted enormously 
from <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> cooperation on his books. His access to government 
officials and documents, and a number of <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> defectors, has 
allowed him to put together two of the best-selling works ever on 
the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> (his previous work was <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> published in 1974 by Reader's 
Digest).
 Aside from providing a wealth of information, Barron 
writes in a style that is to easy read. He dosen't get too  
technical for the non-specialist or place footnotes everywhere.  
 For this work, Barron worked extensively with Stanislav 
Levchenko, a former <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> Major who defected while on operational 
assignment in <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> in the late 1970's (Levchenko has also been 
involved in two other works that will be discussed further on). </p>

<p>Corson, William R. and Robert T. Crowley. The New <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>:
 William Morrow and Company, Inc., 1985. Contains index and 
 photographs. 560 pp.</p>

<p> Both authors are retired <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> intelligence officers. 
This work is a very well researched piece which covers many 
different periods of <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> state security.  
 The objective of the work is to present the reader a 
"fresh way of looking at the current operations and global 
strategies of the new <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>." The authors argue that the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> has 
taken on a more active role in <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> government and has 
increased its dominance in the Communist Party of the <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>US</ent>SR</ent>. </p>

<p>Dzhirkvelov, Ilya. Secret Servant. <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>: Harper &amp; Row, 
 Publishers, 1987. 398 pp. Contains index.     </p>

<p> A fascinating account by a former member of the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> who 
defected to the <ent type='LOC'>West</ent> in 1980. Dzhirkvelov, who participated in 
many "direct action" operations, is particularly interesting 
because he defected for personal reasons and remains unrepentant 
for many of his activities. He is still an admirer of Joseph 
Stalin, for example, and some of the extermination operations he 
participated in against nationalist minorities in the <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>US</ent>SR</ent> after 
WWII. A very unusual autobiography.  </p>

<p>Dziak, John J. Chekisty. Lexington, <ent type='GPE'>MA</ent>: <ent type='ORG'>Lexington Books</ent>, 1988.  
 234 pp. Contains index.     </p>

<p> A very well written historical account by a senior 
intelligence official with <ent type='ORG'>the Defense Intelligence Agency</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>DIA</ent>). 
The extensive documentation, frequently using <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> materials, 
is invaluable. The bibliography is also quite useful. 
 This hard-hitting work has many classic quotes and 
comments including the infamous comment on the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> secret 
police by Felix Dzerzhinski, its founder: "We represent in 
ourselves organized terror --- this must be said very clearly..." 
(interview with B. Rossov, "From Our <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent> Correspondent," 
Novaya Zhizhin,' June 9, 1918, p. 4). Highly recommended work.   </p>

<p>Knight, Amy W. The <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>Boston</ent>: Unwin Hyman, 1988. 348 pp. 
 Contains index.</p>

<p> An excellent scholarly work by a senior analyst with the 
Congrssional Research Service of the Library of Congress.
 The focus of the work is the politcal role of the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> in 
the government of the <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>US</ent>SR</ent>. This work is very rich in 
documentation and detail and is definately more for a specialist. 
Other readers may find the work rough going. Researchers will 
find this work invaluable and very well balanced. Highly 
recommended work.    </p>

<p>Leggett, George. The <ent type='ORG'>Cheka</ent>: Lenin's Political Police. Oxford: 
 Clarendon Press, 1981 (reprinted with corrections as 
 paperback, 1986). 514 pp. With index.</p>

<p> This piece is a masterwork of research by a <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> 
scholar. This book is one of the best works ever on the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> 
secret police, certainly on the <ent type='ORG'>Cheka</ent>. Totally comprehensive and 
"must reading" for information on the beginnings of <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> state 
security.</p>

<p>Levchenko, Stanislav. On the Wrong Side. <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>: <ent type='ORG'>Pergammon</ent>- 
 Brassey's, 1988. 244 pp.   </p>

<p> Levchenko was a member of <ent type='ORG'>the First Chief Directorate</ent> of 
the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> (Foreign Operations) working in <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>. This book is his 
autobiography and covers the early years of his life and career 
up to his defection to <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> in 1979.
 This work is very <ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent> and emotional in style. While 
telling the reader about his life and career, Levchenko 
effectively illustrates the difficuly and strains of conflicting 
loyalties and beliefs. </p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Pacepa</ent>, Ion Mihai. <ent type='ORG'>Red Horizons</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>: Regnery Gateway,  
 1987. 446 pp. With index and photographs.</p>

<p> A controversial work by a <ent type='NORP'>Romanian</ent> spymaster who defected 
to <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> in 1978. <ent type='ORG'>Pacepa</ent> had held a number of 
exteremely sensitive positions in the <ent type='NORP'>Romanian</ent> Securitate. One of 
his duties included directing the personal security of <ent type='NORP'>Romanian</ent> 
President Nicolae Ceusescu. His defection accelerated a massive 
purge being conducted in the <ent type='NORP'>Romanian</ent> Communist Party by 
President Ceusescu. <ent type='ORG'>Pacepa</ent> was debriefed by the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> on a full-
time basis for three years following his defection.
 His remarks on the turbulent <ent type='NORP'>Romanian</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> relationship 
and <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> control mechanisms over <ent type='ORG'>Warsaw Pact</ent> allies are 
insightful. 
 
  
<ent type='ORG'>Richelson</ent>, Jeffrey T. Sword and Shield. Cambridge, <ent type='GPE'>MA</ent>: Ballinger 
 Publishing Co., 1986. 279 pp.</p>

<p> The author, a professor from the <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> DC area, has 
written a number of works on intelligence matters. 
 Compared to some of the other works available on the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>, 
this work has pretty shallow research behind it. In a number of 
areas, up to 20 footnotes will be taken up using only two, maybe 
three different sources. Non-specialists may, however, find the 
work an easier read than some of the more thoroughly researched 
books.  </p>

<p>Rocca, Raymond G. and John J. Dziak. Bibliography of <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>  
 Intelligence and Security Services. Boulder, CO: <ent type='LOC'>West</ent>view 
 Press, 1985. 203 pp. With index.   </p>

<p> An indispensible tool for researching the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> and its 
cousins. The work covers other bibliographies, <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> accounts, 
Defector/First Hand accounts, <ent type='ORG'>Second Hand</ent> accounts, and 
government materials. This is another "must have" work. </p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>Rommerstein</ent>, Herbert and Stanislav Levchenko. The <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> Against 
 Main Enemy. Lexington, <ent type='GPE'>MA</ent>: <ent type='ORG'>Lexington Books</ent>, 1989. 369 pp. 
 With index.   
  
 <ent type='GPE'>Rommerstein</ent> was recently director of the Office to Counter 
<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Active Measures and Disinformation at the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> Information 
Agency. This work, by two intelligence professionals, traces the 
history of <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> intelligence operations against the Glavny   
Vrag, or Main Enemy, as the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> is called in <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> intelligence 
literature. 
 The work covers both old and new ground. The authors were 
able to successfully dig up some new information on past events 
through <ent type='ORG'>the Freedom of Information Act</ent>. The book also includes 
material on events in the late 1980's. 
 
 
Sharansky, Natan (Anatoly). Fear No Evil. <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>: Random House, 
 1988. 437 pp. Contains index and photographs.   </p>

<p> This is the memior from one of the most well-known of the 
<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> refuseniks and dissidents. Sharansky's dislike of the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> 
is matched only by the dislike of the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> toward him. The book is 
a dramatic testament from an intense, determined man.
 The work is useful because of the unique view it gives of 
some of the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>'s internal roles. Sharansky also has a very 
articulate and effective writing style.</p>

<p>Shevchenko, Arkady. Breaking With <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>: Alfred A. 
 <ent type='ORG'>Knopf</ent>, 1985. 378 pp. With index.</p>

<p> Shevchenko was serving as under Secretary-General of the 
United Nations during the 1970's when he agreed to spy for the 
United States. He later defected. 
 Because of Shevchenko's senior diplomatic position, he has 
information to provide in a number of areas. One area is <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> 
intelligence operations. Shevchenko, and most other <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> 
employees at the <ent type='ORG'>UN</ent>, had to preform duties for the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent>. Because 
of his senior position, Shevchenko had regular contact with the 
top <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> security personnel in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>. </p>

<p>Wise, David. The Spy Who Got Away. <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>: Random House, 1988. 
 288 pp. With index and photographs.</p>

<p> Wise is a journalist with a number of articles and books 
on intelligence matters to his credit. In this book Wise analyzes 
the Edward Lee Howard affair. Howard was an employee of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> 
being trained to run <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> agents in <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent>. The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> discovered that 
Howard had lied about his personal life, specifically his drug 
use and past thefts. Howard was fired and then retaliated by 
passing information to the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>s. He later made a rare <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> 
defection to the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union shortly before he was to be 
arrested by the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>.
 Wise was actually able, with <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> permission, to interview 
Howard in <ent type='GPE'>Budapest</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Hungary</ent> (around the same time <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> 
espionage journalist Phillip Knightly was allowed to interview 
Kim Philby in <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent>). Wise also reveals very interesting details 
of <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> counterintelligence operations. A good story. </p>

<p>Wright, Peter. Spy Catcher. <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>: Viking Penguin, Inc., 1987. 
 392 pp. With index and photographs. 

 The highly controversial memior from a former <ent type='GPE'>MI</ent>5 official 
that the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> government tried desperately (and 
unsuccessfully) to prevent from being published. The book is a 
treasure trove of accounts of <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>, and <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> 
intelligence operations. The intrigues and conspiricies run wild 
in this one. </p></xml>
