 Even those <ent type='ORG'>Executive Order</ent>s which have been made public tend to
  raise as many questions as they answer about what actions were
  considered and actually implemented.  On January 8, 1991, Bush signed
  <ent type='ORG'>Executive Order</ent> 12742, National Security Industrial Responsiveness,
  which ordered the rapid mobilization of resources such as food,
  energy, construction materials and civil transportation to meet
  national <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity requirements.  There was, however, no mention in
  this or any other <ent type='ORG'>EO</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>the National <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Executive Reserve</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>NDER</ent>)
  plan administered under <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>.  This plan, which had been activated
  during World War II and the Korean War, permits the federal government
  during a state of emergency to bring into government certain
  unidentified individuals.  On January 7, 1991 the "Wall Street Journal
  <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>" reported that industry and government officials were studying
  a plan which would permit the federal government to "borrow" as many
  as 50 oil company executives and put them to work streamlining the
  flow of energy in case of a prolonged engagement or disruption of
  supply.  <ent type='ORG'>Antitrust</ent> waivers were also being pursued and oil companies
  were engaged in emergency preparedness exercises with the Department
  of Energy.[5]

  Wasting the Environment
 In one case the use of <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ret powers was discovered by a watchdog
  group and revealed in the press.  In August 1990, correspondence
  passed between Colin McMillan, Assistant Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> for
  Production and Logistics and Michael Deland, Chair of <ent type='ORG'>the White House</ent>
  <ent type='ORG'>Council on Environmental Quality</ent>.  The letters responded to
  presidential and <ent type='ORG'>National Security Council</ent> directives to deal with
  increased industrial production and logistics arising from the
  situation in <ent type='LOC'>the <ent type='LOC'>Middle East</ent></ent>.  The communications revealed that the
  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> had found it necessary to request emergency waivers to U.S.
  environmental restrictions.[6]
 The agreement to waive <ent type='ORG'>the National Environmental Policy Act</ent> (1970)
  came in August.  Because of it, the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> was allowed to test new
  weapons in the western U.S., increase production of materiel and
  launch new activities at military bases without the complex public
  review normally required.  The information on the waiver was
  eventually released by the <ent type='GPE'>Boston</ent>-based <ent type='ORG'>National Toxic Campaign Fund</ent>
  (<ent type='ORG'>NTCF</ent>), an environmental group which investigates pollution on the
  nation's military bases.  It was not until January 30, 1991, five
  months after it went into effect, that the "<ent type='ORG'><ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>," acting
  on the <ent type='ORG'>NTCF</ent> information, reported that <ent type='ORG'>the White House</ent> had bypassed
  the usual legal requirement for environmental impact statements on
  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> projects.[7]  So far, no specific executive order or
  presidential finding authorizing this waiver has been discovered.
 Other environmental waivers could also have been enacted without
  the public being informed.  Under a state of national emergency, U.S.
  warships can be exempted from international conventions on
  pollution[8] and public vessels can be allowed to dispose of
  potentially infectious medical wastes into the oceans.[9]  The
  President can also suspend any of the statutory provisions regarding
  the production, testing, transportation, deployment, and disposal of
  chemical and biological warfare agents (50 <ent type='ORG'>USC</ent> <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>. 1515).  He could
  also defer destruction of up to 10 percent of lethal chemical agents
  and munitions that existed on November 8, 1985.[10]
 One <ent type='ORG'>Executive Order</ent> which was made public dealt with "<ent type='ORG'>Chemical</ent> and
  Biological Weapons Proliferation."  Signed by Bush on November 16,
  1990, <ent type='ORG'>EO</ent> 12735 leaves the impression that Bush is ordering an
  increased effort to end the proliferation of chemical and biological
  weapons.  The order states that these weapons "constitute a threat to
  national <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity and foreign policy" and declares a national
  emergency to deal with the threat.  To confront this threat, Bush
  ordered international negotiations, the imposition of controls,
  licenses, and sanctions against foreign persons and countries for
  proliferation.  Conveniently, the order grants the Secretaries of
  State and the <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent> the power to exempt the U.S. military.
 In February of 1991, the Omnibus Export Amendments Act was passed
  by <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> compatible with <ent type='ORG'>EO</ent> 12735.  It imposed sanctions on
  countries and companies developing or using chemical or biological
  weapons.  Bush signed the law, although he had rejected the identical
  measure the year before because it did not give him the executive
  power to waive all sanctions if he thought the national interest
  required it.[11]  The new bill, however, met Bush's requirements.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------

  Going Off Budget
 Although some of the powers which Bush assumed in order to conduct
  the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> War were taken openly, they received little public discussion
  or reporting by the media.
 In October, when the winds of the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> War were merely a breeze,
  Bush used his executive emergency powers to extend his budget
  authority.  This action made the 1991 fiscal budget agreement between
  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and the President one of the first U.S. casualties of the
  war.  While on one hand the deal froze arms spending through 1996, it
  also allowed Bush to put the cost of the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> War "off budget."  Thus,
  using its emergency powers, the Bush administration could:

 * incur a deficit which exceeds congressional budget authority;

 * prevent <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> from raising a point of order over the
   excessive spending;[12]

 * waive the requirement that the Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> submit
   estimates to <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> prior to deployment of a major defense
   acquisition system;

 * and exempt the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> from congressional restrictions on
   hiring private <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>ctors.[13]

 While there is no published evidence on which powers Bush actually
  invoked, the administration was able to push through the 1990 Omnibus
  Reconciliation Act.  This legislation put a cap on domestic spending,
  created a record $300 billion deficit, and undermined the Gramm-
  Rudman-Hollings Act intended to reduce the federal deficit.  Although
  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> agreed to pay for the war through supplemental appropriations
  and approved a $42.2 billion supplemental bill and a $4.8 billion
  companion "dire emergency supplemental appropriation,"[14] it
  specified that the supplemental budget should not be used to finance
  costs the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> would normally experience.[15]
 Lawrence Korb, a <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> official in the Reagan administration,
  believes that the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> has already violated the spirit of the 1990
  Omnibus Reconciliation Act.  It switched funding for the <ent type='ORG'>Patriot</ent>,
  Tomahawk, Hellfire and <ent type='ORG'>HARM</ent> missiles from its regular budget to the
  supplemental budget;  added normal wear and tear of equipment to
  supplemental appropriations;  and made supplemental requests which
  ignore a planned 25% reduction in the armed forces by 1995.[16]

  The Cost In Liberty Lost
 Under emergency circumstances, using 50 <ent type='ORG'>USC</ent> <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>. 1811, the
  President could direct the Attorney General to authorize electronic
  surveillance of aliens and <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> citizens in order to obtain
  foreign intelligence information without a court order.[17]  No
  <ent type='ORG'>Executive Order</ent> has been published which activates emergency powers to
  wiretap or to engage in counter-terrorist activity.  Nonetheless,
  there is substantial evidence that such activities have taken place.
  According to the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>-based Center for Constitutional Rights, the
  <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> launched an anti-terrorist campaign which included a broad sweep
  of Arab-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s.  Starting in August, the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> questioned, detained,
  and harassed Arab-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s in <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Ohio</ent>,
  <ent type='GPE'>Pennsylvania</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Maryland</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent>.[18]
 A <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agent asked <ent type='ORG'>the University of Connecticut</ent> for a list of all
  foreign students at the institution, along with their country of
  origin, major field of study, and the names of their academic
  advisers.  He was particularly interested in students from the Middle
  East and explained that the <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> intended to open a file on each of
  the students.  Anti-war groups have also reported several break-ins of
  their offices and many suspected electronic surveillance of their
  telephones.[19]

  Pool of Disinformation
 Emergency powers to control the means of communications in the U.S.
  in the name of national <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity were never formally declared.  There
  was no need for Bush to do so since most of the media voluntarily and
  even eagerly cooperated in their own censorship.  Reporters covering
  the Coalition forces in the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> region operated under restrictions
  imposed by the U.S. military.  They were, among other things, barred
  from traveling without a military escort, limited in their forays into
  the field to small escorted groups called "pools," and required to
  submit all reports and film to military censors for clearance.  Some
  reporters complained that the rules limited their ability to gather
  information independently, thereby obstructing informed and objective
  reporting.[20]
 Three <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> press officials in the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> region admitted to James
  LeMoyne of the "<ent type='ORG'><ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>" that they spent significant time
  analyzing reporters' stories in order to shape the coverage in the
  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>'s favor.  In the early days of the deployment, <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> press
  officers warned reporters who asked hard questions that they were seen
  as "anti-military" and that their requests for interviews with senior
  commanders and visits to the field were in jeopardy.  The military
  often staged events solely for the cameras and would stop televised
  interviews in progress when it did not like what was being portrayed.
 Although filed soon after the beginning of the war, a lawsuit
  challenging the constitutionality of press restrictions was not heard
  until after the war ended.  It was then dismissed when the judge ruled
  that since the war had ended, the issues raised had become moot.  The
  legal status of the restrictions--initially tested during the U.S.
  invasions of <ent type='GPE'>Grenada</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>--remains unsettled.

  A <ent type='ORG'>National Misfortune</ent>
 It will be years before researchers and journalists are able to
  ferret through the maze of government documents and give a full
  appraisal of the impact of the President's emergency powers on
  domestic affairs.  It is likely, however, that with a post-war
  presidential approval rating exceeding 75 percent, the domestic
  casualties will continue to mount with few objections.  Paradoxically,
  even though the U.S. public put pressure on Bush to send relief for
  the 500000 <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>i <ent type='NORP'>Kurdish</ent> refugees, it is unlikely the same outcry
  will be heard for the 37 million <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s without health insurance,
  the 32 million living in poverty, or the country's five million hungry
  children.  The U.S. may even help rebuild <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>i</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>i civilian
  infrastructures it destroyed during the war while leaving its own
  education system in decay, domestic transportation infrastructures
  crumbling, and inner city war zones uninhabitable.  And, while the
  U.S. assists <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent> in cleaning up its environmental disaster, it will
  increase pollution at home.  Indeed, as the long-dead <ent type='NORP'>Prussian</ent> field
  marshal prophesied, "a war, even the most victorious, is a national
  misfortune."
