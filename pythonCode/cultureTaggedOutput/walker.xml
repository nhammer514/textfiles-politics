<p>   The Strange Case of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker</p>

<p>General Edwin A. Walker is known to most JFK assassination buffs as
the man whom Oswald allegedly shot at in April 1963. The general's
right-wing connections are often noted, as is the fact that he was
forced out of his command by the Kennedy administration for his
political indoctrination of his troops. His activities during the
race riots in <ent type='GPE'>Oxford</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Mississippi</ent> in 1962 are also often mentioned,
when he was arrested on four federal charges including insurrection.</p>

<p>His public statement at <ent type='GPE'>Oxford</ent> was as follows:</p>

<p>  This is Edwin A. Walker. I am in <ent type='GPE'>Mississippi</ent> beside Gov. Ross
  Barnett. I call for a national protest against the conspiracy
  from within.</p>

<p>  Rally to the cause of freedom in righteous indignation, violent
  vocal protest and bitter silence under the flag of <ent type='GPE'>Mississippi</ent>
  at the use of Federal troops.</p>

<p>  This today is a disgrace to the nation in 'dire peril,' a
  disgrace beyond the capacity of anyone except its enemies.
  This is the conspiracy of the crucifixion by anti-Christ
  conspirators of <ent type='ORG'>the Supreme Court</ent> in their denial of prayer
  and their betrayal of a nation.</p>

<p>  [source <ent type='ORG'>NYT</ent>, 9/30/62]</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> ordered <ent type='ORG'>General Walker</ent> to undergo psychiatric testing.</p>

<p>The general's case is strange indeed. But another fact, not often mentioned,
makes his activities in 1961-3 even stranger. Going back to 1957, we find
him in charge of *enforcing* the desegregation order in <ent type='LOC'>Little Rock</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent>. His public statements on the matter were limited to exhorting
the public to uphold the will of the courts and desegregate peacefully.
The following article details his biography up to that time.</p>

<p>    HE GUARDS THE PEACE
   Edwin Anderson Walker</p>

<p>LITTLE ROCK, Sept. 24 -- Maj. Gen. Edwin Anderson Walker, who will be
responsible for maintaining peace in <ent type='LOC'>Little Rock</ent>, was described by staff
officers today as "tough, but fair." A tall, lean-visaged <ent type='NORP'>Texan</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'>General Walker</ent> came to <ent type='LOC'>Little Rock</ent> only seven weeks ago as commander of
the <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent> Military District. He is still a stranger to the city.
Today, <ent type='ORG'>General Walker</ent> was at his desk in a downtown office building at
7 A.M. He had not yet received formal orders to take over the <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>National Guard</ent>, but he knew what was coming. Already orders carrying
his signature were being processed for the deployment of <ent type='ORG'>National Guard</ent>
units. He will command a combined force of regulars and Federalized
Guardsmen.</p>

<p>He stands 6 feet 3 inches in height. He is a bachelor and has been
considered a prize for hostesses wherever he has been stationed.
He was born in Center Point, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, on Nov. 10, 1909.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>General Walker</ent>'s favorite expression is "check," a word he snaps to
indicate a mission has been accomplished or that he understands his
orders.</p>

<p>As a member of the <ent type='ORG'>Special Services</ent> group, he was required to be a
paratrooper. At his test, he approached a subordinate and asked:</p>

<p>"How do you put this thing on?"</p>

<p>He received a fast five-minute briefing and climbed into an airplane.
He jumped, landed safe and snapped to the test officer: "Check."</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>General Walker</ent> is a combat officer. He has seen action in World War II
and in <ent type='GPE'>Korea</ent>. He has carried out a number of unusual and hazardous
assignments, particularly during World War II.</p>

<p>He started his military career as an artillery officer after he
graduated from <ent type='LOC'>West Point</ent> in 1931. But he switched to commando
operations during the war and led a special force of <ent type='NORP'>Canadians</ent> and
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent>, in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> and in <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>.</p>

<p>This outfit, trained for airborne, amphibious, mountain and ski
operations, was called the <ent type='ORG'>Special Services</ent> Force.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>General Walker</ent> led the Third Regiment, First Special Service Force,
in its initial operation at <ent type='ORG'>Kiska</ent> during the <ent type='NORP'>Aleutians</ent> campaign. When
the commandos were transferred to the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> campaign, <ent type='ORG'>General Walker</ent>
led the first Special Service Force in tough mountain fighting up the
<ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> peninsula and at Anzio beachhead.</p>

<p>   A Surprise Landing</p>

<p>In August, 1944, his men made a surprise landing on the <ent type='ORG'>Hyeres</ent> Islands
off the <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Riviera</ent> and killed or captured a strong <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> garrison
that could have jeopardized the Seventh <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> landings on the mainland
near by.</p>

<p>With the <ent type='ORG'>Hyeres</ent> occupied, his troops rejoined the main invasion force
and moved up the <ent type='LOC'>Rhone Valley</ent>. Toward the end of the war he was detached
from the commandos and placed in command of the 417 <ent type='ORG'>Infantry Regiment</ent>,
a separate force attached to the Third <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent>. At V-E Day he was commanding
a special task unit in <ent type='GPE'>Oslo</ent>.</p>

<p>Returning to <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> in January, 1946, <ent type='ORG'>General Walker</ent> served as
assistant director of the combined arms department, Field Artillery
School, Fort Sill, Okla. He was in charge of the <ent type='NORP'>Greek</ent> desk at the
<ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> during the <ent type='NORP'>Greek</ent> civil war and made an official visit to <ent type='GPE'>Greece</ent>
and <ent type='GPE'>Turkey</ent>.</p>

<p>During the <ent type='GPE'>Korea</ent>n War, <ent type='ORG'>General Walker</ent> commanded the Seventh Regiment
of the Third Infantry Division and later was senior adviser to
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. His last assignment before coming to
<ent type='LOC'>Little Rock</ent> was as commanding general at the Twenty-fifth Artillery
Division in <ent type='GPE'>Hawaii</ent>.</p>

<p>He holds the Silver Star and the Bronze Star with oak leaf cluster.
============================================================================</p>

<p>This is the man arrested on four federal charges in <ent type='GPE'>Mississippi</ent> in 1962?</p>

<p>Those charges were:</p>

<p>  Section 111-- For assault and resisting or other opposing Federal
  officers, including marshals, in the performance of their duty.</p>

<p>  Section 372-- For conspiracy to prevent a Federal officer from
  discharging his duties.</p>

<p>  Section 2383-- For inciting or engaging in an insurrection
  against <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>.</p>

<p>  Section 2384-- For conspiracy to overthrow or oppose by force
  the execution of the laws of <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>.</p>

<p>A conspiracy is defined legally as including two or more persons.</p>

<p>On October 7, 1962, Walker posted $50000 bond and returned home to
<ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> amid 200 cheering supporters carrying signs like "Welcome
Home, <ent type='ORG'>General Walker</ent>," "Win With <ent type='ORG'>General Walker</ent>," and "President '64." </p>

<p>On January 21, 1963, a federal grand jury in <ent type='GPE'>Oxford</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Mississippi</ent> adjourned
without indicting Walker on any of the four counts against him.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>The Justice Department</ent> dismissed the charges "without prejudice" after
the grand jury failed to indict. The dismissal "without prejudice"
meant that the charges could be reinstated before the five year statute
of limitations expired.</p>

<p>Walker and his supporters then went on the offensive. On April 2, 1963,
a group called <ent type='ORG'>the Citizens <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>ional Committee</ent> filed a petition
with <ent type='ORG'>the Senate Judiciary Committee</ent> requesting an investigation of the
treatment of "<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s fearless patriot on the occasion of his
incarceration at the instigation of the Department of Justice."</p>

<p>Nine days later, on April 9, Walker was sitting at his desk at home when
the famous shooting incident occurred.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Medical Association was receiving "a volume of
letters from individual physicians" charging Dr. Charles E. <ent type='ORG'>Smith</ent>, the
<ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> psychiatrist -- who commented on Walker's mental state at the time
of the <ent type='GPE'>Oxford</ent> violence -- with unethical conduct: that he made an improper
diagnosis without a personal examination. Dr. <ent type='ORG'>Smith</ent> was cleared by the
<ent type='ORG'>AMA</ent> on July 4, 1963. He said that news stories of Walker's "reported
behavior reflects sensitivity and essentially unpredictable and seemingly
bizarre outbursts of the type often observed in individuals suffering
with paranoid mental disorder." The society had received 2500 letters
from physicians alleging unethical conduct by Dr. <ent type='ORG'>Smith</ent>. Nevertheless,
the board unanimously ruled in <ent type='ORG'>Smith</ent>'s favor.</p>

<p>Walker then took his case to court, filing a total of $23 million dollars
in libel damages against numerous media outlets alleging that they had
made "false statements" and that their "suppression of truth was motivated
by malice and a desire to hurt and harm him in his good reputation and
blacken his good name." The statements in question were that he "led a
charge of students against Federal marshals on the Ole Miss campus"
and various other statements attributing to him a very active role in leading
the insurrection such as "Walker assumed command of the crowd." A jury
in <ent type='GPE'>Fort Worth</ent> awarded an $800000 judgment against <ent type='ORG'>the Associated Press</ent>,
ruling that malice was intended.</p>

<p>The offensive was also being taken up by <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>s</ent> in <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> in an
alliance with <ent type='NORP'>Southern <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>s</ent>, who wanted to embarrass Attorney
General Robert Kennedy because of his civils rights activities. The House
Judiciary Committee voted on September 1, 1964 by a margin of 18 to 14 to
open an investigation of <ent type='ORG'>the Justice Department</ent>'s handling of cases
including, but not limited to, those of Jimmy Hoffa, Roy M. Cohn, and
former Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker. The vote among <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> and Southern
<ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>ic committee members was 16-2; that of non-<ent type='NORP'>Southern <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>s</ent>
was 2-12. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, a <ent type='GPE'>Louisiana</ent> jury awarded Walker $3 million in damages in another
one of his libel suits.</p>

<p>His luck started to turn sour however, and finally on June 12, 1967, the
Supreme Court ruled 9-0 extending the constitutional protection of
freedom of the press to libelous falsehoods about private individuals
who willingly take part in public affairs. Such protections were already in
place concerning libel against political officials, but this was a landmark
case extending the applicability to private individuals who willingly
venture into the public arena. Walker's awards were overturned.</p>

<p>Chief Justice Warren explained, "Our citizenry has a legitimate and
substantial interest in the conduct of such persons... Freedom of the
press to engage in uninhibited debate about their involvement in public
issues should be subject to derogatory criticism, even when based on
false statements."</p>

<p>Walker's name occasionally surfaced in the press after this, usually
in connection with anti-<ent type='ORG'>UN</ent> activities or in connection with the
presidential campaign of George Wallace.</p>

<p>    Right-Wing Officers Worrying <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent></p>

<p>   by Cabell Philips</p>

<p>WASHINGTON, June 17 -- The <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> is having its troubles with
right-wingers in uniform.</p>

<p>A number of officers of high and middle rank are indoctrinating their
commands and the civilian population near their bases with political
theories resembling those of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>John Birch Society</ent></ent>. They are also
holding up to criticism and ridicule some official policies of the 
United States Government.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous example of some of these officers was Maj. Gen.
Edwin A. Walker, who was officially "admonished" for his activities
by the Secretary of the <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> earlier this week.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>General Walker</ent>'s offense was in saying that a number of prominent
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent>, as well as elements of the newspaper and television industries,
were tainted with <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> ideology.</p>

<p>He did this in the course of a continuing effort that the general said
was "designed to develop an understanding of the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n military and
civil heritage, responsibility toward that heritage and the facts and
objectives of those enemies who would destroy it."</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>General Walker</ent> was the commander of the Twenty-Fourth Infantry Division
in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y at the time...</p>

<p>The problem for the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> arises out of the fact that a number of its
higher ranking officers have participated in or publically lent their
support to a variety of so-called forums, schools, and seminars,
ostensibly focused on the issues of national security. However, many of
those groups -- at least incidentally -- are preoccupied with radically
right-wing political philosophies.</p>

<p>   Stress on Anti-Communism</p>

<p>The chief ingredient of these philosophies is often a militant
anti-communism. The argument is that <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> subversion today is rife
among the schools, the churches, labor unions, Government offices, and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>In this argument, liberalism is equated with socialism and socialism with
communism. Thus it opposes most welfare legislation, many programs for
international cooperation such as foreign aid and disarmament
conferences...</p>

<p>The genesis of this program goes back to the so-called "cold war policy"
evolved by <ent type='ORG'>the National Security Council</ent> in the summer of 1958...</p>

<p>    Cold War Widened</p>

<p>President Eisenhower and his top policy leaders decreed that the "cold
war" could not be fought as a series of separate and often unrelated
actions, as with foreign aid and propaganda. Rather, it must be fought
with a concentration of all the resources of the Government and with
the full understanding and support of the civilian population. It was
decided, in particular, that the military should be used to reinforce
the "cold war" effort.</p>

<p>This was the substance of the still-classified "cold-war policy" paper
of <ent type='ORG'>the National Security Council</ent>...</p>

<p>Of the hundreds of military bases here and abroad, only a score have
become involved in these programs to the point that they have caused
alarm among the new civilian team in the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>. Officials suspect,
however, that the trend is somewhat more widespread than their reports
currently indicate. They are quietly trying to find out how widespread
it is.</p>

<p>A typical example about which they do know is a seminar labeled Project
Action.</p>

<p>This was held at the Naval <ent type='ORG'>Air</ent> Station, Wold-Chamberlain Field,
<ent type='GPE'>Minneapolis</ent>, on April 28 and 29 of this year. Capt. Robert T. Kieling
is the commanding officer of the station. He was a co-sponsor of the
program in collaboration with a committee of the <ent type='GPE'>Minneapolis</ent>-St. Paul
Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>The official announcement described the program as follows:</p>

<p>"The purpose of <ent type='ORG'>Project Action</ent> is to inspire the citizens of this area
to take an active part in the war against the danger that threatens our
freedom and <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n way of life."</p>

<p>"The program of talks and presentations by nationally-known leaders for
the cause of democracy will bring to light facts and figures concerning
the rising crime rate, juvenile delinquency, drug addiction, the general
degradation of morals, the complacent attitude toward patriotism, and
the tremendous gains the <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> conspiracy is making in this
country..."</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>The United States Naval <ent type='ORG'>Air</ent> Station</ent> is making facilities available for
the seminar at the request of the Twin Cities Council for <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n
Ideals...</p>

<p>Among the scores of letters concerning <ent type='ORG'>Project Action</ent> that reached the
<ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> in the following days was one from a newspaper editor. It said
in part:</p>

<p>"Perhaps someone can clear up for us our lack of understanding as to just
how co-sponsorship of such activities fits in with the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> mission, or
the overall military mission, for that matter. It must be admitted that
the local <ent type='ORG'>Project Action</ent> is politically partisan in a very real sense,
although the partisanship is not that of the party label type." ...</p>

<p>Among numerous other incidents that have been brought to the attention
of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Department</ent> is the "Fourth Dimensional Warfare Seminar"
held in <ent type='GPE'>Pittsburgh</ent> on April 15. Among those listed as giving "assistance
and support" to the program were Lieut. Gen. Ridgely Gaither, Commanding
General, Second <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent>, and Maj. Gen. Ralph C. Cooper, Commanding General
of the Twenty-First <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> Corps, and their respective staffs...</p>

<p>"This sort of thing, if carried far enough among susceptible people,
can breed a wave of vigilantism and witch-hunting," one <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> official
said. "Even Mr. Hoover of the F.B.I., whom nobody would call 'soft on
communism,' deplores these self-appointed counter-spies." ...</p>

<p>Reinforcing his point, he took from his desk a memorandum from Secretary
of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Robert S. McNamara, which has been circulated as "guidance"
throughout the services. In part, it said:</p>

<p>"After the President has taken a position, has established a policy, or
after appropriate officials in <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Department</ent> have established a
policy, I expect that no member of the department, either civilian or
military, will discuss that policy other than in a way to support it
before the public." ...</p>

<p>  McNamara Refuses to Identify Individual Censors in <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent></p>

<p>  But He Gives Senators a List of Security Staff --
  Thurmond Voices Criticism of Policy on Anti-Red Speeches</p>

<p>WASHINGTON, Sept. 7 -- <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Secretary Robert S. McNamara refused today
to give the name of the person in the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> immediately responsible
for deleting anti-<ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> statements from speeches by an <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> general.</p>

<p>He did provide a roster of the twelve-man security and review staff,
which clears speeches. But he declined to identify particular individuals
in the section who had made specific deletions.</p>

<p>The demand for this information was made by Senator Strom Thurmond,
<ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>South Carolina</ent>, at the close of hearings before the Senate
Armed Services Committee on his resolution for a full investigation of
charges that military officers have been "muzzled." ...</p>

<p>It was also learned today that Gen. Edwin A. Walker, deposed last spring
from his command in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> because of the nature of his troop
indoctrination program, had pleaded the military equivalent of the Fifth
Amendment's guarantee against self-incrimination during the investigation
of his case by the <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> Inspector General...</p>

<p>The entire transcript of the proceedings involving <ent type='ORG'>General Walker</ent>, which
runs to more than 900 pages, is in the process of being declassified by
the Department of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>...</p>

<p>Senator Thurmond's inquiry today related to a speech prepared for delivery
last March by Gen. Arthur G. Trudeau, Chief of <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> Research. In
testimony today it was indicated that the excisions had the effect of
softening the general's blunt criticism of <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> policies and tactics.</p>

<p>Mr. McNamara said that the justifications for the changes was that
negotiations were then going on with the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent>s</ent> for release of the
downed RB-47. It was regarded as impolitic at the time, he explained,
to provoke the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent>s</ent> unnecessarily...</p>

<p> Attacks Birch Society and 'Minutemen' at a <ent type='ORG'>Party</ent> Dinner in <ent type='GPE'>Los</ent> Angeles</p>

<p>    Spread of Fear Scored</p>

<p> President Says Real Threat Comes From Without, Not Within</p>

<p>by Tom Wicker</p>

<p>LOS <ent type='GPE'>ANGELES</ent>, Nov. 18-- President Kennedy spoke out tonight against the
right-wing <ent type='ORG'>John Birch Society</ent> and the so-called Minutemen in a speech
at a <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>ic <ent type='ORG'>Party</ent> dinner here.</p>

<p>The President mentioned neither group by name but left no doubt whom he
meant.</p>

<p>  [In <ent type='GPE'>Atlanta</ent>, Senator Barry Goldwater, <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>, attacked
  the "radicals in the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>." At a news conference, he called
  President Kennedy the "wagon master" who is "riding on the left
  wheel all the time."]</p>

<p>The President, in his talk at the <ent type='ORG'>Hollywood Palladium</ent>, also made his
first public response to Edward M. <ent type='ORG'>Dealey</ent>, publisher of the <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>
Morning News. Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Dealey</ent> attacked the President at a <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>
luncheon for "riding Caroline's tricycle" instead of being "a man on
horseback."</p>

<p>    Some '<ent type='ORG'>Escape Responsibility</ent>'</p>

<p>"There have always been those fringes of our society who have sought to
escape their own responsibility by finding a simple solution, an appealing
slogan or a convenient scapegoat," Mr. Kennedy said.</p>

<p>Now, he continued, "men who are unwilling to face up to the danger from
without are convinced that the real danger comes from within."</p>

<p>"They look suspiciously at their neighbors and their leaders," he declared.
"They call for a 'man on horseback' because they do not trust the people.
They find treason in our finest churches, in our highest court, and even
in the treatment of our water."</p>

<p>"They equate the <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>ic <ent type='ORG'>Party</ent> with the welfare state, the welfare
state with socialism, and socialism with communism. They object quite
rightly to politics' intruding on the military -- but they are anxious
for the military to engage in politics." ...</p>

<p>Mr. Kennedy chose a region in which <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>John Birch Society</ent></ent> has some of
its strongest support to make his third and sharpest attack on what he
called tonight "the discordant voices of extremism."</p>

<p>In the first two speeches, at Chapel Hill, N. C., and <ent type='GPE'>Seattle</ent>, he also
warned against left-wing and pacifist extremists. His remarks tonight
were directed to far-right groups and individuals.</p>

<p>The reference to "armed bands of civilian guerillas" appeared to be
directed at the Minutemen, individual groups of which are being
organized and armed in some parts of the country. The organization
is reputed to be particularly strong in <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>Los</ent> Angeles is regarded as almost the heartland of <ent type='ORG'>the Birch Society</ent>.
Two <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> Representatives from its urban districts, John H.
Rousselot and Edgar W. Hiestland, are avowed members. ...</p>

<p>LOS <ent type='GPE'>ANGELES</ent>, Nov. 18-- Raucous picketing took place outside the Hollywood
Palladium where President Kennedy spoke.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour, 3000 persons paraded, carrying signs and chanting
and singing their protests over a variety of issues.</p>

<p>The demonstration, which started rather mildly five hours before the
President spoke, was suddenly stepped up by an apparent influx of
rightists.</p>

<p>Some of the signs carried by men and women wearing red, white, and blue
paper hats, read: "Unmuzzle the Military," "Clean Up the State

<p>The marchers sporadically chanted "Test the Bomb," and, "No Aid to Tito."
They sang, among other things, "God Bless <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>" and "The Battle Hymn
of the Republic."</p>

<p>A much smaller contingent of pacifist marchers was elbowed out. Most of

<p>   Eisenhower Says Officers Should Stay Out of Politics</p>

<p>   Assails Extremists In TV Interview</p>

<p>Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower last night urged officers of the
armed services to shun partisan politics.</p>

<p>Speaking as a General of the <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent>, he declared it was "bad practice --
very bad" for an officer, even when testifying under oath before a
committee of <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, to express opinions "on political matters or
economic matters that are contrary to the President's." ...</p>

<p>The former President was blunt in discussing the recent "rise of
extremists" in the country.</p>

<p>"I don't think <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> needs super-patriots," he declared.
"We need patriotism, honestly practiced by all of us, and we don't
need these people that are more patriotic than you or anybody else."</p>
