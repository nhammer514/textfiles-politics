<p>Skolnick COMMENTARY #015
========================</p>

<p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve 
either all or portions of the following.]</p>

<p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put 
out by a group in <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up 
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>

<p>Hi! Sherman Skolnick, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts 
[<ent type='ORG'>CCCC</ent>], 9800 South Oglesby.</p>

<p>&gt;From the time of Clinton's election as President on -- strange 
events with <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.</p>

<p>About the time of Clinton's November '92 election a British 
Intelligence operative assisting <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> was murdered, together with 
all his family members, in southern <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>. That was Ian 
Stewart-Sparrow(sp?) -- having inside knowledge about the 
"October Surprise" treason, the <ent type='ORG'>Mena</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent> airport dope and 
gun smuggling implicating Clinton as Governor, and much more.</p>

<p>Right after Clinton was inaugurated, two <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> officials were 
murdered and three seriously wounded right on the road leading 
into <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> headquarters -- apparently part of a fight between <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> 
faction one: George Bush and his gang, and faction two: Naval 
Intelligence assassins.</p>

<p>And where does Clinton fit in, huh?</p>

<p>Right before the election some 15 [persons] were arrested -- 
charged with shipping exotic military items without export 
licenses to known terrorists. Among the defendants, Diane 
Lewis(sp?), a crony of first lady Hillary of <ent type='GPE'>Park Ridge</ent>, a 
northwest <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> suburb. The trial was right after inauguration 
day. Ms. Lewis was released after her defense attorney told the 
judge, in chambers, she was with <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> *and* a pal of Hillary.</p>

<p>Then, the strange events in <ent type='GPE'>Waco</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, right near a <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> 
brainwashing facility. Some believe some of the <ent type='NORP'>Branch Davidian</ent> 
leaders knew too much. A <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and military "delta team" murdered 
many while tanks with flame shooters burned down the compound. In 
the assault on the building two federal agents, previously 
Clinton's campaign bodyguards, were murdered -- now get this -- 
*by their fellow agents*.</p>

<p>On July 17th, '93, President Clinton and/or someone in the White 
House acting with them (such as Vincent Foster, jr.) stopped a 
genuine <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> plot to assassinate <ent type='NORP'>Iraqi</ent> strongman Saddam Hussein. 
Two days later, <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> director Sessions was "sacked," on flimsy 
excuses, to block his investigation of President Clinton's 
treasonous activities -- such as having military officers 
assigned to <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> acting as <ent type='ORG'>Justice Department</ent> prosecutors pursuing 
political activist civilians!</p>

<p>The next day, <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> aide Foster was found murdered in a 
lower level of <ent type='ORG'>the White House</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>The Secret Service</ent> removed the 
body and planted it in a national park in <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent>. The 
circumstances, however, were designed by someone to put Clinton 
in a "catch-22" position. If Clinton revealed the details, some 
of it, somehow, might point to Foster's law partner and lover -- 
Hillary. Did she want *him* dead to save herself from prison, 
huh?</p>

<p>Some $47 million is missing from a federally insured S&amp;L in 
<ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent>. Hillary and Foster were implicated in what seems to be 
a bank embezzlement. Federal authorities are also investigating 
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> money-laundering deals reportedly also implicating Hillary 
and Foster.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>The Secret Service</ent> is holding clandestine meetings across the 
nation about Foster, "picking the brains" of assassination 
experts. <ent type='ORG'>The Secret Service</ent> contends three foreign intelligence 
agents, disguised as known <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> visitors, got into the 
<ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> and "wiped out" Foster. {1}. <ent type='ORG'>The Secret Service</ent> also 
claims a Foster "double" left <ent type='ORG'>the White House</ent> that afternoon -- 
all to confuse matters.</p>

<p>Clinton is stonewalling release of pertinent records. Some claim 
the series of mysteries somehow involve the role of Bill and 
Hillary as <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> assets since an early age.</p>

<p>And then there's the Rick <ent type='ORG'>Ames</ent> spy mess at <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> which Clinton set 
on for a year. {2}.</p>

<p>--------------------------<special> Notes </special>----------------------------
{1} According to a *<ent type='ORG'>Wall Street Journal</ent>* article dated March 10, 
1994 ("Who is Patsy Thomasson?"), there has been lax security at 
<ent type='ORG'>the White House</ent>, apparently due to poor overall management.
{2} Again from the *<ent type='ORG'>Wall Street Journal</ent>* of March 10, 1994 ("The 
<ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s War on Drugs"), regarding the <ent type='ORG'>Ames</ent> spy case, 
"some key questions have gone unasked." <ent type='ORG'>Ames</ent> reportedly was 
involved with the <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> in narco-trafficking. The amount of cash 
allegedly paid to <ent type='ORG'>Ames</ent> was "far more than in most treason-for- 
money cases."
