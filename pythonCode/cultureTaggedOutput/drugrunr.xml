<ent type='NORP'>CONTRAS</ent> USED COCAINE TO BUY ARMS
BY VINCE BIELSKI and <ent type='GPE'>DENNIS</ent> BERNSTEIN</p>

<p>   WASHINGTON--Senator John Kerry (D-Mass) and his staff said recently
they are "confident" that money from the sale of narcotics helped finance
the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent> and that the arms network set up by Lt. Col. Oliver <ent type='LOC'>North</ent> could
be involved.</p>

<p>  <ent type='LOC'>North</ent> was fired from the staff of <ent type='ORG'>the National Security Council</ent> by
President Reagan this week after the <ent type='ORG'>Administration</ent> discovered that <ent type='LOC'>North</ent>
arranged for the transfer $30 million from the sale of arms to <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> to
<ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> bank accounts controlled by the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent>.</p>

<p>   "I'm confident that the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent> have received drug money. They have
received illegal shipments of weapons and that U.S. officials knew of it,"
Kerry said, in calling for a special prosecutor to look into these other
allegations.</p>

<p>   John Weiner, a Kerry aide, said while congressional investigators do
not know if <ent type='LOC'>North</ent> was directly involved, they do have evidence linking the
"<ent type='LOC'>North</ent> network" to the cocaine-arms operation. According to a report
produced by Kerry's staff, <ent type='LOC'>North</ent> established a network, involving retired
<ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> Gen. John Singlaub, U.S. mercenaries and <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>n</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent>, to provide
arms to the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent> during the two-year congressional ban on U.S. support.
After the downing of the C-123 cargo plane over <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Administration</ent>
officials also acknowledged that <ent type='LOC'>North</ent> set up the private arms operation to
the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent>.</p>

<p>   Weiner and several other sources charge that individuals involved in
the network traffic in cocaine to help buy weapons for the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent>.</p>

<p>  "We have received a variety of allegations about drug connections to
the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent> and to parts of the <ent type='LOC'>North</ent> network. As to whether Oliver <ent type='LOC'>North</ent>
was directly involved in that I can't say. But parts of the <ent type='LOC'>North</ent> network
allegedly were. And that needs to be looked at very seriously," he said.</p>

<p>  <ent type='ORG'>The Senate Foreign Relations</ent> committee is expected to investigate
these charges when <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> reconvenes in January.</p>

<p>   The role that cocaine played in funding the network has been part of a
two-year investigation carried out by <ent type='ORG'>the Christic Institute</ent>, a <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>-
based law firm. Dan Sheehan, the attorney directing the investigation, said
the proceeds from the sale of cocaine has been "one significant source of
funding for the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent>. He said he has subsantial evidence to prove that
the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent> and their <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>n</ent>-American supporters are smuggling one ton of
cocaine into <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> each week.</p>

<p>  The Drug Enforcement <ent type='ORG'>Administration</ent> estimates that one ton of cocaine
has a street value of between $26 and $50 million. Sheehan said a portion
the profits are used to purchase weapons.</p>

<p>   The cocaine ring, involving mostly major <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Columbia</ent>n</ent> cocaine trafficker,
or "cocaine lords," and <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>n</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent> from <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> had been operating for
years before the <ent type='LOC'>North</ent> network began in 1984. John <ent type='ORG'>Mattes</ent>, an attorney for
one of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>n</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent> involved in the <ent type='LOC'>North</ent> network, said that the
cocaine traffickers and the arms network "got together as a marriage of
convenience."</p>

<p>   "The <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Columbia</ent>n</ent>s saw that the <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> base in <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent> was an ideal
transhipment point. Their planes would land there and refuel. They also
benefit from the pilots, planes and intelligence information which the arms
suppliers had and which they make extensive use of," <ent type='ORG'>Mattes</ent> said. In
return, <ent type='ORG'>Mattes</ent> said the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Columbia</ent>n</ent>s paid the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent> $10000 to $25000 for
each plane carry cocaine which landed in <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent> for refueling. The
Christic Institute's allegations are all contained in a civil suit filed in
May 1986 in U.S. District Court in <ent type='LOC'>the Southern District</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>.</p>

<p>   The suit is brought by two U.S. journalists, Martha Honey and Tony
Avirgan, who charge that the cocaine/arms conspiracy was responsible for
the May 1984 assassination attempt on <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> leader Eden Pastora in La
Penca, <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>. The journalists are sueing for personal injuries they
suffered resulting from a bomb explosion at a press conference which killed
8 people and injured Pastora. "As amazing as it sounds," Sheehan said, "the
conspiracy is continuing to bring about one ton or 1000 kilos of cocaine
into <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> each week." Jesus Garcia, a former corrections
officer in <ent type='GPE'>Dade County</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>, said he was actively involved in the
cocaine-arms operation.</p>

<p>   He is one of Sheehan and Kerry's main sources of information. In a
telephone interview from prison, where Garcia is no serving a three-year
term for possession of a firearm, he said "it is common knowledge here in
<ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> that that this whole <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> operation in <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent> was paid for with
cocaine. Everyone involved knows it. I actually saw the cocaine and the
weapons together under one roof, weapons that I helped ship to <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>."
In May of 1983, according to the suit, two <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>n</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent>, Rene <ent type='ORG'>Corbo</ent> and
Felipe Vidal joined forces with John <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent>, a U.S. citizen who owns 1750
acres of land in northern <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>, "to recruit, train, finance (and)
arm" a <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>n</ent>-American mercenary force to attack <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>.</p>

<p>   To finance the mercenary force, the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>n</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent> and others
made arrangements with two known <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Columbia</ent>n</ent> cocaine trafficers, Pablo
Escobar and Jorge Ochoa, "to provide hundreds of pounds of cocaine on a
regular basis," according to the suit. Garcia said that individuals
involved in the arms supply operation told him that Ochoa was supplying
cocaine to the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent>.</p>

<p>   The cocaine was flown from <ent type='GPE'>Columbia</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent>'s ranch, Sheehan said,
where the planes would refuel. Sheehan said he has obtained records of
<ent type='ORG'>Corbo</ent> buying huge gasoline tanks in <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent> which are used for refueling
the planes. <ent type='ORG'>The Christic Institute</ent> learned about the cocaine shipments from
members of <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>n Rural Guard, workers on <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent>'s land who unloaded the
illegal substance from the small planes, and the pilots who transported the
cocaine.</p>

<p>   <ent type='ORG'>Corbo</ent> and Vidal belong to the <ent type='ORG'>Brigade</ent> 2506, an anti-Castro group in
<ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> whose members were recruited and hired by the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> to fight in the Bay
of Pigs invasion agaisnt <ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>. Kerry's staff report charges that "<ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent>...
has been identified by a wide range of sources, including Eden Pastora,
mercenaries, <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>n officials, and <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> supporters as "deeply
involved with military support for the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent>...and has been identified by
a wide-range of sources...as a <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> or <ent type='ORG'>NSC</ent> liaison to the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent>."</p>

<p>   According to Steven Carr and Peter Glibbery, two mercenaries based on
land operated by <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent> who were captured by the <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>n Rural Guard in
1985, <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent> introduced himself to them as "the chief liaison for the FDN
(<ent type='ORG'>National Democratic Force</ent>) and the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>." <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent> received $10000 a month
from the <ent type='ORG'>NSC</ent>, according to the report. The <ent type='ORG'>NSC</ent> denies having made payments
to <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent>.</p>

<p>   <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent> has denied that he is assisting the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent> and that he is
working for the U.S. government.</p>

<p>   Sheehan said that the cocaine is flown from the land operated by <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent>
to <ent type='GPE'>Memphis</ent> and then to <ent type='GPE'>Denver</ent>. The drug is also packed into container ships
at the <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>n port of Limon and transported to <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent> and
<ent type='GPE'>San Francisco</ent>.</p>

<p>   Francisco <ent type='NORP'>Chanes</ent>, a <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>n</ent>-American, is the major importer and
distributor of the cocaine coming in from <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>, according to the
suit. Sheehan said he learned of <ent type='NORP'>Chanes</ent>' role from Drug Enforcement
<ent type='ORG'>Administration</ent> agents who investigated <ent type='NORP'>Chanes</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Corbo</ent> and Vidal.</p>

<p>   During a January 1986 interview with <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> agents, Garcia said he told
the agents that <ent type='NORP'>Chanes</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Corbo</ent> were also involved in the <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> supply
operation.</p>

<p>   Garcia said the agents responded by saying that <ent type='NORP'>Chanes</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Corbo</ent> were
already the subjects of a <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> narcotics trafficing investigation. <ent type='ORG'>Mattes</ent>,
Garcia's attorney who was present at the interview, said he also heard the
agents say that the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> was investigating <ent type='NORP'>Chanes</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Corbo</ent>.</p>

<p>   Sheehan said money from the sale of cocaine is deposited in one bank
in <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> and two in <ent type='LOC'>Central America</ent> and then withdrawn to purchase weapons
and explosives.</p>

<p>   Garcia said he was personally involved in a March 1985 shipment of 6
tons of arms to <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent> from <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent>. In July 1986, an official from the
U.S. Attorney's office in <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> confirmed to the <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> Herald that "we now
believe there were some weapons" illegally shipped to the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent> by their
U.S. supporters from <ent type='ORG'>the Fort Lauderdale International</ent> airport in 1985.</p>

<p>   Garcia said he saw both these weapons and three kilograms of cocaine
stored at the home of <ent type='NORP'>Chanes</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> in the company of <ent type='NORP'>Chanes</ent> and Carr.</p>

<p>   "They cocaine was kept in a dresser, about ten feet away from the
weapons. Carr told me that the three keys (kilograms) was what was left
from a larger shipment," Garcia said.[EP</p>

<p>   He said he had no direct evidence that the weapons in <ent type='NORP'>Chanes</ent>' home
were purchased with the proceeds from the sale of cocaine. He said that
Carr told him that the three kilograms were part of a larger shipment of
cocaine brought to <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> from <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent> in container ships
belonging <ent type='ORG'>Ocean Hunter</ent>, a seafood importing company owned by <ent type='NORP'>Chanes</ent>.</p>

<p>   Garcia said he helped load the weapons into a van which were then
taken to the aiport in <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent>. Glibbery said he witnessed the arrival of
these weapons on airstrips located on land operated by <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>,
according to the Kerry report.</p>

<p>   The suit also names Theodore <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent>, former <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> associate deputy
director for world wide covert operations, and retired <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> Gen. John
Singlaub as the main weapons suppliers.</p>

<p>  According to the suit, <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> "knowingly accept(ed) the proceeds
from illegal sales of narcotics in payment for illegal arms shipments."
Singlaub has made "admissions to various reporters that he has sent guns
and bullets to the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent>," according to the report.</p>
