<p>   HELP BUNGLED AND DISORGANIZED</p>

<p>    By Martin Mann and George Nicholas
    Exclusive to The SPOTLIGHT</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, DC -- One after another, two violent, cataclysmic disasters
struck <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> in the fall of 1989.  Hurricane Hugo roared
through the Virgin Islands, <ent type='GPE'>Puerto Rico</ent> and the <ent type='GPE'>Carolinas</ent> in September.
Within weeks, northern <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> was shaken by the <ent type='GPE'>Loma Prieta</ent> earthquake
that left hundreds of thousands of victims and billions of dollars in
damage in its wake.</p>

<p>   Having spent "over $25 billion on setting up <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>," <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> taxpayers
were entitled to expect "quick and efficient help" from it in the face of
such shattering calamities.  But the response by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>) to these upheavals was "bungled" and
"disorganized," says Ray Groover, who reported on the hurricane for a San
Juan, <ent type='GPE'>Puerto Rico</ent>, newspaper and is now studying for a graduate degree in
journalism at <ent type='ORG'>Columbia University</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>.</p>

<p>   Since the Disaster Relief Act of 1988, <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> has been responsible for
coordinating the "[disaster] preparedness, response and recovery actions of
state and local governments."  Unable to live up to these responsibilities
during the 1989 crisis, the agency drew sharp criticism from the press and
from <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, whose leaders assigned <ent type='ORG'>the General Accounting Office</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>GAO</ent>)
to conduct the first-ever detailed investigation of <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>.</p>

<p>   For a year, <ent type='ORG'>GAO</ent> field examiners interviewed hundreds of disaster
victims, state and local relief workers, journalists and other witnesses.
The agency has assembled a 71-page report on U.S. relief operations.</p>

<p>    WATCHDOG AGENCY RATES <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent></p>

<p>   Having obtained an advance copy of that survey, a team of SPOTLIGHT
reporters found that the congressional watchdog agency rated <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>'s ability
to deal with natural disasters as being "inefficient," "weak" and
"dilatory."</p>

<p>   Noting that "emergency management includes  three phases:
preparedness, response and recovery," <ent type='ORG'>GAO</ent> probers warned that <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> failed
to operate "as efficiently as possible" in all these areas.</p>

<p>   There was evidence of "inadequate planning ... inadequate or no
standard operating procedures ... [and a] lack of coordination" wherever
<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>'s bureaucrats intervened, the <ent type='ORG'>GAO</ent> report concluded.  Among the results
of these botched relief attempts were "delays in providing disaster
assistance and duplicate payments for some [of <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>'s] activities," the
congressional overseers discovered.</p>

<p>   One example of <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>'s failure cited by the <ent type='ORG'>GAO</ent> survey team involved
4000 low-income units wholly destroyed in <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>'s devastating October
1989 earthquake.  "Thirteen months later, only 114 units had been processed
and approved for [rehabilitation] funding," the report reveals.  Similarly,
10 months after Hurricane Hugo, most of the families left homeless "had not
yet been provided with housing assistance from <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>."</p>

<p>   DIRECTORS SHELL GAME</p>

<p>   Warned that the <ent type='ORG'>GAO</ent> report will expose <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> as incompetent and
wasteful, President George Bush fired agency Director Julius <ent type='ORG'>Becton</ent>, an
elderly three-star general, whose principal qualifications for flag rank
was Henry Kissinger's wish to promote "minority" officers, Defense
Department sources say.</p>

<p>   <ent type='ORG'>Becton</ent> was replace by Wallace Stickney, a former <ent type='GPE'>New Hampshire</ent> state
official whose colorless and low-profile reputation is expected to dampen
the fireworks the <ent type='ORG'>GAO</ent> report might otherwise touch off about the inadequacy
of federal relief operations.</p>

<p>   But simply shifting directors "does not answer the real question:  If
[<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> officials] seem uninterested and negligent when it comes to disaster
response, what are <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>'s thousands of bureaucrats working on?" asked
Groover.</p>

<p>   The answer, a SPOTLIGHT investigation has found, is that <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>'s
leadership is developing programs that will not merely "[ensure] the
continuity of the federal government in any national emergency-type
situation," as decreed by President Gerald Ford in <ent type='ORG'>Executive Order</ent> 11921,
but REPLACE the nation's Constitutional statecraft with a centralized
"command system."</p>
