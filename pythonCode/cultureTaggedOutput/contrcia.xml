<xml><p>SECRET TEAM OF WEAPONS DEALERS
by Vince Bielski</p>

<p>   A "secret team" of former <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and military officials and
arms dealers are responsible for the covert weapons shipments to
<ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> and the <ent type='NORP'>contras</ent> under the direction of fired <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>
aide Lt. Col. Oliver <ent type='ORG'>North</ent>.</p>

<p>   Members of the "secret team" came together in the secret war
against <ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent> in 1961, and have since been involved in "political
assassination" programs in <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent> and now
<ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>.</p>

<p>   The "secret team," through an association with known <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>
leaders, has resorted to opium and cocaine trafficking to
finance their operations.</p>

<p>   Edwin Wilson, the ex-<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> operative convicted for selling
explosives to <ent type='GPE'>Libya</ent>'s Moammar Gadhafi, was an active member.</p>

<p>   These allegations are part of a lengthy affidavit filed this
week in a <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> federal court  in support of a law suit brought
by Dan Sheehan, an attorney with <ent type='ORG'>the Christic Institute</ent> in
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>. The suit names 29 alledged operatives in the <ent type='NORP'>contras</ent>
arms network as defendants.</p>

<p>   The suit alleges that the defendants supplied the C-4
explosives which were used in the May 1984 assassination attempt
against <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> leader Eden Pastora in <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent> in which eight
people were killed and Pastora injured. The plaintiffs, Martha
Honey and Tony Avirgan, are <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> journalists who are sueing
for personal injuries they suffered from the bombing.</p>

<p>   <ent type='ORG'>The Christic Institute</ent>, a church funded public interest law
firm, has taken on controversial cases in the past, such as the
suit against Kerr McGree Nuclear Corporation on behalf of Karen
Silkwood. And it was while Sheehan was defending a sanctuary
worker that he received information which led him
into the investigation of the <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> arms supply opertation.</p>

<p>   In March 1984, he learned from a member of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency that <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> had a highly secret plan to
"deputize" government and <ent type='ORG'>State National Guard</ent> personnel for the
purpose of interning 400000 undocumented Central
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s in detention centers in the event that President Reagan
launched "Operation Night-train"--a military invasion into
<ent type='LOC'>Central America</ent>.</p>

<p>   The plan also called for the distribution from U.S. military
bases of hundreds of tons of weapons to be used by newly created
<ent type='ORG'>State Defense Forces</ent>, composed of civilians, who would help
enforce the "State of Domestic National Emergency" during the
invasion.  Sheehan learned from a <ent type='GPE'>Louisiana</ent> <ent type='ORG'>State National Guard</ent>
Colonel that a <ent type='ORG'>State Defense Force</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Louisiana</ent> planned to give
half of the weapons it received to the <ent type='NORP'>contras</ent>.</p>

<p>   In <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent>, former U.S. military personnel and active National
Guard units had organized a para-military organization, called
<ent type='ORG'>Civilian Military Assistance</ent>, to arm, train and fight with the
<ent type='NORP'>contras</ent>. The group, headed by Tom Posey, obtained "surplus"
military equipment from the 20th Special Forces Unit of the U.S.
Army in <ent type='GPE'>Alabama</ent>, Sheehan learned from a member of the group.</p>

<p>   In June 1984, Sheehan was informed a man who
working with the para-military organization in helping arm the
<ent type='NORP'>contras</ent> also claimed to be a "personal representative to the
<ent type='ORG'>Contras</ent> of...Lt. Col. Oliver <ent type='ORG'>North</ent>." His name is Robert Owen.</p>

<p>   One year later, Sheehan began putting this information into
a law suit when he learned that Posey, Owen and others
were allegedly involved in the bombing of the Pastora press
conference which caused physical and personal injury to the two
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> reporters.</p>

<p>   <ent type='NORP'>Sheehans</ent> investigation also led him to the discovery of a
"secret team" of former high ranking U.S. officials and officers
who oversaw the procurement and shipment of weapons to the
<ent type='NORP'>contras</ent> to to <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>. Through Posey, Owen and other they allegedly
supplied the explosives for the press conference bombing.  The
"secret team" includes former high-ranking <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> officials Theodore
<ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> and Thomas Clines, ret. <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> Gen. Richard Secord,
ex-<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> operative Edwin Wilson, and two arms dealers, Albert Hakim
(of <ent type='GPE'>Los Gatos</ent>) and Rafael Quintero, both of whom are U.S.
citizens.</p>

<p>   In the affidavit, which cites 79 seperate sources, Sheehan
said he learned of the "secret team" from a former U.S.
intelligence officer who worked in <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>, a retired <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> officer,
and a former <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> officer.</p>

<p>   The intelligence officer discussed "the existence of a
'secret team' of former high-ranking <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> officials,
former high-ranking U.S. military officials and <ent type='NORP'>Middle Eastern</ent>
arms merchants--who also specialized in the performance of covert
political assassinations of communists...(and) which carried on
its own, independent, <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> foreign policy--regardless of the
will of <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>,...the President,...or the (<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>)," the affidavit
reads.</p>

<p>   The source said the "secret team" was set up in
1977 under the supervision of <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> and Cline, who were then
with the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.  Wilson worked with Gadhafi "to secretly train
<ent type='GPE'>Libya</ent>n anti-Shah of <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> terrorists in the use of deadly C-4
explosives," the affidavit reads. Wilson's real purpose was to
gather intelligence on the anti-Shah terrorist missions, and then
pass the information to Quintero, "who was responsible for the
assassination of these <ent type='GPE'>Libya</ent>n terrorists,"</p>

<p>   Wilson was convicted for his dealings with Gadhafi, and
<ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> and Clines resigned under pressure from then-<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
director Stansfield Turner.  <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> and Clines then join with
Secord and Hakim and "went private" continuing to run their
"secret team," the affidavit reads.</p>

<p>   This group--initially through the Egyptian-<ent type='NORP'>American</ent>
Transport and Service Company--was "responsible for the entire
supply of weapons...to the <ent type='ORG'>Contras</ent>," when the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> wasn't directly
providing them. They began arming the <ent type='NORP'>contras</ent> in August 1979,
after entering "into a formal <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>ctual agreement with
<ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>n dictator Anastasio Somoza" despite President Carter's
order banning the sending of weapons to Somoza, the affidavit
reads.</p>

<p>   The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> took over in 1981, but when the 1984 ban on U.S.
support went into effect, <ent type='ORG'>North</ent> reactivated the private
merchants. Quintero, operating through a <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent> based
corporation named <ent type='ORG'>Orca Supply Company</ent>--a company earlier set up
by Edwin Wilson--saw to it that the supplies were delivered to
the <ent type='NORP'>contras</ent> through John <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent>, a U.S. citizen, who reportedly
operates a <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> base in northern <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent> on land he owns.
Among the delivered weapons were the explosives used in the
Pastor bombing, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> source said.</p>

<p>   To fund the <ent type='NORP'>contras</ent>, the "secret team" resorted to the
foreign military sales scheme used in <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> in which military
equipment is bought from the U.S. government at the
manufacturer's cost and sold to <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> at replacement cost. The
profits are then laundered through front companies.</p>

<p>  The <ent type='ORG'>Examiner</ent> reported in July that Secord, partners with
Hakim in <ent type='ORG'>Standford Technology Trading Group International</ent>, was
involved in the 1981 sale of AWACS to <ent type='GPE'>Saudi Arabia</ent>, in which
money from that sale financed the <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> operation.</p>

<p>   In another report, the <ent type='ORG'>Examiner</ent> said the weapons were also
financed by an elaborate cocaine ring involing <ent type='ORG'>Columbia</ent>'s largest
cocaine dealers in which the drug moves from <ent type='ORG'>Columbia</ent>,
through <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent>'s land, into the U.S at a level of one ton each
week.</p>

<p>   When <ent type='ORG'>the Reagan Administration</ent> decided to undertake the
secret sales of arms to <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> in 1985, it was <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent>, Clines,
Hakim and Secord whom they used to carry out the mission, the
affidavit reads.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND</p>

<p>   In 1961, <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent>, a <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> station chief in <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent>, and his
deputy Clines, directed the covert war against <ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>.  A special
unit formed to assassinate Castro, supervised by the "<ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>
Lieutenant Santo Trafficante," included Quintero--and Felix
Rodreguez and Luis <ent type='ORG'>Pasada</ent> Carillo--two ex-<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agent who
reportedly operate the <ent type='NORP'>contras</ent> arms network at an El Salvador air
base. <ent type='ORG'>Pasada</ent> was involved in the 1976 mid-air bombing
of a <ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>n passenger airliner.</p>

<p>   After the covert war activists were caught smuggling narcotics
into the U.S. from <ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>, the operation was shut down, and <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent>
and Clines were transfered to <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent>, where <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> was made <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
Deputy Chief of Station and Clines continued as his deputy.</p>

<p>   According to the affidavit, <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> and Clines directed a
secret program which trained and used Meo tribesmen "to
secretly assassinated over 100000 non-combatant village mayors,
book-keepers, clerks and other civilian bureaucrats in <ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Cambodia</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Thailand</ent>." The operation was funded by profits from
an illegal opium trade.</p>

<p>   A commander the political assassination program was ret.
Army General John Singlaub, who has said publicly that he is
helping arm the <ent type='NORP'>contras</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>North</ent>, a <ent type='ORG'>Marine Corps</ent> Major at the time,
was one of Singlaub's deputies. Also involved with <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> in
<ent type='GPE'>Laos</ent> was Secord, then an <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> General, the affidavit
reads.</p>

<p>   In 1971,  <ent type='ORG'>Shackley</ent> and Clines, from their post the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>'s
<ent type='LOC'>Western Hemisphere</ent> operations, directed the "Track II" operation
in <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent> which played a role in the assassination of <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent>an
President Salvador Allende, the affidavit reads.</p>

<p>   In 1974, the two directed the <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent> project in <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>,
which carried out the political assassination of some 60000 non-
<ent type='GPE'>Viet Cong</ent> civilians in an attempt to cripple <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>'s political
institutions.</p>

coming to a end,...(they) started their own private assassination
