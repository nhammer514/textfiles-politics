<xml><p>   In the best-selling 1962 spy thriller SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff plot to overthrow the U.S. president. Their 
conspiracy centers on a place called <ent type='LOC'>Mount Thunder</ent>, a secret 
subterranean command post where government leaders would go in the 
event of a nuclear attack.
   On December 1, 1974, a <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>TWA</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Boeing</ent></ent> 727 jet crashed into a fog-
shrouded mountain in northern <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> and burned, killing all 
ninety-two persons aboard. Near the wreckage was a fenced 
government reserve identified as <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent>.
   <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> is a real place; eighty-five acres located 
forty-five miles west of <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> and 1725 feet above sea 
level, near the town of <ent type='GPE'>Bluemont</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent>. In the event of all-
out war, an elite of civilian and military leaders are to be taken 
to <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent>'s cavernous underground shelter to become the 
nucleus of a postwar <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> society. The government has a secret 
list of those persons it plans to save.
   <ent type='ORG'>The Federal Emergency Management Agency</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>) runs Mount 
Weather. When it has to talk about the place, which is rare, it 
calls it the "special facility." Its more common name comes from a 
weather station that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had 
maintained on the mountain.
   The authors of SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher <ent type='LOC'>Knebel</ent></ent> and Charles 
W. <ent type='ORG'>Bailey II</ent>, were <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> journalists who learned a lot about 
the then-quite-secret post. Few readers of <ent type='LOC'>Knebel</ent> and Bailey's 
fiction could have imagined how close to the truth it was. The 
novel gives detailed highway directions from <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>:</p>

<p>   ...the <ent type='ORG'>Chrysler</ent> wheeled onto Route 50,
  heading away from <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>....
   In the jungle of neon lights and access 
  roads at Seven Corners, Corwin saw Scott bear 
  right onto Route 7, the main road to <ent type='GPE'>Leesburg</ent>. 
  The two cars moved slowly through <ent type='ORG'>Falls Church</ent> 
  before the traffic began to thin out and speed 
  up....
   At the fork west of <ent type='GPE'>Leesburg</ent>, Scott bore 
  right on Route 9, heading toward Charles 
  Town.... They began to climb toward the Blue 
  Ridge, the eastern rim of the Shenandoah 
  Valley....
   West of <ent type='ORG'>Hillboro</ent>, where the road crossed 
  the Blue Ridge before dropping into the 
  valley....Scott turned left. Corwin followed 
  him onto a black macadam road that ran 
  straight along the spine of the ridge.
   ...Because of his <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> job, Corwin 
  knew something about this road that few other 
  <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s did. <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> 120 appeared to be 
  nothing more than a better-than-average Blue 
  Ridge byway, but it ran past <ent type='LOC'>Mount Thunder</ent>, 
  where an underground installation provided one 
  of the several bases from which the President 
  could run the nation in the event of a nuclear 
  attack on <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>.
  
   <ent type='LOC'>Knebel</ent> and Bailey disguised the directions slightly. You 
continue on Route 7 west of <ent type='GPE'>Leesburg</ent>, turning left on Route 601 
just west of <ent type='GPE'>Bluemont</ent>. It's <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> Route 601 that runs right up 
to the gates of <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent>. Residents have long known there is 
something funny about that road; it is always the first road 
cleared after a snowstorm.
   At one point, the government asked the local paper not to 
print any articles about the facility. But it is all but 
impossible to keep such a place secret. <ent type='ORG'>The Appalachian Trail</ent> runs 
right by <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent>, and hikers can get close enough to see 
signs and flashing lights. One sign reads: "All persons and 
vehicles entering hereon are liable to search. Photographing, 
making notes, drawings, maps or graphic representations of this 
area or its activities are prohibited." In the late 1960s an 
unidentified "hippie" is supposed to have stumbled upon the 
facility and sketched it from a tree. His drawing turned up in the 
QUICKSILVER TIMES, an underground newspaper in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>.
   Residents also tell of the time a hunt club chased a fox onto 
the site and triggered an alarm. The club had to go to the main 
gate to get the dogs back.
   After the <ent type='ORG'>TWA</ent> crash, a spokesman "politely declined to 
comment on what Mt. Weather was used for, how many people work 
there, or how long it has been in its current use," the <ent type='GPE'>WASHINGTON</ent> 
POST reported. The POST published a picture of the facility, 
citing far-fetched speculation that <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent>'s radio antennas 
may have interfered with the jet's radar and caused the disaster.
   You don't get into <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> without an invitation. The 
entrance is said to be like the door to a bank vault, only 
thicker, set into a mountain made out of the toughest granite in 
the <ent type='LOC'>East</ent>. It is guarded around the clock.
   <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> got more unsolicited publicity in 1975. Senator 
John Tunney (D-<ent type='GPE'>Calif</ent>.) charged that <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> held dossiers on 
100000 or more <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>s. A sophisticated computer system gives 
the installation access to detailed information on the lives of 
virtually every <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> citizen, Tunney claimed. <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> 
personnel stonewalled question after question in two <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> 
hearings.
   "I don't understand what they're trying to hide out there," 
Douglas Lea, staff director of the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> Subcommittee on 
Constitutional Rights, said. "<ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> is just closed up to 
us." Tunney complained that <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> was "out of control."
   <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> has been owned by the government since 1903, 
when the site was purchased by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Calvin Coolidge talked about building a summer <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> there. 
In World War I it was an artillery range, and during the 
Depression it was a <ent type='ORG'>workfarm</ent> for hobos. <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> as an 
alternate capital seems to have been the idea of Millard F. 
<ent type='ORG'>Caldwell</ent>, former governor of <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>.
   There is a fallout shelter under the <ent type='LOC'>East</ent> Wing of the White 
House. No one believes it offers any real protection from a 
nuclear attack on <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, however. <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> has elaborate plans 
for getting the president and other key officials out of 
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> should there be a nuclear attack.
   In that event, the president is supposed to board a <ent type='ORG'>Boeing</ent> 
747 <ent type='ORG'>National Emergency Airborne Command Post</ent> ("<ent type='GPE'>Kneecap</ent>"). That is 
presumed to be safer than any point on the ground. The president's 
plane can be refueled in the air from other planes and may be able 
to stay airborne for as long as three days. Then its engine will 
conk out for lack of oil. That is where <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> comes in.
   Government geologists selected the site because it has some 
of the most impregnable rock in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>. The shelter was 
started in the Truman administration, and it took years to tunnel 
into the mountain.
   There is a whole chain of shelters for leaders and critical 
personnel. <ent type='ORG'>The Federal Relocation Arc</ent>, a system of ninety-six 
shelters for specific U.S. Government agencies, sweeps through 
<ent type='GPE'>North Carolina</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent>, West <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Maryland</ent>, and 
<ent type='GPE'>Pennsylvania</ent>. A duplicate of the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> is located at a site 
called <ent type='GPE'>Raven Rock</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Maryland</ent>. The administrative center of the 
whole system, and the place where the top civilians would go, is 
<ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent>.
   <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> is much more than a fallout shelter; it is a 
troglodytic <ent type='GPE'>Levittown</ent>. In the mid-1970s Richard Pollack, a writer 
for PROGRESSIVE magazine, interviewed a number of persons who had 
been associated with <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent>. According to them, Mount 
Weather is an underground city with roads, sidewalks, and a 
battery-powered subway. A spring-fed artificial lake gleams in the 
fluorescent light. There are office buildings, cafeterias, and 
hospitals. Large dormitories are furnished with bunks or "hot 
cots" -- hammocks intended to be occupied in three eight-hour 
shifts. There are private apartments as well. <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> has 
its own waterworks, food storage, and power plant. A "bubble-
shaped pod" in the <ent type='LOC'>East</ent> Tunnel houses one of the most powerful 
computers in the world.
   The Situation Room, a circular chamber, would be a nerve 
center in the time of war. The <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> folks set great store 
by visual aids and retain artists and cartographers at all times. 
A futuristic color videophone system is the basic means of 
communication within <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent>'s subterranean world. "All 
important staff meetings were conducted via color television as 
far back as 1958, long before it was generally available to the 
public," one former staffer bragged. 
   The most surprising of Pollack's revelations is that Mount 
Weather has a working back-up of U.S. Government EVEN NOW. 
Undisclosed persons there duplicate the responsibilities of our 
elected leaders, making <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> an eerie doppelganger of the 
United States.
   An Office of the Presidency is ensconced in an underground 
wing known as the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>. The elected president or survivor 
closest in the chain of command would make his way there and take 
over the reins. Until then, a staffer appointed by <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> would be 
carrying out duties said to simulate those of the real president.
   Installed at <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> are nine federal departments, 
their very names ironic in the context: Agriculture, Commerce, 
Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, 
Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, and the <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent>. 
Miniature versions of the Selective Service, <ent type='ORG'>the Veteran</ent>'s 
Administration, <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Communications Commission</ent>, the Post 
Office, <ent type='ORG'>the Civil Service Commission</ent>, the Federal Power 
Commission, and <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Reserve</ent> are there, too.
   "High-level government sources, speaking under the promise of 
strict anonymity, told me that each of the federal departments 
represented at <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> is headed by a single person on who 
is conferred <ent type='ORG'>Cabinet</ent>-level official," Pollack reported. "Protocol 
even demands that subordinates address them as 'Mr. Secretary.' 
Each of the <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> '<ent type='ORG'>Cabinet</ent> members' is apparently 
appointed by the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> and serves an indefinite term. Many 
of the 'secretaries' have held their positions through several 
administrations."
   What do all these people DO? Twice a month, <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> 
stages a war game to train its personnel and explore various dire 
scenarios. Once a year they pull out all the stops and have a 
super drill in which REAL <ent type='ORG'>Cabinet</ent> members and <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> staffers 
fly in from <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>.
   General Leslie Bray, director of the Federal Preparedness 
Agency, <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>'s predecessor, told the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> that <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> has 
extensive files on "military installations, government facilities, 
communications, transportation, energy and power, agriculture, 
manufacturing, wholesale and retail services, manpower, financial, 
medical and educational institutions, sanitary facilities, 
population, housing shelter, and stockpiles." Additional 
information is kept in safekeeping at other shelters in the 
Federal Relocation Arc.
   There is a body of opinion that considers <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> 
obsolete. <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> is a non-movable target, and a very 
strategic one if the relocation works. The "toughest granite in 
the <ent type='LOC'>East</ent>" may have offered some protection in Eisenhower's time, 
but multiple strikes could blast the mountain away. It was 
reported that the <ent type='ORG'>TWA</ent> jet crash knocked out power at <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> 
for two and a half hours. What would a bomb do?
   <ent type='GPE'>The Soviet Union</ent> knows exactly where <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> is -- and 
almost certainly knew long before the Western press did. The 
<ent type='NORP'>Soviets</ent> tried to buy an estate near <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> as a "vacation 
retreat" for embassy employees. <ent type='ORG'>The State Department</ent> stopped the 
sale.</p>

<p>   
The Survivor List
   
   In 1975 General Bray told the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> that the <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> 
survivor list had sixty-five hundred names on it. Who might be 
included?
   The president, of course, provide he survives his <ent type='GPE'>Kneecap</ent> 
command. The vice-president and <ent type='ORG'>Cabinet</ent> members are on the list 
because they take part in the annual dry runs. Beyond that, little 
is known and the few existing accounts conflict.
   For instance, what about <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>? General Bray said that his 
responsibilities included the executive branch only, not <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> 
or <ent type='ORG'>the Supreme Court</ent>. But in an interview in 1976, Senator Hubert 
Humphrey insisted that he had visited the shelter as vice-
president and seen "a nice little chamber, rostrum and all," for 
<ent type='ORG'>postnuclear</ent> sessions of <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>.
   Furthermore, Earl Warren is said to have been invited when he 
was Chief Justice of <ent type='ORG'>the Supreme Court</ent>. Warren refused because he 
was not allowed to take his wife. The protocol for ordering 
persons to <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> specifies that messages not be left with 
family members answering the phone.
   The vast majority of the persons on the list are believed to 
be ranking bureaucrats from the nine federal agencies with 
branches at <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent>. Pollack said he heard stories that some 
construction workers were on the list "because, the <ent type='LOC'>Mount Weather</ent> 
analysts reasoned, excavation work for mass graves would be needed 
immediately in the aftermath of a thermonuclear war." General Bray 
admitted that some others such as telephone company technicians 
are included.
   Each person on the survival list has an ID card with a photo. 
The card reads: <ent type='ORG'>THE PERSON DESCRIBED</ent> ON THIS CARD HAS ESSENTIAL 
EMERGENCY DUTIES WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. REQUEST FULL 
ASSISTANCE AND <ent type='ORG'>UNRESTRICTED MOVEMENT BE</ent> AFFORDED THE PERSON TO 
WHOM THIS CARD IS ISSUED.
