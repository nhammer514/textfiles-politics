Bush's <ent type='ORG'>Boys Club</ent>: <ent type='ORG'>Skull</ent> and Bones
 
  To be a member of the ruling elite, George Bush must meet
certain criteria. He must be white, he must be male, and he must
be rich. He must also belong to certain elite clubs and
institutions which help to distinguish him from those he is
called upon to rule.
  George Bush is a member of <ent type='ORG'>Skull</ent> and Bones, an elite
secret society open only to a select 15 males in their senior
year at <ent type='ORG'>Yale University</ent>. If this club appears somewhat
exclusionary, don't worry; they have made great strides in the
past few years. Recent Bones inductees include a few blacks,
gays, and even some foreign students. However, it has been said
that if women were ever allowed into the secret "tomb" (meeting
place) of <ent type='ORG'>Skull</ent> and Bones, the tomb would "have to be
bulldozed."
  The importance of <ent type='ORG'>Skull</ent> and Bones is not that it provides
good gossip about young males doing strange things in tombs, but
that it provides a certain bond between members which they carry
for life. Membership to <ent type='ORG'>Skull</ent> and Bones is the first initiation
into the world of power politics and capitalism. It is somewhat
akin to a "junior" old boys' network.
  One of the interesting aspects of this secret society is
the number of Bones members who, after graduation, move on to do
intelligence work. There has even been informed speculation that
there is a "Bones cell" in the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.
  Whether there is a Bones cell or not in the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> is open to
interesting debate. We can, however, examine the histories of
several Bonesmen who have gone on to illustrious careers in
intelligence work.
  One of the most unusual Bonesmen is the Reverend William
Sloane Coffin, Jr. Known best for his anti-<ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> war activities
and his political activism at <ent type='ORG'>Riverside Church</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>New York City</ent>,
Sloane Coffin was recruited by the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> shortly after he graduated
from <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> in 1949. Although his tenure at the <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> was short,
he is one example of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>'s use of the secret society to fill
their ranks.
  Another illustrious <ent type='ORG'>Skull</ent> and Bones member with close ties
to the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> is arch-conservative and reknowned propagandist
William F. <ent type='ORG'>Buckley</ent>. According to several experts on the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'>Buckley</ent> began his cooperation with the <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> while he was in
<ent type='GPE'>Mexico City</ent> in 1952, where his good friend, E. Howard Hunt, was
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> station chief at the time.
  As an interesting aside, <ent type='ORG'>Buckley</ent> and Bush (as well as many
other <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> and business elites) are members of the
"prestigious" older-boys <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> getaway, "The Bohemian
Club."
  It is not surprising, given the <ent type='ORG'>Buckley</ent> family's wealth and
status, that Bill's older brother, James <ent type='ORG'>Buckley</ent>, is also a
member of <ent type='ORG'>Skull</ent> and Bones. From 1981-82 <ent type='ORG'>Buckley</ent> was Under
Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>State for Security Assistance</ent>, Science, and
Technology where it was his job to see the U.S. military aid went
to support the right regimes.
  He once stated that <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> covert activities in <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent>, which
led to the overthrow of democratically-elected Salvador Allende,
were necessary because, "It was only by virtue of covert help by
<ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> that these free institutions were able to
survive in the face of increasingly repressive measures by the
Allende regime."
  <ent type='ORG'>Buckley</ent> was also directly connected to the work of the
<ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent>an secret police, <ent type='ORG'>DINA</ent>. In September 1976, <ent type='ORG'>DINA</ent> agents
assassinated former <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent>an diplomat Orlando Letelier and his
colleague, Ronni Moffitt, in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> DC. "Independent
researchers verified through the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> and Department of Justice --
that on September 14, 1976, one week before the Letelier
assassination, Michael Townley and Guillermo <ent type='ORG'>Novo</ent> [two <ent type='ORG'>DINA</ent>
agents involved in the assassination] drove to the office of
Senator James <ent type='ORG'>Buckley</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>New York City</ent> for a meeting. <ent type='ORG'>Buckley</ent> had
helped finance trips to <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent> for <ent type='ORG'>Novo</ent> and others close to the
killing."
  When <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agent David Atlee Phillips was accused of being
involved in the assassination he started an organization
entitled "<ent type='ORG'>Challenge</ent>: An Intelligence Officers' Legal Action
Fund." The board of "<ent type='ORG'>Challenge</ent>" included former <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> director
William Colby, former <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> Inspector General Lyman Kirkpatrick,
former intelligence officer General Richard Stillwell, and
interestingly, James <ent type='ORG'>Buckley</ent>.
  Hugh Cunningham, Bonesman from the class of 1934, is a
Rhodes Scholar with a lengthy career in the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>. He was in the
<ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> from 1947 to 1973 during which time he served in top
positions with the Clandestine Services, <ent type='ORG'>the Board</ent> of National
Estimates, and was the Director of Training from 1969-73. He also
served with the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>'s precursor, <ent type='ORG'>the Central Intelligence Group</ent>,
from 1945-47.
  William Bundy is a Bonesman from the class of 1939. Bundy
began his intelligence career in the <ent type='ORG'>OSS</ent> during World War II.
From 1951-61 he worked at the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, including at its Office of
National Estimates. During the <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent> War, he was the Assistant
Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> for Asian Affairs and a vocal advocate for
escalating the war.
  A true Cold War liberal, Bundy expressed his belief in the
necessity of <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> covert actions in his foreword to the book "The
Counter-Insurgency Era": "The preservation of liberal values, for
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent> and other nations, required the use of the full range of
U.S. power, including, if necessary, its more shady
applications." "<ent type='ORG'>Shady</ent> applications" is a veiled euphemism for
covert activities which support dictators, overthrow legitimate
governments, and contribute to the destabilization of world
order.
  From the class of 1950 comes Bonesman Dino Pionzio. His
claim to fame was the time he spent as <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> deputy chief of
station in <ent type='GPE'>Santiago</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent>, in 1970, during the massive <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
destabilization of the Allende government. He is also a member of
<ent type='ORG'>the Association</ent> of Former Intelligence Officers. The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> proved
not to be lucrative enough for Pionzio so he left his
intelligence career behind and became an investment banker. As of
1983, he was a vice president at the investment firm <ent type='ORG'>Dillon</ent>,
Read. (Just to illustrate how small these circles really are --
Nicholas Brady, the current Secretary of the <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent>, was the
co-chair of <ent type='ORG'>Dillon</ent>, Read, and a graduate of <ent type='ORG'>Yale University</ent>.
Brady, however, was not a Bonesman. He belonged to another <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent>
secret society called "Book and Snake.")
  From the days of George Bush's father, Prescott Bush, comes
former spook F. Trubee Davidson. Davidson, a Bonesman from the
class of 1918, was the Director of Personnel at the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> in 1951.
Davidson then begot little Bonesmen, Endicott Peabody Davidson
and Daniel Pomeroy Davidson. <ent type='ORG'>Endicott Davidson</ent> went to work at
the law firm of <ent type='ORG'>Winthrop</ent>, Stimson, Putnam, and Roberts (Henry
Stimson was the Secretary of War during World War II and also a
Bonesman.)
  Another interesting Bonesman is David Lyle Boren, the
<ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent> from <ent type='GPE'>Oklahoma</ent>. While he is not an employee of the
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> (some say this is open to question), Boren nevertheless is
part of the intelligence community because he is the chair of the
Select Committee on Intelligence.
  Finally, but certainly not the end of the list, comes
Richard A. Moore. Moore began his intelligence career in World
War II where he served as a special assistant to the chief of
military intelligence. He was rewarded for this service with the
Legion of Merit for Intelligence Work.
  In the 1970s, Moore was special assistant to President
Nixon and in the thick of things during the Watergate scandal. At
his recent congressional confirmation hearing for the post of
Ambassador to <ent type='GPE'>Ireland</ent>, Moore was asked by one of the committee
members if he was one of 14 unnamed and unindicted
co-conspirators of the Watergate scandal. Moore, however,
emphatically denied the accusation. It is interesting to note
that Moore, a Bonesman from 1936, was recently appointed to a
high-level <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> Department post by George Bush, Bonesman, 1948.
  The list of Bonesmen-made-good goes on and on and includes
McGeorge Bundy (<ent type='ORG'>National Security Advisor</ent> to Kennedy and
Johnson), William Draper (Defense Department Import-Export Bank,
etc.), <ent type='ORG'>Dean Witter</ent>, Jr. (investment banker), <ent type='ORG'>Potter Stewart</ent>
(<ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent> Justice who swore in George Bush as Vice
President in 1981), John Forbes Kerry (Senator from
<ent type='GPE'>Massachusetts</ent>), Winston Lord (Kissinger protege and former
Ambassador to <ent type='GPE'>China</ent>), Robert H. Gow (president of Zapata Oil,
once owned by Bush and which had possible links to the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>), and
Henry Luce of Time-Life fame.
  This old (and new) boys network helps to illustrate the old
adage "it's not what you know, it's who you know." Given the
extent of Bones members in intelligence, it is also "how you come
to know it."                   </p></xml>
