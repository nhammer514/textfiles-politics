<xml><p>SOLDIER OF FORTUNE DIES MYSTERIOUSLY AFTER
TALKING TO <ent type='ORG'>CONGRESSIONAL</ent> INVESTIGATORS</p>

<p>by Vince Bielski and Dennis Bernstein</p>

<p>   A county coroner in <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent> has yet to announce the
cause of death of Steven Carr, a 27-year-old U.S. mercenary who
has provided <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> with much of what it knows about weapons
shipments to the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent>. Had Carr lived, he was also expected to
testified in federal court against 29 <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> supporters allegedly
involved in cocaine trafficking, an assassination attempt on
former <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> leader Eden Pastora and a scheme to kill U.S
Ambassador to <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent> Lewis</ent> Tambs.</p>

<p>   While Detective Mel Arnold of the <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent> Police
Department said the department is investigating the possibility
that Carr was murdered, at this point he said there doesn't
appear to be any evidence of "foul play." But in the days before
his death, Carr told several people that he feared he would be
assassinated. He was "very paranoid and frightened" because of
his role as a witness, Carr's sister Ann of <ent type='GPE'>Naples</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Fla</ent>., said.</p>

<p>   Here is what the police are saying about Carr's death. He
died at 4 am on December 13 in a parking lot near his friend's
apartment in <ent type='GPE'>Van Nuys</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Calif</ent>., where he was staying.  In the
predawn hours on this Saturday morning, while his friend,
Jacqueline Scott, was asleep, Carr left the apartment for an
unknown reason.  After spending an undetermined amount of time
outside, Carr began making noise which awoke Scott.  Arnold said
he could not describe the type of noise Carr was making. Scott
found Carr in the parking lot, who was "distressed and having
coordination problems." Soon after he died from a "probable
cocaine overdose." Asked if the police found any physical
evidence of cocaine use in the area of the apartment or parking
lot,  Arnold said "no comment."</p>

<p>   Dan Sheehan, an attorney with <ent type='ORG'>the Christic Institute</ent> in
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> which filed the law suit against the 29 <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>
supporter, said Carr used cocaine, but called him "an educated
user." Martha <ent type='ORG'>Honey</ent>, a reporter for the <ent type='ORG'>BBC</ent>, became friends with
Carr while he was a mercenary in <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>. She said Carr was
not the type of person who would kill himself because he was
under pressure. "Stevie was a survivor. He had this ability to get
himself in trouble but he always seemed to bounce back. He had a
great sense of humor."</p>

<p>   The source of his fears were not just the <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>
supporters whose alleged crimes he revealed, but also the U.S.
government.  Carr said that while he was in <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>, U.S.
embassy officials threatened to jail him if he squealed on their
<ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> operation in <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>.</p>

<p>   In April 1985 Carr was arrested by <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>n authorities
for violating the country's neutrality and sent to prison. Carr
was one of several mercenaries based in northern <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent> on
land owned and managed by a U.S. citizen and reported <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
operative named John <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent>.  Evidence from several sources suggests
that the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent> operate what amounts to a military base on
property controlled by <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent> as well as an airbase for the
movement of cocaine from <ent type='ORG'>Columbia</ent> into <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>.</p>

<p>   While in jail, Carr spilled the beans about the <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>
operation. To reporters, he claimed that <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent> had told him that
<ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent> was the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> liaison to the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent> and was receiving $10000 a
month from <ent type='ORG'>the National Security Council</ent> to help finance the
operation.  Carr told <ent type='ORG'>Honey</ent> why he was revealing such secrets:
"Carr said that the mercenaries had been led to believe that
their mercenary activity was sanctioned by top U.S. military and
<ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>n officials. He was extremely bitter at having been
arrested."</p>

<p>   <ent type='ORG'>Honey</ent> compiled information from Carr and other sources into
a book focusing on the role of <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent> and other <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> supporters in
the May 1984 assassination attempt against Pastora in <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>
in which a bomb explosion killed eight people and injured
Pastora. <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent> sued <ent type='ORG'>Honey</ent>, and her colleague Tony Avirgan, for
libel in May 1986. Carr received a subpoena to appear at the
trial, where he was to be a key witness for the reporters'
defense.</p>

<p>   On May 16, Carr was released from jail. He later described
the events which took place in his life over the course of the
next week to <ent type='ORG'>Honey</ent> and an U.S. congressional aide involved in an
investigation of the arms supply network to the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>s</ent>.</p>

<p>   Carr said that <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent> bailed him out of jail as a way of
persuading him to testify on <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent>'s behalf. <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent> requested that
Carr testify that the reporters forced him to make the charges
against <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent>, Carr said.</p>

<p>   That same day, Carr said he went to the U.S. embassy to
determine why he was arrested for participating in a war that the
U.S. supports. He said he met with two officials, Kirk Kotula,
the counsel general and John Jones, the acting chief of the
consulute.</p>

<p>   According to <ent type='ORG'>Honey</ent>'s notes of her conversation with Carr
about his meeting with the officials, Carr said: "The officials
told me they knew all about <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent>'s <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> operation and they had
me call him. He picked up the phone instantly, as if he had been
waiting for my call.</p>

<p>   "They said if I go to court and testify in your behalf I'll
go to jail whether I tell the truth or not. I had no choice in
the matter. The embassy told me to get the hell out of <ent type='ORG'>Dodge</ent> or
I'd go back to <ent type='ORG'>La Reforma</ent> prison.  They told me that the bus to
<ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent> leaves at 7:30 pm and to be on it," he said.</p>

<p>   Carr spent the next three days staying at <ent type='ORG'>Honey</ent>'s house. On
night of May 19, Carr left the house to visit a friend, and the
following day, the U.S. embassy told the court that Carr was in
their custody and that he would appear at the trial, <ent type='ORG'>Honey</ent> said.
However, Carr said on May 20, following U.S. embassy orders, he
took a bus to <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>, and with the help to the U.S. embassy
there, flew to <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> a few days later. Upon his return, Carr was
put in jail in <ent type='GPE'>Naples</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Fla</ent>., for a prior offense.</p>

<p>   Kotula said he had talked with Carr, but denied the he had
threatened him or forced him to leave <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>. "That's not
true, at least by me. I did not threaten him with any such thing.
I couldn't do that, what would be the possible motive.  I can't
put people in jail and I can't get people out of jail.</p>

<p>   "I tried to convince Steve Carr when I first met him not to
go and join up with some bunch of guys. He was nothing but a
overgrown child who had read too many John Wayne comic books."</p>

<p>   Jonathan <ent type='ORG'>Winer</ent>, an aide to Sen. John Kerry D-Mass., said
the Senator's office is investigating the matter. "There are
obviously some very serious questions regarding the U.S.
embassy's role in Steven Carr leaving <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>," he said.</p>

<p>   After Carr's return to the U.S., congressional investigators
said they had planned on bringing him before <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>. His
testimony, based on his participation on a March 6, 1985 arms
shipment from <ent type='GPE'>Fort Lauderdale</ent> to Ilogango Air Base in El
Salvador, would have linked Felix Rodriguez--the ex-<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agent who
reportedly met with Donald Gregg, aide to Vice President George
Bush--to that weapons shipment, Sheehan said.</p>

<p>   "He is the guy that can prove that the March 6
shipment of weapons that flew out of the <ent type='GPE'>Fort Lauderdale</ent> Airport
went to <ent type='LOC'>Ilopango</ent> airport," said Sheehan.  "He witnessed and can
identify Felix Rodriguez as the guy who off loaded the weapons to
smaller planes which were then flown to <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent>'s ranch in Costa
Rica."</p>

<p>   In early 1986, Carr and two other eye-witnesses told federal
authorities that several major players in the arms supply network
were involved in the shipment, including Tom Posey, head of the
mercenary group <ent type='ORG'>Civilian Materiel Assistance</ent>, Robert Owen,
reportedly a liaison to fired Lt. Col. Oliver North, and <ent type='GPE'>Hull</ent>,
Sheehan said.</p>

<p>   With no criminal indictment by October, Sheehan alleged
before a congressional committee that <ent type='ORG'>the Justice Department</ent> had
engaged in a "willfull conspiracy...to obstruct justice....A
number of telephone calls were then placed to Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Kellner</ent> (the
U.S. Attorney in <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent>) personally by Edwin Meese...instructing
Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Kellner</ent> 'to proceed very, very, very slowly' in any
investigation of this case." <ent type='ORG'>Kellner</ent> has said he
has talked with Meese about the case, but denied Sheehan's
allegation.</p>

<p>   A grand jury has recently formed in <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> to reportedly hear
evidence about the March 6 weapons shipment. But the one person
who could have provided the grand jury with an eye-witness
account that the weapons were transported from U.S. soil to El
Salvador--evidence which is essential in making a case that the
U.S. Neutrality Act and <ent type='ORG'>the Arms Export Control Act</ent> were
violated--is now dead.</p>

<p>   "A great deal of the information Carr provided did check
out. It will now be harder for anyone to bring a prosecution with
Steven's testimony now unavailable, and I think that is very
unfortunate," <ent type='ORG'>Winer</ent> said.
