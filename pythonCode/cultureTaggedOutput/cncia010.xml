   SECRET CONCENTRATION CAMPS
 
 The September issue of <ent type='ORG'>THE OSTRICH</ent> reprinted a story from the
 <ent type='ORG'>CBA</ent> BULLETIN which listed the following principal civilian <ent type='ORG'>concentra</ent>-
 tion camps established in <ent type='ORG'>GULAG USA</ent> under the =Rex '84= program:
 Ft. Chaffee, <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent>; Ft. Drum, <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>; Ft. Indian Gap, <ent type='GPE'>Penn</ent>-

 <ent type='GPE'>Wisconsin</ent>; Ft. Benning, <ent type='GPE'>Georgia</ent>; Ft. <ent type='GPE'>Huachuca</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent>; Camp
 Krome, <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>.  The February OSTRICH printed a map of the expanding
 <ent type='ORG'>Gulag</ent>.  <ent type='GPE'>Alhough</ent> this listing and map stirred considerable interest,
 the report was not new.  For at least 20 years, knowledgeable <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Patriot</ent>s</ent>
 have been warning of these sinister plots to incarcerate dissidents
 opposing plans of the =<ent type='ORG'>Elitist Syndicate</ent>= for a totalitarian
 =New World Order=.  Indeed, the plot was recognized with the insidious
 encroachment of "regionalism" back in the 1960's.  As early as 1968,
 the "greatest land steal in history" leading to global corporate
 socialism, was in a ="Master Land Plan"= for <ent type='GPE'>the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent>
 by =<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Orders</ent>= involving water resource regions, 
 population movement and control, pollution control, zoning
 and land use, navigation and environmental bills, etc.  Indeed,
 the real undercover aim of the so-called "Environmental Rennaissance"
 has been the abolition of private property.
 All prelude to the total grab of the =<ent type='ORG'>World Conservation Bank</ent>=,
 as <ent type='ORG'>THE OSTRICH</ent> has been reporting.  The map on this page and
 the list of executive orders available for imposition of an "emergency"
 are from 1970s files of the late Gen. =P. A. <ent type='ORG'>Del Valle</ent>'s= <ent type='ORG'>ALERT</ent>,

  international tension or financial crisis".  He is also to
  perform such additional functions as the President
  may direct.</p>

   A Dangerous Fact Not Generally Known
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS GROSSLY AND FLAGRANTLY VIOLATE ARTICLE
   4 SECTION 4 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF <ent type='GPE'>THE UNITED STATES</ent>.  "THE
   UNITED STATES SHALL GUARANTEE TO EVERY STATE IN THIS UNION A
   REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT, AND SHALL PROTECT EACH OF THEM
   AGA<ent type='ORG'>INS</ent>T INVASION; AND ON APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE, OR OF THE
   EXECUTIVE (WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT BE CONVENED) AGA<ent type='ORG'>INS</ent>T
   DOMESTIC VIOLENCE."  "REGIONAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT A REPRESENTATIVE
   REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT!"</p>

<p>   When Government gets out of hand and can no longer be controlled
   by the people, short of violent overthrow as in 1776, there are
   two sources of power which are used by the dictatorial government
   to keep the people in line:  <ent type='ORG'>the Police Power</ent> and the Power of the
   Purse (through which the necessities of life can be withheld).
   And both of these powers are no longer balanced between the three
   Federal Branches, and between the Federal and the <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> and
   local Governments.  These powers have been taken over, with the
   permission of <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Legislature</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> Governments,
   by <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Branch of</ent> <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Government</ent> and all attempts
   to reclaim that lost power have been defeated.</p>

<p>   <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>d simply:  the dictatorial power of the <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> rests primarily
   on three basis:  <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Order 11490, <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Order 11647, and
   the Planning, Programming, Budgeting System which is operated
   through the new and all-powerful Office of Management and
   Budget.</p>

<p> E. O. 11490 is a compilation of some 23 previous <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Orders</ent>,
   signed by Nixon on Oct. 28, 1969, and outlining emergency functions
   which are to be performed by some 28 <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Departments and
   Agencies whenever the President of <ent type='GPE'>the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent> declares
   a national emergency (as in defiance of an impeachment edict,
   for example).  Under the terms of E. O. 11490, the President
   can declare that a national emergency exists and the <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent>
   Branch can:
   * Take over all communications media
   * Seize all sources of power
   * Take charge of all food resources
   * Control all highways and seaports
   * Seize all railroads, inland waterways, airports, storage facilities
   * Commandeer all civilians to work under federal supervision
   * Control all activities relating to health, education, and welfare
   * Shift any segment of the population from one locality to another
   * Take over farms, ranches, timberized properties
   * Regulate the amount of your own money you may withdraw from
 your bank, or savings and loan institution</p>

<p>   All of these and many more items are listed in 32 pages incorporating
   nearly 200000 words, providing and absolute bureaucratic
   dictatorship whenever the President gives the word.</p>

<p>--&gt;  <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Order 11647 provides the regional and local mechanisms
--&gt;  and manpower for carrying out the provisions of E. O. 11490.
--&gt;  Signed by Richard Nixon on Feb. 10, 1972, this Order sets up Ten 
--&gt;  <ent type='ORG'>Federal Regional Councils</ent> to govern <ent type='ORG'>Ten <ent type='ORG'>Federal Regions</ent></ent> made up
--&gt;  of the fifty still existing <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s of the Union.

<p>   Then, controlling the bedgeting and the programming at every

<p>   The President need not wait for some emergency such as an impeachment
   ouster.  He can declare a National Emergency at any time, and freeze
   everything, just as he has already frozen wages and prices.  And
   the <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, and the <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s, are powerless to prevent such an
   <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Dictatorship, unless <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> moves to revoke these

   them.</p>

<p>   THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS GROSSLY AND FLAGRANTLY VIOLATE THE INTENT AND

<p>   By Proclaiming and Putting Into Effect <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Order No. 11490,
   the President would put <ent type='GPE'>the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent> under TOTAL MARTIAL LAW

<p>  A war, even the most victorious, is a national misfortune.
   --Helmuth Von Moltke, <ent type='NORP'>Prussian</ent> field marshall</p>

<p> George Bush put <ent type='GPE'>the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent> on the road to its <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ond war in
  two years by declaring a national emergency on August 21990.  In
  response to <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>'s invasion of <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>, Bush issued two <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent>
  Orders (12722 and 12723) which restricted trade and travel with <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>
  and froze <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>i and <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>i assets within the U.S. and those in the
  possession of U.S. persons abroad.  At least 15 other executive orders
  followed these initial restrictions and enabled the President to
  mobilize the country's human and productive resources for war.  Under
  the national emergency, Bush was able unilaterally to break his 1991
  budget agreement with <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> which had frozen defense spending, to
  entrench further the U.S. economy in the mire of the military-
  industrial complex, to override environmental protection regulations,
  and to make free enterprise and civil liberties conditional upon an
  executive determination of national <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity interests.</p>

<p>  The <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> of Emergency
 In time of war a president's power derives from both constitutional
  and statutory sources.  Under Article II, Section 2 of the
  Constitution, he is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.  Although
  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> alone retains the right to declare war, this power has become
  increasingly meaningless in the face of a succession of unilateral
  decisions by the executive to mount invasions.
 The president's statutory authority, granted by <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and
  expanded by it under the 1988 National Emergencies Act (50 <ent type='ORG'>USC</ent> <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>.
  1601), confers special powers in time of war or national emergency.
  He can invoke those special powers simply by declaring a national
  emergency.  First, however, he must specify the legal provisions under
  which he proposes that he, or other officers, will act.  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> may
  end a national emergency by enacting a joint resolution.  Once invoked
  by the president, emergency powers are directed by the National
  Security Council and administered, where appropriate, under the
  general umbrella of <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Emergency Management <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent></ent> (<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>).[1]
  There is no requirement that <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> be consulted before an emergency
  is declared or findings signed.  The only restriction on Bush is that
  he must inform <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> in a "timely" fashion--he being the sole
  arbiter of timeliness.
 Ultimately, the president's perception of the severity of a
  particular threat to national <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity and the integrity of his
  appointed officers determine the nature of any state of emergency.
  For this reason, those who were aware of the modern development of
  presidential emergency powers were apprehensive about the domestic
  ramifications of any national emergency declared by George Bush.  In
  light of Bush's record (see "Bush Chips Away at Constitution" Box
  below) and present performance, their fears appear well-founded.</p>

<p>  The War at Home
 It is too early to know all of the emergency powers, executive
  orders and findings issued under classified National Security
  Directives[2] implemented by Bush in the name of the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> War.  In
  addition to the emergency powers necessary to the direct mobilization
  of active and reserve armed forces of <ent type='GPE'>the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent>, there are
  some 120 additional emergency powers that can be used in a national
  emergency or state of war (declared or undeclared by <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>).  The
  "<ent type='ORG'>Federal Register</ent>" records some 15 <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Orders</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>EO</ent>) signed by
  Bush from August 21990 to February 141991.  (See "Bush's <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent>
  Orders" box, below)
 It may take many years before most of the executive findings and
  use of powers come to light, if indeed they ever do.  But evidence is
  emerging that at least some of Bush's emergency powers were activated
  in <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ret.  Although only five of the 15 <ent type='ORG'>EO</ent>s that were published were
  directed at non-military personnel, the costs directly attributable to
  the exercise of the authorities conferred by the declaration of
  national emergency from August 2, 1990 to February 1, 1991 for non-
  military activities are estimated at approximately $1.3 billion.
  According to a February 11, 1991 letter from Bush to congressional
  leaders reporting on the "<ent type='ORG'>National Emergency With Respect</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>,"
  these costs represent wage and salary costs for the Departments of
  <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>, Agriculture, and Transportation, U.S. Customs,
  <ent type='ORG'>Federal Reserve Board</ent>, and <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>National Security Council</ent></ent>.[3]
 The fact that $1.3 billion was spent in non-military salaries alone
  in this six month period suggests an unusual amount of government
  resources utilized to direct the national emergency state.  In
  <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>st, government salaries for one year of the state of emergency
  with <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>[4] cost only $430000.</p>

<p>   ____________________________________________________________________
   |      |
   |   Bush Chips Away at Constitution    |
   |      |
   |  George Bush, perhaps more than any other individual in  |
   | U.S. history, has expanded the emergency powers of   |
   | presidency.  In 1976, as Director of <ent type='ORG'>Central Intelligence</ent>,   |
   | he convened Team B, a group of rabidly anti-<ent type='NORP'>communist</ent>  |
   | intellectuals and former government officials to reevaluate  |
   | <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> inhouse intelligence estimates on <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> military  |
   | strength.  The resulting report recommended draconian civil  |
   | defense measures which led to President Ford's <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> |
   | Order 11921 authorizing plans to establish government  |
   | control of the means of production, distribution, energy |
   | sources, wages and salaries, credit and the flow of money  |
   | in U.S. financial institutions in a national emergency.[1]   |
   |  As Vice President, Bush headed <ent type='ORG'>the Task Force</ent> on  |
   | Combatting Terrorism, that recommended:  extended and  |
   | flexible emergency presidential powers to combat terrorism;  |
   | restrictions on congressional oversight in counter-    |
   | terrorist planning;  and curbing press coverage of   |
   | terrorist incidents.[2]  The report gave rise to the Anti-   |
   | Terrorism Act of 1986, that granted the President clear-cut  |
   | authority to respond to terrorism with all appropriate   |
   | means including deadly force.  It authorized the   |
   | <ent type='ORG'>Immigration and Naturalization Service</ent> to control and  |
   | remove not only alien terrorists but potential terrorist |
   | aliens and those "who are likely to be supportive of   |
   | terrorist activity within the U.S."[3]  The bill superceded  |
   | the War Powers Act by imposing no time limit on the    |
   | President's use of force in a terrorist situation, and   |
   | lifted the requirement that the President consult <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>   |
   | before sanctioning deadly force.   |
   |  From 1982 to 1988, Bush led the <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Mobilization  |
   | Planning Systems <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>DMPSA</ent>), a <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ret government   |
   | organization, and spent more than $3 billion upgrading   |
   | command, control, and communications in <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>'s continuity  |
   | of government infrastructures.  <ent type='ORG'>Continuity of Government</ent> |
   | (<ent type='ORG'>COG</ent>) was ostensibly created to assure government  |
   | functioning during war, especially nuclear war.  The <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>  |
   | was so <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ret that even many members of the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> were  |
   | unaware of its existence and most of its work was done   |
   | without congressional oversight.   |
   |  Project 908, as the <ent type='ORG'>DMPSA</ent> was sometimes called, was |
   | similar to its parent agency <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> in that it came under  |
   | investigation for mismanagement and <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>ct   |
   | irregularities.[4]  During this same period, <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> had been   |
   | fraught with scandals including emergency planning with a  |
   | distinctly anti-constitutional flavor.  The agency would |
   | have sidestepped <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and other federal agencies and |
   | put the President and <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> directly in charge of the U.S.  |
   | planning for martial rule.  Under this state, the executive  |
   | would take upon itself powers far beyond those necessary to  |
   | address national emergency contingencies.[5]   |
   |  Bush's "anything goes" anti-drug strategy, announced  |
   | on September 6, 1989, suggested that executive emergency |
   | powers be used:  to oust those suspected of associating  |
   | with drug users or sellers from public and private housing;  |
   | to mobilize <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>National Guard</ent></ent> and U.S. military to fight  |
   | drugs in the continental U.S.;  to confiscate private  |
   | property belonging to drug users, and to incarcerate first   |
   | time offenders in work camps.[6]   |
   |  The record of Bush's fast and loose approach to   |
   | constitutionally guaranteed civil rights is a history of |
   | the erosion of liberty and the consolidation of an imperial  |
   | executive.       |

<p> Even those <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Orders</ent> which have been made public tend to
  raise as many questions as they answer about what actions were
  considered and actually implemented.  On January 8, 1991, Bush signed
  <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Order 12742, National Security Industrial Responsiveness,
  which ordered the rapid mobilization of resources such as food,
  energy, construction materials and civil transportation to meet
  national <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity requirements.  There was, however, no mention in
  this or any other <ent type='ORG'>EO</ent> of the National <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Reserve (<ent type='ORG'>NDER</ent>)
  plan administered under <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>.  This plan, which had been activated
  during World War II and the Korean War, permits the federal government
  during a state of emergency to bring into government certain
  unidentified individuals.  On January 7, 1991 the "Wall Street Journal
  <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>" reported that industry and government officials were studying
  a plan which would permit the federal government to "borrow" as many
  as 50 oil company executives and put them to work streamlining the
  flow of energy in case of a prolonged engagement or disruption of
  supply.  <ent type='ORG'>Antitrust</ent> waivers were also being pursued and oil companies
  were engaged in emergency preparedness exercises with the Department
  of Energy.[5]</p>

<p>  Wasting the Environment
 In one case the use of <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ret powers was discovered by a watchdog
  group and revealed in the press.  In August 1990, correspondence
  passed between Colin McMillan, Assistant Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> for
  Production and Logistics and Michael Deland, Chair of the White <ent type='ORG'>House</ent>
  <ent type='ORG'>Council on Environmental Quality</ent>.  The letters responded to
  presidential and <ent type='ORG'>National Security Council</ent> directives to deal with
  increased industrial production and logistics arising from the
  situation in <ent type='LOC'>the <ent type='LOC'>Middle East</ent></ent>.  The communications revealed that the
  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> had found it necessary to request emergency waivers to U.S.
  environmental restrictions.[6]
 The agreement to waive <ent type='ORG'>the National Environmental Policy Act</ent> (1970)
  came in August.  Because of it, the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> was allowed to test new
  weapons in the western U.S., increase production of materiel and
  launch new activities at military bases without the complex public
  review normally required.  The information on the waiver was
  eventually released by the <ent type='GPE'>Boston</ent>-based <ent type='ORG'>National Toxic Campaign Fund</ent>
  (<ent type='ORG'>NTCF</ent>), an environmental group which investigates pollution on the
  nation's military bases.  It was not until January 30, 1991, five
  months after it went into effect, that the "<ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>," acting
  on the <ent type='ORG'>NTCF</ent> information, reported that the White <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> had bypassed
  the usual legal requirement for environmental impact statements on
  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> projects.[7]  So far, no specific executive order or
  presidential finding authorizing this waiver has been discovered.
 Other environmental waivers could also have been enacted without
  the public being informed.  Under a state of national emergency, U.S.
  warships can be exempted from international conventions on
  pollution[8] and public vessels can be allowed to dispose of
  potentially infectious medical wastes into the oceans.[9]  The
  President can also suspend any of the statutory provisions regarding
  the production, testing, transportation, deployment, and disposal of
  chemical and biological warfare agents (50 <ent type='ORG'>USC</ent> <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>. 1515).  He could
  also defer destruction of up to 10 percent of lethal chemical agents
  and munitions that existed on November 8, 1985.[10]
 One <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Order which was made public dealt with "<ent type='ORG'>Chemical</ent> and
  Biological Weapons Proliferation."  Signed by Bush on November 16,
  1990, <ent type='ORG'>EO</ent> 12735 leaves the impression that Bush is ordering an
  increased effort to end the proliferation of chemical and biological
  weapons.  The order states that these weapons "constitute a threat to
  national <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity and foreign policy" and declares a national
  emergency to deal with the threat.  To confront this threat, Bush
  ordered international negotiations, the imposition of controls,
  licenses, and sanctions against foreign persons and countries for
  proliferation.  Conveniently, the order grants the Secretaries of
  <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent> the power to exempt the U.S. military.
 In February of 1991, the <ent type='ORG'>Omni</ent>bus Export Amendments Act was passed
  by <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> compatible with <ent type='ORG'>EO</ent> 12735.  It imposed sanctions on
  countries and companies developing or using chemical or biological
  weapons.  Bush signed the law, although he had rejected the identical
  measure the year before because it did not give him the executive
  power to waive all sanctions if he thought the national interest
  required it.[11]  The new bill, however, met Bush's requirements.</p>

<p>  Going Off Budget
 Although some of the powers which Bush assumed in order to conduct
  the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> War were taken openly, they received little public discussion
  or reporting by the media.
 In October, when the winds of the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> War were merely a breeze,
  Bush used his executive emergency powers to extend his budget
  authority.  This action made the 1991 fiscal budget agreement between
  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and the President one of the first U.S. casualties of the
  war.  While on one hand the deal froze arms spending through 1996, it
  also allowed Bush to put the cost of the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> War "off budget."  Thus,
  using its emergency powers, the Bush administration could:</p>

<p> * incur a deficit which exceeds congressional budget authority;</p>

<p> * prevent <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> from raising a point of order over the
   excessive spending;[12]</p>

<p> * waive the requirement that the Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> submit
   estimates to <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> prior to deployment of a major defense
   acquisition system;</p>

<p> * and exempt the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> from congressional restrictions on
   hiring private <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>ctors.[13]</p>

<p> While there is no published evidence on which powers Bush actually
  invoked, the administration was able to push through the 1990 <ent type='ORG'>Omni</ent>bus
  Reconciliation Act.  This legislation put a cap on domestic spending,
  created a record $300 billion deficit, and undermined the Gramm-
  Rudman-Hollings Act intended to reduce the federal deficit.  Although
  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> agreed to pay for the war through supplemental appropriations
  and approved a $42.2 billion supplemental bill and a $4.8 billion
  companion "dire emergency supplemental appropriation,"[14] it
  specified that the supplemental budget should not be used to finance
  costs the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> would normally experience.[15]
 Lawrence Korb, a <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> official in the Reagan administration,
  believes that the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> has already violated the spirit of the 1990
  <ent type='ORG'>Omni</ent>bus Reconciliation Act.  It switched funding for the <ent type='ORG'>Patriot</ent>,
  Tomahawk, Hellfire and <ent type='ORG'>HARM</ent> missiles from its regular budget to the
  supplemental budget;  added normal wear and tear of equipment to
  supplemental appropriations;  and made supplemental requests which
  ignore a planned 25% reduction in the armed forces by 1995.[16]</p>

<p>  The Cost In Liberty Lost
 Under emergency circumstances, using 50 <ent type='ORG'>USC</ent> <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>. 1811, the
  President could direct the Attorney General to authorize electronic
  surveillance of aliens and <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n citizens in order to obtain
  foreign intelligence information without a court order.[17]  No
  <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Order has been published which activates emergency powers to
  wiretap or to engage in counter-terrorist activity.  Nonetheless,
  there is substantial evidence that such activities have taken place.
  According to the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>-based Center for Constitutional Rights, the
  <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> launched an anti-terrorist campaign which included a broad sweep
  of Arab-<ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent>.  Starting in August, the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> questioned, detained,
  and harassed Arab-<ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Ohio</ent>,
  <ent type='GPE'>Penn</ent>sylvania, <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Maryland</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent>.[18]
 A <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agent asked the University of <ent type='GPE'>Connecticut</ent> for a list of all
  foreign students at the institution, along with their country of
  origin, major field of study, and the names of their academic
  advisers.  He was particularly interested in students from the Middle
  East and explained that the <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> intended to open a file on each of
  the students.  Anti-war groups have also reported several break-ins of
  their offices and many suspected electronic surveillance of their
  telephones.[19]</p>

<p>  Pool of Disinformation
 Emergency powers to control the means of communications in the U.S.
  in the name of national <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity were never formally declared.  There
  was no need for Bush to do so since most of the media voluntarily and
  even eagerly cooperated in their own censorship.  Reporters covering
  the Coalition forces in the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> region operated under restrictions
  imposed by the U.S. military.  They were, among other things, barred
  from traveling without a military escort, limited in their forays into
  the field to small escorted groups called "pools," and required to
  submit all reports and film to military censors for clearance.  Some
  reporters complained that the rules limited their ability to gather
  information independently, thereby obstructing informed and objective
  reporting.[20]
 Three <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> press officials in the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> region admitted to James
  LeMoyne of the "<ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>" that they spent significant time
  analyzing reporters' stories in order to shape the coverage in the
  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>'s favor.  In the early days of the deployment, <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> press
  officers warned reporters who asked hard questions that they were seen
  as "anti-military" and that their requests for interviews with senior
  commanders and visits to the field were in jeopardy.  The military
  often staged events solely for the cameras and would stop televised
  interviews in progress when it did not like what was being portrayed.
 Although filed soon after the beginning of the war, a lawsuit
  challenging the constitutionality of press restrictions was not heard
  until after the war ended.  It was then dismissed when the judge ruled
  that since the war had ended, the issues raised had become moot.  The
  legal status of the restrictions--initially tested during the U.S.
  invasions of <ent type='GPE'>Grenada</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>--remains unsettled.</p>

<p>  A National Misfortune
 It will be years before researchers and journalists are able to
  ferret through the maze of government documents and give a full
  appraisal of the impact of the President's emergency powers on
  domestic affairs.  It is likely, however, that with a post-war
  presidential approval rating exceeding 75 percent, the domestic
  casualties will continue to mount with few objections.  Paradoxically,
  even though the U.S. public put pressure on Bush to send relief for
  the 500000 <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>i <ent type='NORP'>Kurdish</ent> refugees, it is unlikely the same outcry
  will be heard for the 37 million <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent> without health insurance,
  the 32 million living in poverty, or the country's five million hungry
  children.  The U.S. may even help rebuild <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>i and <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>i civilian
  infrastructures it destroyed during the war while leaving its own
  education system in decay, domestic transportation infrastructures
  crumbling, and inner city war zones uninhabitable.  And, while the
  U.S. assists <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent> in cleaning up its environmental disaster, it will
  increase pollution at home.  Indeed, as the long-dead <ent type='NORP'>Prussian</ent> field
  marshal prophesied, "a war, even the most victorious, is a national
  misfortune."</p>

   <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ure and remove all subjects of a hostile nation over 13 years old.
   Other statutes conferring special powers on the President with regard
   to aliens that may be exercised in times of war or emergencies but are
   not confined to such circumstances, are:  exclusion of all or certain
   classes of aliens from entry into the U.S. when their entry may be
   "detrimental to the interests of <ent type='GPE'>the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent>" (8 <ent type='ORG'>USC</ent> <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>. 1182(f));

<p>[Oliver] <ent type='ORG'>North</ent> managed to network himself into the highest levels of
the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and power centers around the world.  There he lied and
boastfully ignored the constitutional process, Bradlee writes.</p>

<p>Yet more terrifying is the plan hatched by <ent type='ORG'>North</ent> and other Reagan
people in the Federal Emergency Manpower <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>): A blueprint
for the military takeover of <ent type='GPE'>the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent>.  The plan called for
<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> to become ``emergency czar'' in the event of a national emergency
such as nuclear war or an <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n invasion of a foreign nation.  <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>
would also be a buffer between the president and his cabinet and other
civilian agencies, and would have broad powers to appoint military
commanders and run state and local governments.  Finally, it would
have the authority to order suspect aliens into <ent type='ORG'>concentra</ent>tion camps
and seize their property.</p>

<p>When then-Attorney General William <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> Smith got wind of the plan,
he killed it.  After Smith left the administration, <ent type='ORG'>North</ent> and his <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>
cronies came up with the <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Resource Act, designed to suspendend
the First Amendment by imposing censorship and banning strikes.</p>

<p>Where was it all heading?  The book's answer: ``<ent type='ORG'>REX</ent>-84 Bravo, a
<ent type='ORG'>National Security Decision Directive</ent> 52 that would become operative
with the president's declaration of a state of national emergency
concurrent with a mythical U.S. military invasion of an unspecified
Central <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n country, presumably <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>.''</p>

<p>Bradlee writes that the Rex exercise was designed to test <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>'s
readiness to assume authority over the Department of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>, the
<ent type='ORG'>National Guard</ent> in all 50 states, and ``a number of state defense
forces to be established by state legislatures.''  The military would
then be ``deputized,'' thus making an end run around federal law
forbidding military involvement in domestic law enforcement.</p>

<p>Rex, which ran concurrently with the first annual U.S. show of force
in <ent type='GPE'>Honduras</ent> in April 1984, was also designed to test <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>'s ability to
round up 400000 undocumented Central <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n aliens in the United
<ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s and its ability to distribute hundreds of tons of small arms to
``state defense forces.''</p>

<p>Incredibly, <ent type='ORG'>REX</ent> 84 was similar to a plan <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>retly adopted by Reagan
while governor of <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>.  His two top henchmen then were Edwin
Meese, who recently resigned as U.S. attorney general, and Louis
Guiffrida, the <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> director in 1984.</p>

This is the front-page article of the Jan. 16 issue of "The
<ent type='ORG'>Guardian</ent>," which describes some of the U.S. government's planning
for martial law in the event of the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> war. This is truly a
scary scenario that should concern all civil libertarians and
patriots.
------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p> WILL GULF WAR LEAD TO REPRESSION AT HOME?
 by Paul DeRienzo and Bill Weinberg</p>

<p>On August 2, 1990, as Saddam Hussein's army was consolidating control
over <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>, President George Bush responded by signing two executive
orders that were the first step toward martial law in the United
<ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s and suspending the Constitution.</p>

<p>On the surface, <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Orders</ent> 12722 and 12723, declaring a
"national emergency," merely invoked laws that allowed Bush to freeze
<ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>i assets in <ent type='GPE'>the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent>.</p>

<p>The International Emergency <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Powers Act permits the president
to freeze foreign assets after declaring a "national emergency," a
move that has been made three times before -- against <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent> in 1987,
<ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent> in 1985 and <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> in 1979.</p>

<p>According to Professor Diana <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent>, of the Fletcher School of
Diplomacy at <ent type='GPE'>Boston</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>Tufts University</ent>, when Bush declared a national
emergency he "activated one part of a contingency national <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity
emergency plan." That plan is made up of a series of laws passed since
the presidency of Richard Nixon, which <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent> says give the
president "boundless" powers.</p>

<p>According to <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent>, such laws as the <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Industrial
Revitalization and Disaster Relief Acts of 1983 "would permit the
president to do anything from seizing the means of production, to
conscripting a labor force, to relocating groups of citizens."</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent> says the net effect of invoking these laws would be the
suspension of the Constitution.</p>

<p>She adds that national emergency powers "permit the stationing of the
military in cities and towns, closing off the U.S. borders, freezing
all imports and exports, allocating all resources on a national
<ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity priority, monitoring and censoring the press, and warrantless
searches and seizures."</p>

<p>The measures would allow military authorities to proclaim martial law
in <ent type='GPE'>the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent>, asserts <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent>. She defines martial law as the
"federal authority taking over for local authority when they are
unable to maintain law and order or to assure a <ent type='NORP'>republican</ent> form of
government."</p>

<p>A report called "<ent type='ORG'>Post Attack Recovery Strategies</ent>," about rebuilding
the country after a nuclear war, prepared by the right-wing Hudson
Institute in 1980, defines martial law as dealing "with the control of
civilians by their own military forces in time of emergency."</p>

<p>The federal agency with the authority to organize and command the
government's response to a national emergency is the Federal Emergency
Management <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>). This super-<ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ret and elite agency was
formed in 1979 under congressional measures that merged all federal
powers dealing with civilian and military emergencies under one
agency.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> has its roots in the World War I partnership between government
and corporate leaders who helped mobilize the nation's industries to
support the war effort. The idea of a central national response to
large-scale emergencies was reintroduced in the early 1970s by Louis
Giuffrida, a close associate of then-<ent type='GPE'>California</ent> Gov. Ronald Reagan and
his chief aide Edwin Meese.</p>

<p>Reagan appointed Giuffrida head of the <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> <ent type='ORG'>National Guard</ent> in
1969. With Meese, Giuffrida organized "war-games" to prepare for
"statewide martial law" in the event that Black nationalists and
anti-war protesters "challenged the authority of the state."  In 1981,
Reagan as president moved Giuffrida up to the big leagues, appointing
him director of <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>.</p>

<p>According to <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent>, however, it was the actions of George Bush in
1976, while he was the director of the <ent type='ORG'>Central Intelligence</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>
(<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>), that provided the stimulus for centralization of vast powers in
<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>.</p>

<p>Bush assembled a group of hawkish outsiders, called Team B, that
released a report claiming the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> ("Team A") had underestimated the
dangers of <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> nuclear attack. The report advised the development
of elaborate plans for "civil defense" and post-nuclear government.
Three years later, in 1979, <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> was given ultimate responsibility for
developing these plans.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Aware of the</ent> bad publicity <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> was getting because of its role in
organizing for a post-nuclear world, Reagan's <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> chief Giuffrida
publicly argued that the 1865 Posse Comitatus Act prohibited the
military from arresting civilians.</p>

<p>However, <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent> says that <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> eroded the act by giving the
military reserves an exemption from Posse Comitatus and allowing them
to arrest civilians. <ent type='ORG'>The <ent type='ORG'>National Guard</ent></ent>, under the control of state
governors in peace time, is also exempt from the act and can arrest
civilians.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> Inspector General John Brinkerhoff has written a memo contending
that the government doesn't need to suspend the Constitution to use
the full range of powers <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> has given the agency. <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> has
prepared legislation to be introduced in <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> in the event of a
national emergency that would give the agency sweeping powers. The
right to "deputize" <ent type='ORG'>National Guard</ent> and police forces is included in
the package. But <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent> believes that actual martial law need not be
declared publicly.</p>

<p>Giuffrida has written that "Martial Rule comes into existence upon a
determination (not a declaration) by the senior military commander
that the civil government must be replaced because it is no longer
functioning anyway." He adds that "Martial Rule is limited only by the
principle of necessary force."</p>

<p>According to <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent>, it is possible for the president to make
declarations concerning a national emergency <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>retly in the form of a
Natioanl Security Decision Directive. Most such directives are
classified as so <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ret that <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent> says "researchers don't even
know how many are enacted."</p>

<p>DOMESTIC SPYING</p>

<p>Throughout the 1980s, <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> was prohibited from engaging in
intelligence gathering. But on July 6, 1989, Bush signed <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent>
Order 12681, pronouncing that <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>National Preparedness Directorate</ent>
would "have as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence,
investigative, or national <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity work." Recent events indicate that
domestic spying in response to the looming <ent type='LOC'>Middle East</ent> war is now
under way.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent> reports that "the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> is going to various campuses asking for
information on <ent type='LOC'>Middle East</ent>ern students. I'm sure that there are
intelligence organizations monitoring peace demonstrations."
According to the University of <ent type='GPE'>Connecticut</ent> student paper, the Daily
Campus, <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> officials have recently met there to discuss talking with
<ent type='LOC'>Middle East</ent>ern students.</p>

<p>The <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent> reports that the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> has ordered its agents around
the country to question Arab-<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n leaders and business people in
search of information on potential <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>i "terrorist" attacks in
response to a <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> war.</p>

<p>A 1986 <ent type='ORG'>Immigration and Naturalization Service</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>INS</ent>) document entitled
"Alien Terrorists and Other Undesirables: A Contingency Plan" outlines
the potential round-up and incarceration in mass detainment camps of
U.S. residents who are citizens of "terrorist" countries, chiefly in
<ent type='LOC'>the <ent type='LOC'>Middle East</ent></ent>. This plan echoed a 1984 <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> nationwide "readiness
exercise code-named <ent type='ORG'>REX</ent>-84 ALPHA, which included the rehearsal of
joint operations with the <ent type='ORG'>INS</ent> to round up 40000 Central <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n
refugees in the event of a U.S. invasion of the region. One of the 10
military bases established as detainment camps by <ent type='ORG'>REX</ent>-84 ALPHA, Camp
Krome, <ent type='GPE'>Fla</ent>., was designated a joint <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>-Immigration service
interrogation center.</p>

<p>Recently, <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> has been criticized in the media for inadequate
response to the October, 1989 <ent type='GPE'>San Francisco</ent> earthquake. What the
mainstream press has failed to cover is the agency's planned role in
repressing domestic dissent in the event of an invasion abroad.</p>

<p>   The  mountains bend as the fjord and the sea beyond  stretch
out before the viewer's eyes.  First over the water, then a sharp
left  turn,  then a bank to the right between the peaks,  and the
<ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ret naval base unfolds upon the screen.
   The  scene is of a <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> military installation on the  Kola
Peninsula in the icy <ent type='LOC'>Barents Sea</ent>,  a place usually off-limits  to
the gaze of the <ent type='NORP'>Western</ent> world.  It was captured by a small <ent type='NORP'>French</ent>
satellite called SPOT Image, orbiting at an altitude of 517 miles
above  the hidden <ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent> outpost. On each of several passes --
made  over a two-week period last fall -- the  satellite's  high-
resolution  lens  took  its pictures at a  different  angle;  the
images  were  then blended into  a  three-dimensional,  computer-
generated video. Buildings,  docks, vessels, and details of the
Artic landscape are all clearly visible.
   Half  a  world  away and thousands of feet  under  the  sea,
sparkling-clear images are being made of the ocean floor. Using
the  latest bathymetric technology and  state-of-the-art  systems
known as <ent type='ORG'>Seam Beam</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Hydrochart</ent>,  researchers are for the first
time  assembling  detailed  underwater maps  of  the  continental
shelves  and the depths of the world's oceans. These scenes  of
the  sea  are as sophisticated as the photographs taken from  the
satellite.
   From  the three-dimensional images taken far above the earth
to  the charts of the bottom of the  oceans,  these  photographic
systems  have  three  things in common: They both rely  on  the
latest  technology to create accurate pictures never  dreamed  of
even  25  years  ago;  they are being made  widely  available  by
commerical,  nongovernmental  enterprises;  and  the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>  is
trying desperately to keep them from the general public.
   In  1985 the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> classified the underwater  charts,  making
them  available  only  to approved researchers  whose  needs  are
evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Under a 1984 law the military
has  been given a say in what cameras can be licensed to be  used
on <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n satellites; and officials have already announced they
plan  to  limit  the  quality  and  resolution  of  photos made
available. The National Security <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>) -- the <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ret arm
of the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> in charge of gathering electronic intelligence as
well as protecting sensitive U.S.  communications -- has defeated
a move to keep it away from civilian and commercial computers and
databases.
   That attitude  has  outraged  those  concerned  with the
military's  increasing efforts to keep information not only  from
the public but from industry experts,  scientists, and even other
government  officials as well. "That's like classifying a  road
map for fear  of  invasion,"  says  Paul Wolff, assistant
administrator for the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, of the attempted restrictions.
   These attempts to keep unclassified data out of the hands of
scientists,  researchers, the news media, and the public at large
are  a part of an alarming trend that has seen the military  take
an  ever-increasing  role in controlling the flow of  information
and communications through <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n society, a role traditionally
-- and  almost  exclusively  -- left  to  civilians. Under  the
approving  gaze  of  the  Reagan  administration,  Department  of
<ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>  (<ent type='ORG'>DoD</ent>)  officials have quietly implemented  a  number  of
policies, decisions, and orders  that  give  the military
unprecedented  control  over both the content and public  use  of
data and communications.  For example:</p>

<p>**The  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>  has  created a new category of  "sensitive"  but
unclassified  information  that  allows it to  keep  from  public
access huge quantities of data that were once widely accessible.
**<ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Department officials have attempted to rewrite key laws
that  spell  out when the president can  and  cannot  appropriate
private communications facilities.
**The  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>  has installed a system that enables it to  seize
control  of  the nation's entire  communications  network  -- the
phone system,  data transmissions, and satellite transmissions of
all kinds  -- in  the  event  of  what  it  deems  a  "national
emergency."  As yet there is no single,  universally  agreed-upon
definition  of  what constitutes such a state. Usually such  an
emergency  is restricted to times of natural  disaster,  war,  or
when  national  <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity is  specifically  threatened. Now  the
military has attempted to redefine emergency.
   The  point man in the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>'s onslaught on communications
is  Assistant <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Secretary Donald C.  Latham,  a former  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>
deputy  chief. Latham now heads up an interagency committee  in
charge of writing and implementing many of the policies that have
put  the military in charge of the flow of  civilian  information
and communication.  He is also the architect of National Security
Decision  Directive 145 (<ent type='ORG'>NSDD</ent> 145),  signed by <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>  Secretary
Caspar Weinberger in 1984,  which sets out the national policy on
telecommunications and computer-systems <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity.
   First  <ent type='ORG'>NSDD</ent>  145  set  up  a  steering  group  of  top-level
administration  officials. Their job is to  recommend  ways  to
protect information that is unclassified but has been  designated
sensitive. Such  information  is held not  only  by  government
agencies but by private companies as well.  And last October  the
steering  group  issued  a  memorandum  that  defined sensitive
information and gave federal agencies broad new powers to keep it
from the public.
   According to Latham, this new category includes such data as
all medical records on government databases -- from the files  of
<ent type='ORG'>the National Cancer Institute</ent> to information on every veteran who
has ever applied for medical aid from <ent type='ORG'>the Veterans Administration</ent>
-- and all the information on corporate and personal taxpayers in
the  Internal  Revenue Service's  computers. Even  agricultural
statistics, he argues, can be used by a foreign power against the
United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s.
   In  his  oversize yet Spartan <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> office,  Latham  cuts
anything but an intimidating figure.  <ent type='ORG'>Articulate</ent> and friendly, he
could  pass  for a network anchorman or a  television  game  show
host.  When  asked  how  the  government's  new  definition  of
sensitive information will be used,  he defends the necessity for
it and tries to put to rest concerns about a new restrictiveness.
   "The  debate  that  somehow  the <ent type='ORG'>DoD</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>  are  going  to
monitor  or  get into private databases isn't the case  at  all,"
Latham  insists. "The definition is just a guideline,  just  an
advisory. It does not give the <ent type='ORG'>DoD</ent> the right to go into private
records."
   Yet  the <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Department invoked the <ent type='ORG'>NSDD</ent> 145  guidelines
when it told the information industry it intends to restrict  the
sale  of  data that are now unclassified and  publicly  available
from privately owned computer systems.  The excuse if offered was
that these data often include technical information that might be
valuable to a foreign adversary like the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union.
   <ent type='ORG'>Mead Data Central</ent> -- which runs some of the nation's largest
computer  databases,  such  as Lexis and <ent type='ORG'>Nexis</ent>,  and  has  nearly
200000 users -- says it has already been approached by a team of
agents  from <ent type='ORG'>the Air Force</ent> and officials from the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>
who  asked  for the names of subscribers and inquired  what  Mead
officials might do if information restrictions were imposed. In
response  to  government pressure,  <ent type='ORG'>Mead Data Central</ent>  in  effect
censured itself.  It purged all unclassified  government-supplied
technical  data  from  its  system  and  completely  dropped  the
National  Technical Information System from its  database  rather
than risk a confrontation.
   Representative Jack <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent>,  a <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent> who chairs the
<ent type='ORG'>House</ent> Government Operations Committee,  is an outspoken critic of
the  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>'s  role in restricting civilian information. He  notes
that  in 1985 the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent> -- under the authority granted by <ent type='ORG'>NSDD</ent>  145
-- investigated  a computer program that was widely used in  both
local  and federal elections in 1984. The computer  system  was
used to count more than one third of all votes cast in the United
<ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s. While  probing  the system's vulnerability  to  outside
manipulation,  the  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>  obtained  a detailed knowledge  of  that
computer  program. "In  my  view," <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent>  says,  "this  is  an
unprecedented and  ill-advised  expansion  of  the military's
influence in our society."
   There are other <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent> critics. "The computer systems used by
counties  to  collect and process votes have nothing to  do  with
national  <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity,  and  I'm really concerned  about  the  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>'s
involvement," says <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>ic congressman Dan Glickman of <ent type='GPE'>Kansas</ent>,
chairman  of  the  <ent type='ORG'>House</ent>  science  and  technology subcommittee
concerned with computer <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity.
   Also,  under  <ent type='ORG'>NSDD</ent>  145 the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> has  issued  an  order,
virtually  unknown  to all  but a few industry  executives,  that
affects  commercial communications satellites. The  policy  was
made official by <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Secretary Weinberger in June of 1985 and
requires  that all commercial satellite operators that carry such
unclassified  government data traffic as routine <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>  supply
information  and  payroll data (and that  compete  for  lucrative
government  <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>cts)  install costly protective systems on  all
satellites  launched after 1990. The policy does  not  directly
affect the data over satellite channels, but it does make the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>
privy  to vital information about the essential signals needed to
operate a satellite.  With this information it could take control
of any satellite it chooses.
   Latham  insists this,  too,  is a voluntary policy and  that
only  companies that wish to install protection will  have  their
systems  evaluated by the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>. He also says industry  officials
are  wholly  behind  the move,  and argues  that  the  protective
systems  are necessary.  With just a few thousand dollars'  worth
of  equipment,  a  disgruntled employee could  interfere  with  a
satellite's  control  signals  and disable or  even  wipe  out  a
hundred-million-dollar satellite carrying government information.
   At best,  his comments are misleading.  First, the policy is
not  voluntary.  The  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>  can  cut  off  lucrative  government
<ent type='NORP'>contra</ent>cts  to companies that do not comply with  the  plan. The
<ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> alone  spent  more  than  a  billion  dollars  leasing
commercial  satellite  channels  last  year;  that's  a  powerful
incentive for business to cooperate.
   Second,  the  industry's  support  is  anything  but  total.
According  to the minutes of one closed-door meeting between  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>
officials -- along with representatives of other federal agencies
--  and  executives from AT&amp;T, <ent type='ORG'>Comsat</ent>, <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>GTE</ent> Sprint</ent>, and  <ent type='ORG'>MCI</ent>,  the
executives  neither  supported  the  move  nor  believed  it  was
necessary. The  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>  defended  the policy  by  arguing  that  a
satellite  could  be held for ransom if the command  and  control
links  weren't  protected. But  experts  at  the  meeting  were
skeptical.
   "Why is the threat limited to accessing the satellite rather
than  destroying  it  with lasers or high-powered  signals?"  one
industry executive wanted to know.
   Most  of the officials present objected to the high cost  of
protecting the satellites.  According to a 1983 study made at the
request of the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>, the protection demanded by the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent> could
add  as  much as $3 million to the price of a  satellite  and  $1
million  more to annual operating costs.  Costs like these,  they
argue,  could cripple a company competing against less  expensive
communications networks.
   <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent>  get  much of their information through  forms  of
electronic  communications,  from the telephone,  television  and
radio,  and information printed in many newspapers. <ent type='ORG'>Banks  </ent>send
important  financial  data,  businesses their  spreadsheets,  and
stockbrokers  their  investment portfolios,  all  over  the  same
channels,  from  satellite signals to computer hookups carried on
long  distance telephone lines. To make sure that  the  federal
government  helped  to promote and protect the efficient  use  of
this advancing technology, <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>  passed the massive
Communications Act of of 1934. It outlined the role and laws of
the communications structure in <ent type='GPE'>the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent>.
   The  powers  of the president are set out in Section 606  of
that law;  basically it states that he has the authority to  take
control of  any  communications  facilities  that  he  believes
"essential  to  the national defense."  In the  language  of  the
trade this is known as a 606 emergency.
   There  have  been  a number of attempts in recent  years  by
<ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Department officials to redefine what qualifies as a  606
emergency  and  make  it  easier for the military  to  take  over
national communications.
   In  1981  the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> considered amendments to the  1934  act
that would allow  the  president, on <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Department
recommendation,  to require any communications company to provide
services,  facilities,  or  equipment  "to promote  the  national
defense  and  <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity  or  the  emergency  preparedness  of  the
nation,"  even  in  peacetime and without  a  declared  state  of
emergency. The  general  language had been drafted  by  <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>
Department  officials. (The  bill failed to pass the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent>  for
unrelated reasons.)
   "I  think  it is quite clear that they have snuck  in  there
some  powers that are dangerous for us as a company and  for  the
public  at large," said <ent type='ORG'>MCI</ent> vice president Kenneth Cox before the
<ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> vote.
   Since President Reagan took office, the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> has stepped
up  its  efforts to rewrite the definition of national  emergency
and give the military expanded powers in <ent type='GPE'>the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent>.  "The
declaration  of  'emergency'  has always been  vague,"  says  one
former  administration official who left the government  in  1982
after ten years in top policy posts. "Different presidents have
invoked  it  differently. This administration would  declare  a
convenient 'emergency.'" In other words,  what is a nuisance to
one  administration  might  qualify  as a  burgeoning  crisis  to
another. For  example,  the Reagan administration might  decide
that a series of protests on or near military bases constituted a
national emergency.
   Should the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> ever be given the green light,  its base
for  taking  over the nation's communications system would  be  a
nondescript yellow brick building within the maze of high  rises,
government  buildings,  and apartment complexes that make up  the
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>  suburb of <ent type='GPE'>Arlington</ent>,  <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent>. Headquartered in  a
dusty and aging structure surrounded by a barbed-wire fence is an
obscure branch of the  military  known as the <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>
Communications  <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>  (<ent type='ORG'>DCA</ent>). It  does not have the  spit  and
polish  of  the National Security <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> or the dozens  of  other
government facilities that make up the nation's capital.  But its
lack of shine belies its critical mission: to make sure all  of
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s  far-flung  military  units can  communicate  with  one
another. It is in certain ways the nerve center of our nation's
defense system.
   On  the <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ond floor of the <ent type='ORG'>DCA</ent>'s four-story headquarters is
a  new  addition called the National Coordinating  Center  (<ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>).
Operated  by the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>,  it is virtually unknown outside of  a
handful of industry and government officials.  The <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent> is staffed
around  the clock by representatives of a dozen of  the  nation's
largest  commercial  communications  companies  -- the  so-called
"common  carriers" -- including AT&amp;T, <ent type='ORG'>MCI</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>GTE</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Comsat</ent>, and  <ent type='ORG'>ITT</ent>.
Also  on hand are officials from the <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> Department,  the  <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>,
the  Federal  Aviation  Administration, and  a  number  of  other
federal agencies.  During a 606 emergency the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> can  order
the  companies that make up the National Coordinating  Center  to
turn  over their satellite, fiberoptic, and land-line  facilities
to the government.
   On a long corridor in the front of the building is a  series
of offices, each outfitted with a private phone, a telex machine,
and  a combination safe. It's known as "logo row" because  each
office  is occupied by an employee from one of the companies that
staff the <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent> and because their corporate logos hand on the  wall
outside. Each  employee  is  on  permanent  standby,  ready  to
activate his company's system should the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> require it.
   The  <ent type='ORG'>National Coordinating Center</ent>'s mission is as  grand  as
its  title  is  obscure:  to  make  available  to  the  <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>
Department  all  the  facilities of the  civilian  communications
network  in this country -- the phone  lines,  the  long-distance
satellite  hookups,  the  data transmission lines -- in times  of
national  emergency. If war breaks out and communications to  a
key military base are cut,  the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> wants to make sure  that
an  alternate  link can be set up as fast as  possible. <ent type='ORG'>Company</ent>
employees assigned to the center are on call 24 hours a day; they
wear beepers outside the office,  and when on vacation they  must
be replaced by qualified colleagues.
   The center formally opened on New Year's Day, 1984, the same
day  Ma Bell's monopoly over the telephone network of the  entire
United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s was finally broken.  The timing was no coincidence.
<ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>  officials had argued for years along with AT&amp;T  against
the  divestiture  of Ma Bell,  on grounds of  national  <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity.
<ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Secretary  Weinberger  personally  urged  the  attorney
general to block the lawsuit that resulted in the breakup, as had
his predecessor,  Harold Brown. The reason was that rather than
construct its own communications network,  the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> had  come
to rely extensively on the phone company. After the breakup the
dependence continued.  The  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>  still  used  commercial
companies  to  carry more than 90 percent of  its  communications
within the continental United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s.
   The 1984 divestiture put an end to AT&amp;T's monopoly over  the
nation's telephone service and increased the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>'s obsession
with  having its own nerve center. Now the brass had to contend
with  several  competing companies to acquire  phone  lines,  and
communications was more than a matter of running a line from  one
telephone to another.  Satellites, microwave towers, fiberoptics,
and  other  technological  breakthroughs  never  dreamed  of by
Alexander  Graham  Bell were in extensive use, and not  just  for
phone  conversations.  <ent type='ORG'>Digital</ent> data streams for computers  flowed
on the same networks.
   These  facts were not lost on the <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Department or  the
White <ent type='ORG'>House</ent>. According to documents obtained by <ent type='ORG'>Omni</ent>, beginning
on  December  14,  1982,  a number of <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ret meetings  were  held
between high-level administration officials and executives of the
commercial  communications companies whose employees would  later
staff  the  <ent type='ORG'>National Coordinating Center</ent>. The  meetings,  which
continued  over  the next three years,  were held  at  the  White
<ent type='ORG'>House</ent>,  the  <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>  Department,  <ent type='ORG'>the Strategic Air Command</ent>  (<ent type='ORG'>SAC</ent>)
headquarters  at Offutt Air Force Base in <ent type='GPE'>Nebraska</ent>,  and  at  the
<ent type='ORG'>North</ent>  <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n  Aerospace  <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Command (<ent type='ORG'>NORAD</ent>)  in  <ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent>
Springs.
   The  industry officials attending constituted  the  National
Security  Telecommunications  Advisory Committee -- called  NSTAC
(pronounced  N-stack)  -- set up by President Reagan  to  address
those same problems that worried the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>. It was at  these
<ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ret  meetings,  according to the minutes,  that the idea of  a
communications  watch center for national emergencies -- the  <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>
-- was born. Along with it came a whole set of plans that would
allow the  military  to  take  over  commercial  communications
"assets" -- everything from ground stations and satellite  dishes
to fiberoptic cables -- across the country.
   At  a  1983  Federal Communications  Commission  meeting,  a
ranking <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>  Department  official  offered  the following
explanation for the founding of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>National Coordinating Center</ent></ent>:
"We are looking at trying to make communications endurable for  a
protracted  conflict." The  phrase  protracted  conflict  is  a
military euphemism for nuclear war.
   But  could  the <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent> survive even the first volley in such  a
conflict?
   Not  likely. It's located within a mile of  the  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>,
itself  an obvious early target of a <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> nuclear barrage (or a
conventional  strike, for  that  matter).  And  the <ent type='ORG'>Kremlin</ent>
undoubtedly knows its location and importance, and presumably has
included  it on its priority target list. In sum,  according to
one  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>  official,  "The  <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent> itself is  not  viewed  as  a
survivable facility."
   Furthermore,  the  <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>'s "Implementation Plan," obtained  by
<ent type='ORG'>Omni</ent>,  lists four phases of emergencies and how the center should
respond to each. The first,  Phase 0,  is Peacetime,  for which
there would be little to do outside of a handful of routine tasks
and  exercises. Phase 1 is Pre Attack,  in which alternate  <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>
sites  are alerted. Phase 2 is Post Attack,  in which other <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>
locations  are  instructed to take over the  center's  functions.
Phase  3  is  known as Last Ditch,  and in  this  phase  whatever
facility survives becomes the de facto <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>.
   So far there is no alternate <ent type='ORG'>National Coordinating Center</ent> to
which <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>  officials  could  retreat  to  survive  an attack.
According  to <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent> deputy director William  Belford,  no  physical
sites have yet been chosen for a substitute <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>, and even whether
the  <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>  itself  will survive a nuclear attack  is  still  under
study.
   Of  what use is a communications center that is not expected
to outlast even the first shots of a war and has no backup?
   The  answer  appears to be that because  of  the  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>'s
concerns about the AT&amp;T divestiture and the disruptive effects it
might  have  on national <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity,  the <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent> was to serve  as  the
military's peacetime communications center.
   The  center  is a powerful and unprecedented tool to  assume
control  over  the nation's vast communications  and  information
network. For  years the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> has been studying how to  take
over the common carriers' facilities.  That research was prepared
by  NSTAC  at the <ent type='ORG'>DoD</ent>'s request and is contained in a  series  of
internal <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> documents obtained by <ent type='ORG'>Omni</ent>. Collectively this
series is known as the Satellite Survivability Report.  <ent type='ORG'>Complete</ent>d
in  1984,  it  is  the  only detailed analysis  to  date  of  the
vulnerabilities  of  the commercial satellite  network. It  was
begun  as  a  way  of examining how to  protect  the  network  of
communications  facilities from attack and how to keep it  intact
for the <ent type='ORG'>DoD</ent>.
   A major part of the report also contains an analysis of  how
to make  commercial  satellites  "interoperable"  with  <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>
Department  systems.  While  the  report  notes  that current
technical differences  such  as  varying  frequencies  make  it
difficult  for  the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> to  use  commercial  satellites,  it
recommends ways to resolve those problems.  Much of the report is
a  veritable  blueprint  for the government on how to  take  over
satellites in orbit above <ent type='GPE'>the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent>. This  information,
plus  <ent type='ORG'>NSDD</ent> 145's demand that satellite operators tell the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent> how
their  satellites are controlled,  guarantees the military  ample
knowledge about operating commercial satellites.
   The <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> now has an unprecedented access to the civilian
communications network:  commercial databases, computer networks,
electronic  links,  telephone lines. All it needs is the  legal
authority to use them. Then it could totally dominate the  flow
of  all  information in <ent type='GPE'>the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent>. As one  high-ranking
White  <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> communications official put it: "Whoever  controls
communications, controls the country."  His remark was made after
our  <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>  Department could not communicate  directly  with  our
embassy  in  <ent type='GPE'>Manila</ent> during the anti-Marcos revolution last  year.
To  get  through,  the  <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> Department had  to  relay  all  its
messages through the <ent type='NORP'>Philippine</ent> government.
   Government  officials have offered all kinds of scenarios to
justify the  National  Coordinating Center, the Satellite
Survivability  Report,  new domains of authority for the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>
and  the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>,  and the creation of top-level government  steering
groups to think of even more policies for the military.  Most can
be  reduced to the rationale that inspired <ent type='ORG'>NSDD</ent>  145: that  our
enemies  (presumably  the  <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>s)  have to  be  prevented  from
getting too much information from unclassified sources. And the
only  way  to  do that is to step in and take  control  of  those
sources.
   Remarkably,  the communications industry as a whole has  not
been  concerned about the overall scope of the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>'s  threat
to  its  freedom  of  operation. Most  protests  have  been  to
individual  government actions. For example,  a media coalition
that includes the Radio-Television Society of Newspaper  Editors,
and  <ent type='ORG'>the Turner Broadcasting System</ent> has been lobbying that before
the  government  can  restrict the use  of  satellites,  it  must
demonstrate  why such restrictions protect against a  "threat  to
distinct  and  compelling  national <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity and  foreign  policy
interests."  But the whole policy of restrictiveness has not been
examined.  That may change sometime this year, when the Office of
Technology  Assessment  issues  a report on  how  the  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>'s
policy  will affect communications in <ent type='GPE'>the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent>.  In  the
meantime  the  military  keeps trying  to  encroach  on  national
communications.
   While  it may seem unlikely that the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> will ever  get
total control of our information and communications systems,  the
truth  is  that  it  can happen all  too  easily. The  official
mechanisms  are  already in place;  and few  barriers  remain  to
guarantee  that  what  we hear,  see,  and read will come  to  us
courtesy of our being members of a free and open society and  not
courtesy of the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>.</p>
