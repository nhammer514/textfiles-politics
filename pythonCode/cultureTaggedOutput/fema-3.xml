[Oliver] <ent type='ORG'>North</ent> managed to network himself into the highest levels of
the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and power centers around the world.  There he lied and
boastfully ignored the constitutional process, Bradlee writes.

Yet more terrifying is the plan hatched by <ent type='ORG'>North</ent> and other Reagan
people in <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Emergency Manpower Agency</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>): A blueprint
for the military takeover of <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent>.  The plan called for
<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> to become ``emergency czar'' in the event of a national emergency
such as nuclear war or an <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> invasion of a foreign nation.  <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>
would also be a buffer between the president and his cabinet and other
civilian agencies, and would have broad powers to appoint military
commanders and run state and local governments.  Finally, it would
have the authority to order suspect aliens into concentration camps
and seize their property.

When then-Attorney General William <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> Smith got wind of the plan,
he killed it.  After Smith left the administration, <ent type='ORG'>North</ent> and his <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>
cronies came up with the <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Resource Act, designed to suspendend
the First Amendment by imposing censorship and banning strikes.

Where was it all heading?  The book's answer: ``<ent type='ORG'>REX</ent>-84 Bravo, a
<ent type='ORG'>National Security Decision Directive</ent> 52 that would become operative
with the president's declaration of a state of national emergency
concurrent with a mythical U.S. military invasion of an unspecified
Central <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> country, presumably <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>.''

Bradlee writes that the <ent type='ORG'>Rex</ent> exercise was designed to test <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>'s
readiness to assume authority over <ent type='ORG'>the Department of <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent></ent>, the
<ent type='ORG'>National Guard</ent> in all 50 states, and ``a number of state defense
forces to be established by state legislatures.''  The military would
then be ``deputized,'' thus making an end run around federal law
forbidding military involvement in domestic law enforcement.

<ent type='ORG'>Rex</ent>, which ran concurrently with the first annual U.S. show of force
in <ent type='GPE'>Honduras</ent> in April 1984, was also designed to test <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>'s ability to
round up 400000 undocumented Central <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> aliens in the United
States and its ability to distribute hundreds of tons of small arms to
``state defense forces.''

Incredibly, <ent type='ORG'>REX</ent> 84 was similar to a plan secretly adopted by Reagan
while governor of <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>.  His two top henchmen then were Edwin
Meese, who recently resigned as U.S. attorney general, and Louis
Guiffrida, the <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> director in 1984.

This is the front-page article of the Jan. 16 issue of "The
<ent type='ORG'>Guardian</ent>," which describes some of the U.S. government's planning
for martial law in the event of the Gulf war. This is truly a
scary scenario that should concern all civil libertarians and
patriots.
------------------------------------------------------------------

 WILL GULF WAR LEAD TO REPRESSION AT HOME?
 by Paul DeRienzo and Bill Weinberg

On August 2, 1990, as Saddam Hussein's army was consolidating control
over <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>, President George Bush responded by signing two executive
orders that were the first step toward martial law in the United
States and suspending the Constitution.

On the surface, <ent type='ORG'>Executive Order</ent>s 12722 and 12723, declaring a
"national emergency," merely invoked laws that allowed Bush to freeze
<ent type='NORP'>Iraqi</ent> assets in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent>.

<ent type='ORG'>The International Emergency Executive Powers Act</ent> permits the president
to freeze foreign assets after declaring a "national emergency," a
move that has been made three times before -- against <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent> in 1987,
<ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent> in 1985 and <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> in 1979.

According to Professor Diana <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent>, of the Fletcher School of
Diplomacy at <ent type='GPE'>Boston</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>Tufts University</ent>, when Bush declared a national
emergency he "activated one part of a contingency national security
emergency plan." That plan is made up of a series of laws passed since
the presidency of Richard Nixon, which <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent> says give the
president "boundless" powers.

According to <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent>, such laws as the <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Industrial
Revitalization and Disaster Relief Acts of 1983 "would permit the
president to do anything from seizing the means of production, to
conscripting a labor force, to relocating groups of citizens."

<ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent> says the net effect of invoking these laws would be the
suspension of the Constitution.

She adds that national emergency powers "permit the stationing of the
military in cities and towns, closing off the U.S. borders, freezing
all imports and exports, allocating all resources on a national
security priority, monitoring and censoring the press, and warrantless
searches and seizures."

The measures would allow military authorities to proclaim martial law
in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent>, asserts <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent>. She defines martial law as the
"federal authority taking over for local authority when they are
unable to maintain law and order or to assure a <ent type='NORP'>republican</ent> form of
government."

A report called "<ent type='ORG'>Post Attack Recovery Strategies</ent>," about rebuilding
the country after a nuclear war, prepared by the right-wing Hudson
Institute in 1980, defines martial law as dealing "with the control of
civilians by their own military forces in time of emergency."

The federal agency with the authority to organize and command the
government's response to a national emergency is the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>). This super-secret and elite agency was
formed in 1979 under congressional measures that merged all federal
powers dealing with civilian and military emergencies under one
agency.

<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> has its roots in the World War I partnership between government
and corporate leaders who helped mobilize the nation's industries to
support the war effort. The idea of a central national response to
large-scale emergencies was reintroduced in the early 1970s by Louis
Giuffrida, a close associate of then-<ent type='GPE'>California</ent> Gov. Ronald Reagan and
his chief aide Edwin Meese.

Reagan appointed Giuffrida head of the <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> <ent type='ORG'>National Guard</ent> in
1969. With Meese, Giuffrida organized "war-games" to prepare for
"statewide martial law" in the event that Black nationalists and
anti-war protesters "challenged the authority of the state."  In 1981,
Reagan as president moved Giuffrida up to the big leagues, appointing
him director of <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>.

According to <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent>, however, it was the actions of George Bush in
1976, while he was the director of <ent type='ORG'>the Central Intelligence Agency</ent>
(<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>), that provided the stimulus for centralization of vast powers in
<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>.

Bush assembled a group of hawkish outsiders, called Team B, that
released a report claiming the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> ("Team A") had underestimated the
dangers of <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> nuclear attack. The report advised the development
of elaborate plans for "civil defense" and post-nuclear government.
Three years later, in 1979, <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> was given ultimate responsibility for
developing these plans.

Aware of the bad publicity <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> was getting because of its role in
organizing for a post-nuclear world, Reagan's <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> chief Giuffrida
publicly argued that the 1865 Posse Comitatus Act prohibited the
military from arresting civilians.

However, <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent> says that <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> eroded the act by giving the
military reserves an exemption from Posse Comitatus and allowing them
to arrest civilians. <ent type='ORG'>The <ent type='ORG'>National Guard</ent></ent>, under the control of state
governors in peace time, is also exempt from the act and can arrest
civilians.

<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> Inspector General John Brinkerhoff has written a memo contending
that the government doesn't need to suspend the Constitution to use
the full range of powers <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> has given the agency. <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> has
prepared legislation to be introduced in <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> in the event of a
national emergency that would give the agency sweeping powers. The
right to "deputize" <ent type='ORG'>National Guard</ent> and police forces is included in
the package. But <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent> believes that actual martial law need not be
declared publicly.

Giuffrida has written that "Martial Rule comes into existence upon a
determination (not a declaration) by the senior military commander
that the civil government must be replaced because it is no longer
functioning anyway." He adds that "Martial Rule is limited only by the
principle of necessary force."

According to <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent>, it is possible for the president to make
declarations concerning a national emergency secretly in the form of a
Natioanl Security Decision Directive. Most such directives are
classified as so secret that <ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent> says "researchers don't even
know how many are enacted."

DOMESTIC SPYING

Throughout the 1980s, <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> was prohibited from engaging in
intelligence gathering. But on July 6, 1989, Bush signed Executive
Order 12681, pronouncing that <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>National Preparedness Directorate</ent>
would "have as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence,
investigative, or national security work." Recent events indicate that
domestic spying in response to the looming <ent type='LOC'>Middle East</ent> war is now
under way.

<ent type='ORG'>Reynolds</ent> reports that "the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> is going to various campuses asking for
information on <ent type='LOC'>Middle East</ent>ern students. I'm sure that there are
intelligence organizations monitoring peace demonstrations."
According to <ent type='ORG'>the University of Connecticut</ent> student paper, the Daily
Campus, <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> officials have recently met there to discuss talking with
<ent type='LOC'>Middle East</ent>ern students.

<ent type='ORG'>The New York Times</ent> reports that the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> has ordered its agents around
the country to question Arab-<ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> leaders and business people in
search of information on potential <ent type='NORP'>Iraqi</ent> "terrorist" attacks in
response to a Gulf war.

A 1986 <ent type='ORG'>Immigration and Naturalization Service</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>INS</ent>) document entitled
"Alien Terrorists and Other Undesirables: A Contingency Plan" outlines
the potential round-up and incarceration in mass detainment camps of
U.S. residents who are citizens of "terrorist" countries, chiefly in
the <ent type='LOC'>Middle East</ent>. This plan echoed a 1984 <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> nationwide "readiness
exercise code-named <ent type='ORG'>REX</ent>-84 ALPHA, which included the rehearsal of
joint operations with the <ent type='ORG'>INS</ent> to round up 40000 Central <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent>
refugees in the event of a U.S. invasion of the region. One of the 10
military bases established as detainment camps by <ent type='ORG'>REX</ent>-84 ALPHA, Camp
Krome, <ent type='GPE'>Fla</ent>., was designated a joint <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>-Immigration service
interrogation center.

Recently, <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> has been criticized in the media for inadequate
response to the October, 1989 <ent type='GPE'>San Francisco</ent> earthquake. What the
mainstream press has failed to cover is the agency's planned role in
repressing domestic dissent in the event of an invasion abroad.

THE NATIONAL GUARDS
(C) 1987 <ent type='ORG'>OMNI</ent> MAGAZINE MAY 1987
(Reprinted  with  permission and license to  ParaNet  Information
Service and its affiliates.)

By Donald Goldberg

   The  mountains bend as the fjord and the sea beyond  stretch
out before the viewer's eyes.  First over the water, then a sharp
left  turn,  then a bank to the right between the peaks,  and the
secret naval base unfolds upon the screen.
   The  scene is of a <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> military installation on the  Kola
Peninsula in the icy <ent type='LOC'>Barents Sea</ent>,  a place usually off-limits  to
the gaze of the <ent type='NORP'>Western</ent> world.  It was captured by a small <ent type='NORP'>French</ent>
satellite called SPOT Image, orbiting at an altitude of 517 miles
above  the hidden <ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent> outpost. On each of several passes --
made  over a two-week period last fall -- the  satellite's  high-
resolution  lens  took  its pictures at a  different  angle;  the
images  were  then blended into  a  three-dimensional,  computer-
generated video. Buildings,  docks, vessels, and details of the
Artic landscape are all clearly visible.
   Half  a  world  away and thousands of feet  under  the  sea,
sparkling-clear images are being made of the ocean floor. Using
the  latest bathymetric technology and  state-of-the-art  systems
known as <ent type='ORG'>Seam Beam</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Hydrochart</ent>,  researchers are for the first
time  assembling  detailed  underwater maps  of  the  continental
shelves  and the depths of the world's oceans. These scenes  of
the  sea  are as sophisticated as the photographs taken from  the
satellite.
   From  the three-dimensional images taken far above the earth
to  the charts of the bottom of the  oceans,  these  photographic
systems  have  three  things in common: They both rely  on  the
latest  technology to create accurate pictures never  dreamed  of
even  25  years  ago;  they are being made  widely  available  by
commerical,  nongovernmental  enterprises;  and  the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>  is
trying desperately to keep them from the general public.
   In  1985 the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> classified the underwater  charts,  making
them  available  only  to approved researchers  whose  needs  are
evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Under a 1984 law the military
has  been given a say in what cameras can be licensed to be  used
on <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> satellites; and officials have already announced they
plan  to  limit  the  quality  and  resolution  of  photos made
available. <ent type='ORG'>The National Security Agency</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>) -- the secret arm
of the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> in charge of gathering electronic intelligence as
well as protecting sensitive U.S.  communications -- has defeated
a move to keep it away from civilian and commercial computers and
databases.
   That attitude  has  outraged  those  concerned  with the
military's  increasing efforts to keep information not only  from
the public but from industry experts,  scientists, and even other
government  officials as well. "That's like classifying a  road
map for fear  of  invasion,"  says  Paul Wolff, assistant
administrator for the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, of the attempted restrictions.
   These attempts to keep unclassified data out of the hands of
scientists,  researchers, the news media, and the public at large
are  a part of an alarming trend that has seen the military  take
an  ever-increasing  role in controlling the flow of  information
and communications through <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> society, a role traditionally
-- and  almost  exclusively  -- left  to  civilians. Under  the
approving  gaze  of  the  Reagan  administration,  Department  of
<ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>  (<ent type='ORG'>DoD</ent>)  officials have quietly implemented  a  number  of
policies, decisions, and orders  that  give  the military
unprecedented  control  over both the content and public  use  of
data and communications.  For example:

**The  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>  has  created a new category of  "sensitive"  but
unclassified  information  that  allows it to  keep  from  public
access huge quantities of data that were once widely accessible.
**<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Department</ent> officials have attempted to rewrite key laws
that  spell  out when the president can  and  cannot  appropriate
private communications facilities.
**The  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>  has installed a system that enables it to  seize
control  of  the nation's entire  communications  network  -- the
phone system,  data transmissions, and satellite transmissions of
all kinds  -- in  the  event  of  what  it  deems  a  "national
emergency."  As yet there is no single,  universally  agreed-upon
definition  of  what constitutes such a state. Usually such  an
emergency  is restricted to times of natural  disaster,  war,  or
when  national  security is  specifically  threatened. Now  the
military has attempted to redefine emergency.
   The  point man in the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>'s onslaught on communications
is  Assistant <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Secretary Donald C.  Latham,  a former  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>
deputy  chief. Latham now heads up an interagency committee  in
charge of writing and implementing many of the policies that have
put  the military in charge of the flow of  civilian  information
and communication.  He is also the architect of National Security
Decision  Directive 145 (<ent type='ORG'>NSDD</ent> 145),  signed by <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>  Secretary
Caspar Weinberger in 1984,  which sets out the national policy on
telecommunications and computer-systems security.
   First  <ent type='ORG'>NSDD</ent>  145  set  up  a  steering  group  of  top-level
administration  officials. Their job is to  recommend  ways  to
protect information that is unclassified but has been  designated
sensitive. Such  information  is held not  only  by  government
agencies but by private companies as well.  And last October  the
steering  group  issued  a  memorandum  that  defined sensitive
information and gave federal agencies broad new powers to keep it
from the public.
   According to Latham, this new category includes such data as
all medical records on government databases -- from the files  of
<ent type='ORG'>the National Cancer Institute</ent> to information on every veteran who
has ever applied for medical aid from <ent type='ORG'>the Veterans Administration</ent>
-- and all the information on corporate and personal taxpayers in
the  Internal  Revenue Service's  computers. Even  agricultural
statistics, he argues, can be used by a foreign power against the
<ent type='GPE'>United States</ent>.
   In  his  oversize yet Spartan <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> office,  Latham  cuts
anything but an intimidating figure.  <ent type='ORG'>Articulate</ent> and friendly, he
could  pass  for a network anchorman or a  television  game  show
host.  When  asked  how  the  government's  new  definition  of
sensitive information will be used,  he defends the necessity for
it and tries to put to rest concerns about a new restrictiveness.
   "The  debate  that  somehow  the <ent type='ORG'>DoD</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>  are  going  to
monitor  or  get into private databases isn't the case  at  all,"
Latham  insists. "The definition is just a guideline,  just  an
advisory. It does not give the <ent type='ORG'>DoD</ent> the right to go into private
records."
   Yet  the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Department</ent> invoked the <ent type='ORG'>NSDD</ent> 145  guidelines
when it told the information industry it intends to restrict  the
sale  of  data that are now unclassified and  publicly  available
from privately owned computer systems.  The excuse if offered was
that these data often include technical information that might be
valuable to a foreign adversary like the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union.
   <ent type='ORG'>Mead Data Central</ent> -- which runs some of the nation's largest
computer  databases,  such  as Lexis and <ent type='ORG'>Nexis</ent>,  and  has  nearly
200000 users -- says it has already been approached by a team of
agents  from <ent type='ORG'>the Air Force</ent> and officials from the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>
who  asked  for the names of subscribers and inquired  what  Mead
officials might do if information restrictions were imposed. In
response  to  government pressure,  <ent type='ORG'>Mead Data Central</ent>  in  effect
censured itself.  It purged all unclassified  government-supplied
technical  data  from  its  system  and  completely  dropped  the
National  Technical Information System from its  database  rather
than risk a confrontation.
   Representative Jack <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent>,  a <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent> who chairs the
<ent type='ORG'>House</ent> Government Operations Committee,  is an outspoken critic of
the  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>'s  role in restricting civilian information. He  notes
that  in 1985 the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent> -- under the authority granted by <ent type='ORG'>NSDD</ent>  145
-- investigated  a computer program that was widely used in  both
local  and federal elections in 1984. The computer  system  was
used to count more than one third of all votes cast in the United
States. While  probing  the system's vulnerability  to  outside
manipulation,  the  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>  obtained  a detailed knowledge  of  that
computer  program. "In  my  view," <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent>  says,  "this  is  an
unprecedented and  ill-advised  expansion  of  the military's
influence in our society."
   There are other <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent> critics. "The computer systems used by
counties  to  collect and process votes have nothing to  do  with
national  security,  and  I'm really concerned  about  the  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>'s
involvement," says <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>ic congressman Dan Glickman of <ent type='GPE'>Kansas</ent>,
chairman  of  the  <ent type='ORG'>House</ent>  science  and  technology subcommittee
concerned with computer security.
   Also,  under  <ent type='ORG'>NSDD</ent>  145 the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> has  issued  an  order,
virtually  unknown  to all  but a few industry  executives,  that
affects  commercial communications satellites. The  policy  was
made official by <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Secretary Weinberger in June of 1985 and
requires  that all commercial satellite operators that carry such
unclassified  government data traffic as routine <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>  supply
information  and  payroll data (and that  compete  for  lucrative
government  contracts)  install costly protective systems on  all
satellites  launched after 1990. The policy does  not  directly
affect the data over satellite channels, but it does make the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>
privy  to vital information about the essential signals needed to
operate a satellite.  With this information it could take control
of any satellite it chooses.
   Latham  insists this,  too,  is a voluntary policy and  that
only  companies that wish to install protection will  have  their
systems  evaluated by the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>. He also says industry  officials
are  wholly  behind  the move,  and argues  that  the  protective
systems  are necessary.  With just a few thousand dollars'  worth
of  equipment,  a  disgruntled employee could  interfere  with  a
satellite's  control  signals  and disable or  even  wipe  out  a
hundred-million-dollar satellite carrying government information.
   At best,  his comments are misleading.  First, the policy is
not  voluntary.  The  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>  can  cut  off  lucrative  government
contracts  to companies that do not comply with  the  plan. The
<ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> alone  spent  more  than  a  billion  dollars  leasing
commercial  satellite  channels  last  year;  that's  a  powerful
incentive for business to cooperate.
   Second,  the  industry's  support  is  anything  but  total.
According  to the minutes of one closed-door meeting between  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>
officials -- along with representatives of other federal agencies
--  and  executives from AT&amp;T, <ent type='ORG'>Comsat</ent>, <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>GTE</ent> Sprint</ent>, and  <ent type='ORG'>MCI</ent>,  the
executives  neither  supported  the  move  nor  believed  it  was
necessary. The  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>  defended  the policy  by  arguing  that  a
satellite  could  be held for ransom if the command  and  control
links  weren't  protected. But  experts  at  the  meeting  were
skeptical.
   "Why is the threat limited to accessing the satellite rather
than  destroying  it  with lasers or high-powered  signals?"  one
industry executive wanted to know.
   Most  of the officials present objected to the high cost  of
protecting the satellites.  According to a 1983 study made at the
request of the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>, the protection demanded by the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent> could
add  as  much as $3 million to the price of a  satellite  and  $1
million  more to annual operating costs.  Costs like these,  they
argue,  could cripple a company competing against less  expensive
communications networks.
   <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent>s  get  much of their information through  forms  of
electronic  communications,  from the telephone,  television  and
radio,  and information printed in many newspapers. Banks  send
important  financial  data,  businesses their  spreadsheets,  and
stockbrokers  their  investment portfolios,  all  over  the  same
channels,  from  satellite signals to computer hookups carried on
long  distance telephone lines. To make sure that  the  federal
government  helped  to promote and protect the efficient  use  of
this advancing technology, <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>  passed the massive
Communications Act of of 1934. It outlined the role and laws of
the communications structure in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent>.
   The  powers  of the president are set out in Section 606  of
that law;  basically it states that he has the authority to  take
control of  any  communications  facilities  that  he  believes
"essential  to  the national defense."  In the  language  of  the
trade this is known as a 606 emergency.
   There  have  been  a number of attempts in recent  years  by
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Department</ent> officials to redefine what qualifies as a  606
emergency  and  make  it  easier for the military  to  take  over
national communications.
   In  1981  the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> considered amendments to the  1934  act
that would allow  the  president, on <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Department</ent>
recommendation,  to require any communications company to provide
services,  facilities,  or  equipment  "to promote  the  national
defense  and  security  or  the  emergency  preparedness  of  the
nation,"  even  in  peacetime and without  a  declared  state  of
emergency. The  general  language had been drafted  by  <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>
Department  officials. (The  bill failed to pass the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent>  for
unrelated reasons.)
   "I  think  it is quite clear that they have snuck  in  there
some  powers that are dangerous for us as a company and  for  the
public  at large," said <ent type='ORG'>MCI</ent> vice president Kenneth Cox before the
<ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> vote.
   Since President Reagan took office, the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> has stepped
up  its  efforts to rewrite the definition of national  emergency
and give the military expanded powers in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent>.  "The
declaration  of  'emergency'  has always been  vague,"  says  one
former  administration official who left the government  in  1982
after ten years in top policy posts. "Different presidents have
invoked  it  differently. This administration would  declare  a
convenient 'emergency.'" In other words,  what is a nuisance to
one  administration  might  qualify  as a  burgeoning  crisis  to
another. For  example,  the Reagan administration might  decide
that a series of protests on or near military bases constituted a
national emergency.
   Should the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> ever be given the green light,  its base
for  taking  over the nation's communications system would  be  a
nondescript yellow brick building within the maze of high  rises,
government  buildings,  and apartment complexes that make up  the
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>  suburb of <ent type='GPE'>Arlington</ent>,  Virginia. Headquartered in  a
dusty and aging structure surrounded by a barbed-wire fence is an
obscure branch of the  military  known as the <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>
Communications  Agency  (<ent type='ORG'>DCA</ent>). It  does not have the  spit  and
polish  of  <ent type='ORG'>the National Security Agency</ent> or the dozens  of  other
government facilities that make up the nation's capital.  But its
lack of shine belies its critical mission: to make sure all  of
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s  far-flung  military  units can  communicate  with  one
another. It is in certain ways the nerve center of our nation's
defense system.
   On  the second floor of the <ent type='ORG'>DCA</ent>'s four-story headquarters is
a  new  addition called the National Coordinating  Center  (<ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>).
Operated  by the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>,  it is virtually unknown outside of  a
handful of industry and government officials.  The <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent> is staffed
around  the clock by representatives of a dozen of  the  nation's
largest  commercial  communications  companies  -- the  so-called
"common  carriers" -- including AT&amp;T, <ent type='ORG'>MCI</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>GTE</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Comsat</ent>, and  <ent type='ORG'>ITT</ent>.
Also  on hand are officials from <ent type='ORG'>the State Department</ent>,  the  <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>,
the  Federal  Aviation  Administration, and  a  number  of  other
federal agencies.  During a 606 emergency the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> can  order
the  companies that make up the National Coordinating  Center  to
turn  over their satellite, fiberoptic, and land-line  facilities
to the government.
   On a long corridor in the front of the building is a  series
of offices, each outfitted with a private phone, a telex machine,
and  a combination safe. It's known as "logo row" because  each
office  is occupied by an employee from one of the companies that
staff the <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent> and because their corporate logos hand on the  wall
outside. Each  employee  is  on  permanent  standby,  ready  to
activate his company's system should the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> require it.
   The  <ent type='ORG'>National Coordinating Center</ent>'s mission is as  grand  as
its  title  is  obscure:  to  make  available  to  the  <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>
Department  all  the  facilities of the  civilian  communications
network  in this country -- the phone  lines,  the  long-distance
satellite  hookups,  the  data transmission lines -- in times  of
national  emergency. If war breaks out and communications to  a
key military base are cut,  the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> wants to make sure  that
an  alternate  link can be set up as fast as  possible. <ent type='ORG'>Company</ent>
employees assigned to the center are on call 24 hours a day; they
wear beepers outside the office,  and when on vacation they  must
be replaced by qualified colleagues.
   The center formally opened on New Year's Day, 1984, the same
day  Ma Bell's monopoly over the telephone network of the  entire
<ent type='GPE'>United States</ent> was finally broken.  The timing was no coincidence.
<ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>  officials had argued for years along with AT&amp;T  against
the  divestiture  of Ma Bell,  on grounds of  national  security.
<ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Secretary  Weinberger  personally  urged  the  attorney
general to block the lawsuit that resulted in the breakup, as had
his predecessor,  Harold Brown. The reason was that rather than
construct its own communications network,  the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> had  come
to rely extensively on the phone company. After the breakup the
dependence continued.  The  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>  still  used  commercial
companies  to  carry more than 90 percent of  its  communications
within the continental <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent>.
   The 1984 divestiture put an end to AT&amp;T's monopoly over  the
nation's telephone service and increased the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>'s obsession
with  having its own nerve center. Now the brass had to contend
with  several  competing companies to acquire  phone  lines,  and
communications was more than a matter of running a line from  one
telephone to another.  Satellites, microwave towers, fiberoptics,
and  other  technological  breakthroughs  never  dreamed  of by
Alexander  Graham  Bell were in extensive use, and not  just  for
phone  conversations.  <ent type='ORG'>Digital</ent> data streams for computers  flowed
on the same networks.
   These  facts were not lost on the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Department</ent> or  the
White <ent type='ORG'>House</ent>. According to documents obtained by <ent type='ORG'>Omni</ent>, beginning
on  December  14,  1982,  a number of secret meetings  were  held
between high-level administration officials and executives of the
commercial  communications companies whose employees would  later
staff  the  <ent type='ORG'>National Coordinating Center</ent>. The  meetings,  which
continued  over  the next three years,  were held  at  the  White
<ent type='ORG'>House</ent>,  the  State  Department,  <ent type='ORG'>the Strategic Air Command</ent>  (<ent type='ORG'>SAC</ent>)
headquarters  at Offutt Air Force Base in <ent type='GPE'>Nebraska</ent>,  and  at  the
<ent type='ORG'>North</ent>  <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent>  Aerospace  <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Command (<ent type='ORG'>NORAD</ent>)  in  Colorado
Springs.
   The  industry officials attending constituted  the  National
Security  Telecommunications  Advisory Committee -- called  NSTAC
(pronounced  N-stack)  -- set up by President Reagan  to  address
those same problems that worried the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>. It was at  these
secret  meetings,  according to the minutes,  that the idea of  a
communications  watch center for national emergencies -- the  <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>
-- was born. Along with it came a whole set of plans that would
allow the  military  to  take  over  commercial  communications
"assets" -- everything from ground stations and satellite  dishes
to fiberoptic cables -- across the country.
   At  a  1983  Federal Communications  Commission  meeting,  a
ranking <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>  Department  official  offered  the following
explanation for the founding of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>National Coordinating Center</ent></ent>:
"We are looking at trying to make communications endurable for  a
protracted  conflict." The  phrase  protracted  conflict  is  a
military euphemism for nuclear war.
   But  could  the <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent> survive even the first volley in such  a
conflict?
   Not  likely. It's located within a mile of  the  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>,
itself  an obvious early target of a <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> nuclear barrage (or a
conventional  strike, for  that  matter).  And  the <ent type='ORG'>Kremlin</ent>
undoubtedly knows its location and importance, and presumably has
included  it on its priority target list. In sum,  according to
one  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>  official,  "The  <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent> itself is  not  viewed  as  a
survivable facility."
   Furthermore,  the  <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>'s "Implementation Plan," obtained  by
<ent type='ORG'>Omni</ent>,  lists four phases of emergencies and how the center should
respond to each. The first,  Phase 0,  is Peacetime,  for which
there would be little to do outside of a handful of routine tasks
and  exercises. Phase 1 is Pre Attack,  in which alternate  <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>
sites  are alerted. Phase 2 is Post Attack,  in which other <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>
locations  are  instructed to take over the  center's  functions.
Phase  3  is  known as Last Ditch,  and in  this  phase  whatever
facility survives becomes the de facto <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>.
   So far there is no alternate <ent type='ORG'>National Coordinating Center</ent> to
which <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>  officials  could  retreat  to  survive  an attack.
According  to <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent> deputy director William  Belford,  no  physical
sites have yet been chosen for a substitute <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>, and even whether
the  <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent>  itself  will survive a nuclear attack  is  still  under
study.
   Of  what use is a communications center that is not expected
to outlast even the first shots of a war and has no backup?
   The  answer  appears to be that because  of  the  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>'s
concerns about the AT&amp;T divestiture and the disruptive effects it
might  have  on national security,  the <ent type='ORG'>NCC</ent> was to serve  as  the
military's peacetime communications center.
   The  center  is a powerful and unprecedented tool to  assume
control  over  the nation's vast communications  and  information
network. For  years the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> has been studying how to  take
over the common carriers' facilities.  That research was prepared
by  NSTAC  at the <ent type='ORG'>DoD</ent>'s request and is contained in a  series  of
internal <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> documents obtained by <ent type='ORG'>Omni</ent>. Collectively this
series is known as the Satellite Survivability Report.  Completed
in  1984,  it  is  the  only detailed analysis  to  date  of  the
vulnerabilities  of  the commercial satellite  network. It  was
begun  as  a  way  of examining how to  protect  the  network  of
communications  facilities from attack and how to keep it  intact
for the <ent type='ORG'>DoD</ent>.
   A major part of the report also contains an analysis of  how
to make  commercial  satellites  "interoperable"  with  <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>
Department  systems.  While  the  report  notes  that current
technical differences  such  as  varying  frequencies  make  it
difficult  for  the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> to  use  commercial  satellites,  it
recommends ways to resolve those problems.  Much of the report is
a  veritable  blueprint  for the government on how to  take  over
satellites in orbit above <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent>. This  information,
plus  <ent type='ORG'>NSDD</ent> 145's demand that satellite operators tell the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent> how
their  satellites are controlled,  guarantees the military  ample
knowledge about operating commercial satellites.
   The <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> now has an unprecedented access to the civilian
communications network:  commercial databases, computer networks,
electronic  links,  telephone lines. All it needs is the  legal
authority to use them. Then it could totally dominate the  flow
of  all  information in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent>. As one  high-ranking
White  <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> communications official put it: "Whoever  controls
communications, controls the country."  His remark was made after
our  State  Department could not communicate  directly  with  our
embassy  in  <ent type='GPE'>Manila</ent> during the anti-Marcos revolution last  year.
To  get  through,  the  State Department had  to  relay  all  its
messages through the <ent type='NORP'>Philippine</ent> government.
   Government  officials have offered all kinds of scenarios to
justify the  National  Coordinating Center, the Satellite
Survivability  Report,  new domains of authority for the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>
and  the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>,  and the creation of top-level government  steering
groups to think of even more policies for the military.  Most can
be  reduced to the rationale that inspired <ent type='ORG'>NSDD</ent>  145: that  our
enemies  (presumably  the  <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>s)  have to  be  prevented  from
getting too much information from unclassified sources. And the
only  way  to  do that is to step in and take  control  of  those
sources.
   Remarkably,  the communications industry as a whole has  not
been  concerned about the overall scope of the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>'s  threat
to  its  freedom  of  operation. Most  protests  have  been  to
individual  government actions. For example,  a media coalition
that includes the Radio-Television Society of Newspaper  Editors,
and  <ent type='ORG'>the Turner Broadcasting System</ent> has been lobbying that before
the  government  can  restrict the use  of  satellites,  it  must
demonstrate  why such restrictions protect against a  "threat  to
distinct  and  compelling  national security and  foreign  policy
interests."  But the whole policy of restrictiveness has not been
examined.  That may change sometime this year, when the Office of
Technology  Assessment  issues  a report on  how  the  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>'s
policy  will affect communications in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent>.  In  the
meantime  the  military  keeps trying  to  encroach  on  national
communications.
   While  it may seem unlikely that the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> will ever  get
total control of our information and communications systems,  the
truth  is  that  it  can happen all  too  easily. The  official
mechanisms  are  already in place;  and few  barriers  remain  to
guarantee  that  what  we hear,  see,  and read will come  to  us
courtesy of our being members of a free and open society and  not
courtesy of the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>.
