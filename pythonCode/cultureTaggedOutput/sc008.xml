<p>Skolnick COMMENTARY #008
========================</p>

<p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve 
either all or portions of the following.]</p>

<p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put 
out by a group in <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up 
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>

<p>Hi! Sherman Skolnik, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts, 
9800 Oglesby.</p>

<p>A major news agency has keys to the future of the Clinton White 
House.</p>

<p>THE DETAILS</p>

<p>Hillary Rodham Clinton has been a law partner of Vincent Foster, 
jr., who became a <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> aide. Earlier, Foster and Hillary, 
as lawyers, arranged for <ent type='ORG'>Bank Lavoro</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Atlanta</ent>, and their twin, 
Bank of Criminals and Conspirators International [<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>], to get 
$4 billion to Saddam Hussein for weapons, including nuclear -- 
all disguised as U.S. agriculture loans, laundered through the 
[unclear] banking group and the Stevens(sp?) family, financially 
interlocked with the Clintons.</p>

<p>Hillary, and Foster, were attorneys fronting for these Little 
Rock bankers -- largest bond brokers outside of Wall Street. The 
role of Foster was more than just personal lawyer for Bill and 
his wife. Foster was also Hillary's lover -- sort of balancing 
off Bill's episodes with the mistress. After all, all is fair in 
love and war.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>The Resolution Trust Corporation</ent> [<ent type='ORG'>RTC</ent>] needed a new chief. 
Strange, but President Clinton, a purported <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>, in July '93 
appointed a George Bush <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>, Stanley Tate, to be <ent type='ORG'>RTC</ent> boss.</p>

<p>Clinton was blackmailed into it.</p>

<p>Yet Tate threatened a top-to-bottom corruption cleanup of this 
S&amp;L salvage agency [i.e. <ent type='ORG'>RTC</ent>]. A week later, Foster was murdered 
by three hit men from a <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> base.</p>

<p>A <ent type='ORG'>senate</ent> committee stonewalled Tate's ratification, and he 
withdrew his name late in November '93.</p>

<p>And thereafter escalated the Madison Guaranty S&amp;L mess and the 
<ent type='ORG'>Whitewater Development</ent> scandal. In Foster's office were 
incriminating records which were grabbed up to whitewash Hillary. 
It is an unanswered question whether Bill himself knew how Foster 
and Hillary siphoned off some $47 million from the S&amp;L.</p>

<p>To save Hillary from possible prison, Bill had key records 
suppressed and announced that Foster was a suicide. *Oh, yeah*?!</p>

<p>A fake, crumpled-up, so-called "suicide note" was later, 
supposedly, found in Foster's suitcase.</p>

<p>Bill and Hillary, by covering up the murder, have become 
accomplices to it -- a serious crime. (And some may think that 
what was cruel of her was to cover up the murder of her lover 
just to save herself.)</p>

<p>The major news group is deciding whether to go with these 
details, all documented to their satisfaction.</p>

<p>(AND: A close relative of Vice-President Albert Gore has said 
that he [Gore] will become President soon.)</p>

<p>But they had problems:
1) The news group's stock has already been slipping. At the same 
time, release of this timely story would cause a crack in the 
stock market and a fall in the news group's shares. So, they 
hesitate -- at least at this time, anyway;
2) But -- if they don't go with this story [that] they already 
have, they would lose credibility with other, competing news 
groups [who] may run with it; and
3) The ultra-rich got what they want in pushing Clinton, a 
relative unknown and a perceived misfit, into high office. So why 
wreck him now? Well, because it opens a window of emergency and 
opportunity, and the ultra-rich can complete their rotten agenda 
of repression and hardship inflicted on the ordinary people.</p>
