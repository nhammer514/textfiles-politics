    <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>  THE BIG PICTURE
    A system out of control, not just one bank
    By George Winslow

   This is the first story in a two-part "In These <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>" investigation
   into the broader economic implication of the <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> affair.


  IN THE EARLY `80S, PAKISTANI IMMIGRANT AZIZ Rehman was overjoyed
  to find a job in one of the world's fastest growing banks, the
  <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of Credit and <ent type='ORG'>Commerce International</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>).  The pay was
  good and the perks were even better.  His employer gave him a
  lavish expense account to entertain foreign diplomats--and he got
  to meet people like Jeb Bush, the U.S. vice president's son.
  But Rehman soon discovered that international finance had a less
  glamorous side.  Often, he had to lug heavy suitcases filled with
  cash through the sweltering <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> heat.  During the day, he
  worried about being robbed;  at night, he wondered about the
  bank's strange way of doing business.  <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> executives told Rehman
  the bags of cash were from a <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> branch in the <ent type='GPE'>Bahamas</ent>.  But
  Rehman knew they were lying.  The branch office didn't exist.
  Years later, it s clear that <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> has misplaced a lot more than
  a bank office.  On July 5 1991, bank regulators from several
  nations shut down <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>, charging that top executives had lost or
  stolen as much as $15 billion worth of deposits.
  Since then, the <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> affair has exploded into the biggest
  financial scandal of the `90s.  A barrage of press reports have
  detailed <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s involvement with drug dealers, <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> operators,
  corrupt dictators and sleazy arms dealers.  Even <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> officials
  have been quoted as calling <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> "the <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of Crooks and Criminals
  International."
  Unfortunately, the mainstream media has largely ignored a much
  bigger scandal--a revolution in the global economy that has
  produced many banks just like <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>.  This revolution has caused a
  terrifying cycle of poverty, drug addiction and financial fraud
  around the world.  Like the toxic waste given off by a chemical
  factory, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> is simply a noxious byproduct of a global economy
  based on profits and high finance, not human needs.

  HUMBLE BEGINNINGS:  The economic context of the <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> scandal
  begins with socialism and ends with the creation of a kind of
  capitalist utopia.
  In 1972, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s founder, Agha Hasan Abedi, was under house
  arrest in <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent>.  A socialist government had nationalized
  Abedi's United <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> and was investigating allegations of fraud at
  the institution.  But as police guarded his house, Abedi was
  already meeting with some of his powerful friends, plotting the
  creation of a new bank, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>.
  This bank, Abedi liked to say, would be the world's first
  "genuinely global bank."  <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>--then the world's
  largest bank--was trying to expand its international division.
  The huge U.S. bank was the first investor to jump on board.  <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent>
  of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> put up only $2.5 million to acquire a 25 percent stake
  in <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>, but its involvement helped Abedi get investment capital
  from powerful Third-World leaders and financiers.  One early
  investor was Sheik Zayed Bin Sultan al-Nahyan, ruler of oil-rich
  Abu Dhabi.  Other major investors would eventually include Kamal
  Adham, former chief of <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent> Arabia</ent>'s intelligence service;  the
  bin Mahfouz family, which also controls <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent> Arabia</ent>'s largest
  bank;  and other rulers from <ent type='GPE'>the United Arab Emirates</ent>.
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> went into operation with only $10 million in capital, but
  Abedi's timing was perfect.  Over the next 18 years, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> would
  grow by leaps and bounds.  By no coincidence, so would the
  international financial system.  In 1970, only about $60 billion
  moved through the international financial system each day.  Today
  more than $2 trillion worth of stocks bonds and currencies cross
  national borders--a 3200 percent increase.  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> took full
  advantage of this growth.  By early 1990, it had grown into a $21
  billion bank with 425 branches in over 75 countries that served
  1.2 million customers.

  <ent type='ORG'>UNCLE SAM</ent>'S FALL:  A dramatic period of political and economic
  disorder produced the global economic revolution that allowed <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>
  to thrive.  One year before <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> was founded, President Richard
  Nixon announced that <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> would devalue the dollar,
  effectively ending the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> government's control over the
  international financial system.
  During World War II <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> had emerged as the globe's
  dominant economic and military power.  In 1944, the <ent type='ORG'>Bretton Woods</ent>
  agreement established a system of fixed exchange rates based on
  the dollar.  By making the dollar the equivalent of gold in world
  trade, U.S. economic policies became the world's economic
  policies.  <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> could print dollars to finance the Marshall
  Plan in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> and other programs designed to open up markets to
  <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> corporations.  And it could mint money to build up
  <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s military establishment--which, in turn, protected U.S.
  investments in other countries.  It was a "free world based on the
  dollar and backed by the atomic bomb," according to Richard Barnet
  and Ronald Muller, authors of "The <ent type='ORG'>Global Reach</ent>:  The Power of
  Multinational Corporations."
  By 1971, however, U.S. corporations had lost their competitive
  edge to <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> and the U.S. military had wasted hundreds of
  billions of dollars in <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>.  Nixon's decision to devalue the
  dollar and effectively end the <ent type='ORG'>Bretton Woods</ent> agreement on fixed
  exchange rates simply recognized the inevitable--<ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>
  no longer ruled the world.

  A NEW KING:  Assuming the U.S. government's throne, huge
  multinational corporations had become the world's new imperial
  power.  <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> foreign investments jumped from $29.1 billion in
  1955 to $120 billion in 1970 and $373 billion in 1989.  Foreign
  investments by every country in the world grew nearly tenfold from
  $112.3 billion in 1967 to $1023 billion in 1987.
  U.S. banks also expanded their international operations to
  provide financial services to their blue-chip clients.  In 1965,
  only 20 U.S. banks with 112 branches had set up shop overseas.  By
  1988, 132 <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> banks had 849 foreign branches, holding a total
  of more than $275 billion in assets.
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> was quick to establish a relationship with many of the U.S.
  banks that had expanded overseas in the '70s.  A confidential
  internal <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> study, obtained by "In These <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>," illustrates
  just how many U.S. banks had close financial relationships with
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>.  The 1985 study notes that for all of 1984, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> transferred
  foreign currencies worth $37.5 billion through <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> banks.
  Most of these foreign currency transfers, $19 billion, involved
  five major <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> banks:  <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, Security Pacific,
  <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> Express <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> Ltd., the <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> and First
  Chicago.
  The <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> study also shows that on an average working day in
  1984, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> conducted 1434 transactions involving $2.7 billion
  with the five banks.  Most of those transactions (700 in all,
  worth $1.7 billion) involved <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>--even though <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of
  <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> had sold its stake in <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> in 1980.

  CAPITALIST <ent type='ORG'>UTOPIAS</ent>:  The rapid growth of the global economy also
  produced dramatic changes in the very structure of the
  international economic system.  Massive military expenditures from
  <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>--along with increased imports--caused billions of dollars
  to flow out of <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>.  In the '60s, banks began
  loaning these dollars--called "Eurodollars" because they were
  often held in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an banks--to corporations, thus creating the
  world's first unregulated, international financial market.  In
  1963, only about $148 million worth of bonds or loans were issued
  in the Eurodollar market.  By 1988 over $721 billion worth of
  securities and loans were made in the market.
  Most Eurodollar trading occurs in what are known as offshore
  havens.  Typically these havens--located in places like <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>,
  <ent type='GPE'>Hong Kong</ent> and the <ent type='GPE'>Bahamas</ent>--operate as a kind of capitalist utopia
  for transnational corporations.  Strict bank-secrecy laws protect
  depositors from the prying eyes of tax collectors or foreign
  investigators.  Lax local regulations allow foreign banks to carry
  on many activities--such as selling stocks and bonds--that may be
  illegal or tightly regulated in their home countries.  More
  importantly, taxes are virtually non-existent.
  Today, offshore havens manage over $5 trillion worth of assets-
  -nearly the size of the U.S. gross national product for 1990.  But
  before the rise of the Eurodollar market, many of these havens
  didn't exist or played only a minor role in international finance.
  The <ent type='GPE'>Cayman Islands</ent>, for example, didn't set up shop as an offshore
  center until the mid-'60s.  But by 1990, the <ent type='NORP'>Caribbean</ent> nation was
  home to over 500 banks from all over the world--including 46 of
  the 50 largest--holding over $250 billion in assets.
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> was one of the banks that most profited from the rise of
  offshore finance.  It capitalized by setting up its headquarters
  in <ent type='GPE'>Luxembourg</ent>, an offshore haven, and by establishing subsidiaries
  in dozens of other havens.  By 1990, for example, its Cayman
  Islands subsidiary held over $7.5 billion worth of assets.
  By the start of the '90s, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> and other banks that operated out
  of the offshore financial havens played key roles in the new
  economic order dominated by multinational corporations.  As the
  United States learned when it was forced to end fixed exchange
  rates, the new global economic system was too powerful for any one
  government to control.  For <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>, as well as for international
  criminal elements, this was a dream come true.

  PEEKABOO FINANCE:  From the start, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> understood the beauty of
  offshore finance.  Operating out of regulation-free havens, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>
  was able to embark on what international investigators have called
  "the most complex deception in banking history."  To hide the fact
  that <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> "may never have been profitable in its entire history,"
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s auditors say that top executives used the offshore system
  to set up "a massive and complex web of fictitious transactions."
  Over a 15-year period, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> shuffled nearly $15 billion through
  over 750 accounts.  For example, after losing an astonishing $849
  million speculating in U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent> bonds between 1979 and 1986,
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> executives simply parked the losses in its <ent type='GPE'>Cayman Islands</ent>
  subsidiary, where bank regulators wouldn't find them.  Then it
  illegally shuffled new deposits through various havens to make it
  look as if hundreds of millions of dollars worth of loans to <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>
  executives and large shareholders were being repaid.  In fact,
  they weren't.  As Rep. Charles Schumer (D-<ent type='GPE'>NY</ent>) recently stated,
  "<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> fell between the international cracks."
  These cracks are beginning to look more and more like canyons.
  Law-enforcement experts say that offshore banks provide essential
  financial services for many of the world's most profitable crimes,
  including the drug business (in which $300 billion is laundered
  worldwide each year, according to <ent type='ORG'>the State Department</ent>), tax fraud
  (which, according to <ent type='ORG'>the Internal Revenue Service</ent>, totals $100
  billion a year in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> alone) and securities fraud
  (which adds up to $10 billion annually in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>,
  according to a recent private study).  Offshore banking also aids
  the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> (which launders over $70 billion annually, according to
  the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>) and black-market arms traffickers.  (Offshore bank
  accounts were used in the <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>-contra affair, illegal arms sales
  to <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> and several recent illegal sales of technology used to
  make nuclear bombs.)  Furthermore, Sen.  John Kerry (D-MA)
  contends that "billions" looted from U.S. savings-and-loans ended
  up in secret offshore accounts.  Such accounts were also used by
  the perpetrators of Watergate, as well as the recent scandals at
  <ent type='ORG'>the Department of Housing and Urban Development</ent> and at the
  <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>.
  As a full-service bank, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> diversified into almost all of
  these criminal activities.  But before exploring its role as a
  "<ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of Crooks and Criminals International," it's worth
  remembering that some of <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s largest crimes were quite legal--
  at least in the context of the lawless offshore financial system.

  A <ent type='ORG'>FREE LUNCH</ent>:  Consider, for example, taxes.  While Aziz Rehman
  was carrying large bags of cash around <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> for <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>, he noticed
  that many of the bank's clients weren't interested in drugs or
  arms or weird <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> plots.  They simply wanted to avoid taxes.  In
  one case--uncovered by the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> Subcommittee on Terrorism,
  Narcotics and International Operations, which is headed by Sen.
  Kerry--Modern Health Care had <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> wire $20 million into an
  account in the <ent type='NORP'>Caribbean</ent>.
  "They got interest over there, and they never showed that
  interest into <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> [for tax purposes]," Rehman
  remembers.  "That's why people deposit outside <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>.
  But <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> is by no means the only bank that has been involved in
  tax fraud.  Using offshore havens to avoid the <ent type='ORG'>IRS</ent> has become
  standard operating procedure for many financial institutions.  In
  the mid-'70s, for example, while <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> City</ent> was going broke and
  drastically cutting social services, city officials charged that
  <ent type='ORG'>Citibank</ent> had used offshore havens to avoid over $30 million in
  taxes.  In this case, <ent type='ORG'>Citibank</ent> created a series of fictitious
  transactions that made it look as if its subsidiaries in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>
  and <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> were losing money.  Then, the profits were recorded in
  subsidiaries located in offshore havens.  (A Reagan appointee to
  <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Securities and Exchange Commission</ent></ent> eventually dropped charges
  against the bank, explaining that he did "not subscribe to the
  theory that a company that violates tax and exchange-control
  regulations is a bad corporation.")
  Foreign corporations have also used the offshore system to avoid
  paying U.S. taxes.  For example, the <ent type='ORG'>IRS</ent> claims that foreign
  multinational corporations operating in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> avoided
  between $13 billion and $30 billion worth of U.S. taxes in the
  '80s.
  The issue of tax fraud in the <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> scandal has been virtually
  ignored by the mainstream media, but it has had a horrifying
  effect on the quality of life in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>.  Over time, the ability
  of banks like <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> to help corporations avoid taxes, has left a
  big hole in local, state and federal budgets.
  In 1950, when offshore finance and multinational production
  didn't play a very important role in the world's economy, U.S.
  corporations paid 26 percent of all state, local and federal
  taxes.  But by 1990, their share had dropped to only 8 percent.
  Of course, offshore banking wasn't the only reason for this
  decline--but it certainly helped.  If U.S. corporations still paid
  26 percent of all taxes, they would have paid an extra $329
  billion in 1990 alone.  This number is worth remembering when
  people talk about <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> as simply a case of bank fraud, far removed
  from problems like poverty, bad schools or potholes.


  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  | `<ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of Crooks and Criminals International' had   |
  |  links to U.S. intelligence and <ent type='ORG'>Third World</ent> tyrants  |
  |      |
  | It's no wonder <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of Credit and</ent> Commerce   |
  |   International (<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>) is enmeshed in one of the   |
  |   biggest financial scandals of the 20th century.  A   |
  |   list of <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s shareholders reads like a who's who of  |
  |   corrupt Third-World elites.  Most of them have a long  |
  |   history of involvement in major arms deals or  |
  |   corporate bribery scams.  In addition, several key   |
  |   <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> insiders have extensive ties to <ent type='NORP'>Western</ent>   |
  |   intelligence agencies.     |
  | These same figures helped loot the bank, receiving |
  |   hundreds of millions of dollars worth of loans that  |
  |   were never repaid.     |
  | One major shareholder and a front man for <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s   |
  |   illegal purchases of various <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> banks--  |
  |   including First <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent>shares in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>,   |
  |   D.C.--was Sheikh Kamal Adham, the brother-in-law of  |
  |   the late <ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent> King Faisal.  During the `60s and   |
  |   `70s, Kamal ran the <ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent> equivalent of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> and  |
  |   <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.  And like many members of the <ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent> ruling    |
  |   family, he often demanded commissions (a polite way  |
  |   of saying bribe) from multinational corporations   |
  |   operating around the <ent type='LOC'>mideast</ent>.    |
  | In the `50s and `60s, Kamal accepted kickbacks from  |
  |   the <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese in return for cheap oil.  He also took  |
  |   commissions for arms deals set up for Northrup and   |
  |   two other U.S. arms dealers.  In the '70s, according |
  |   to the "<ent type='ORG'>Wall Street Journal</ent>," he was paid "many    |
  |   millions of dollars in commission" by <ent type='ORG'>Boeing</ent> to    |
  |   persuade the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent>ians</ent> to buy its planes.    |
  | Besides his extensive ties to the U.S. arms  |
  |   industry, Kamal maintained close ties to <ent type='NORP'>Western</ent>   |
  |   intelligence agencies.  In 1977, the "<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>   |
  |   Post" described Kamal as the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>'s "liason man" in   |
  |   the region and noted that Kamal had hired former <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> |
  |   station chief Raymond Close as an adviser.  In the   |
  |   late `60s, Kamal acted as the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>'s intermediary to  |
  |   funnel payments to Anwar Sadat while Sadat was vice  |
  |   president of <ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent>.  According to Larry Gurwin's 1990  |
  |   article in the business magazine "<ent type='ORG'>Regardie</ent>'s," Kamal |
  |   channeled hundreds of millions of dollars to <ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent>   |
  |   after Sadat took power.  These funds convinced Sadat |
  |   to expel <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> military advisers in 1973 and to   |
  |   establish a closer relationship with the United    |
  |   States.      |
  | In Kamal's years as the head of <ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent> intelligence,  |
  |   he was responsible for a number of human rights    |
  |   abuses, including torture and executions of political  |
  |   opponents.  Internal <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> documents show that Kamal  |
  |   received over $313 million in loans from <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>, most  |
  |   of which have not been repaid.   |
  | Other one-time <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> shareholders with close  |
  |   connections to the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and the <ent type='NORP'>Western</ent> arms industry |
  |   include <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>'s now-ousted ruling family.  Shah   |
  |   Mohammed Reza Pahlevi, whose family held stock in  |
  |   <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> as late as 1978, was installed in power in 1953 |
  |   by a <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>-backed coup against Mohammed Mossadeq, who  |
  |   had nationalized <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> oil companies.  In the   |
  |   `70s, before he was overthrown, the Shah purchased   |
  |   billions of dollars worth of arms from <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent>    |
  |   companies.     |
  | <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>i</ent> businessman Faisal Saud al Fulajj was a  |
  |   small <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> shareholder.  According to the "Wall    |
  |   Street Journal," he accepted over $300000 in bribes |
  |   from <ent type='ORG'>Boeing</ent> while he was head of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent> Airlines</ent>.  |
  |   Fulajj was also one of seven men who received $47  |
  |   million in bribes to illegally act as a frontman for |
  |   <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s illegal and secret purchases of various   |
  |   <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> banks, including First <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent>.    |
  | Mohammed Irvani was another frontman with ties to  |
  |   <ent type='NORP'>Western</ent> intelligence.  He set up a consulting firm   |
  |   with former <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> director Richard Helms in 1977.    |
  | Ali Mohammed Shorafa was a small <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> shareholder  |
  |   and yet another frontman in the First <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent>   |
  |   affair.  According to columnist Jack Anderson and  |

  |   that received an exclusive contract to ship U.S. arms  |
  |   to <ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent> right after the Camp David accords.   |

  |   least $113 million in loans and Shorafa $123 million |

  | Agha Hasan Abedi, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s founder, kept close ties  |
  |   to <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent>i military and intelligence officials.  |
  |   Abedi hired a number of bank officials with links to |
  |   the <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent>i military or intelligence services.  <ent type='ORG'>The  </ent>|
  |   "Financial <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>" of <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> has reported that the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>  |
  |   used <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> to funnel payments to the <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent>i  |
  |   military.  Recently, the "<ent type='ORG'>Wall Street Journal</ent>  |
  |   reported that one top <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent>i official who refused |
  |   to extradite Abedi to <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> to face    |
  |   charges of fraud and larceny, "had received (from  |
  |   <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>) a monthly stipend, free travel, a home loan and  |
  |   an expensive automobile."    |
  | Abedi was so close to <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent>i Dictator Zia al-   |
  |   Haq, that Zia rushed to Abedi's bedside when the   |
  |   banker had a heart attack.  Zia's term in office   |
  |   produced massive human rights violations and   |
  |   continual allegations that top Kaistani officials  |
  |   were involved in the lucrative heroin trade.  Zia  |
  |   overthrew the democratically elected government of   |
  |   Zulfikav Ali Bhutto and executed Bhutto.   |
  | The U.S. government rewarded Zia's support for the |
  |   <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent> rebels with $2.1 billion worth of U.S.  Agency  |
  |   for <ent type='ORG'>International Development</ent> grants and hundreds of |
  |   millions of dollars in military aid.   |
  | The bin Mahfouz family--which owns <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent> Arabia</ent>'s  |
  |   largest bank--sold its 20 percent stake in <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> in   |
  |   1990.  The family also has a long history of   |
  |   corruption and financial fraud.  In the late `70s,   |
  |   for example, the family teamed up with the Hunt    |
  |   brothers, infamous <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> oil barons, in an illegal   |
  |   attempt to manipulate the price of silver by   |
  |   cornering the world silver market.  The operation  |
  |   nearly touched off a worldwide financial panic before  |
  |   it was halted by U.S. regulators.  More recently, the  |
  |   bin Mahfouz family used <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> as a private piggy bank,  |
  |   receiving over $176 million in unsecured loans from  |
  |   the bank.      |
  | Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the ruler of Abu  |
  |   Dhabi and head of <ent type='GPE'>the United Arab Emirates</ent> us <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s |
  |   largest shareholder.  He rose to power in 1966 when  |
  |   the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> encouraged him to overthrow his brother, |
  |   Sheikh <ent type='ORG'>Shakbut</ent>, who provoked widespread unrest by  |
  |   refusing to spend his oil revenues on various  |
  |   development schemes.  (<ent type='ORG'>Shakbut</ent> once justified his  |
  |   policies by saying the oil companies needed the money  |
  |   more than the citizens of his country did.)    |
  | Sheik Zayed proved to be the more enlightened    |
  |   ruler, spending billions to establish a social   |
  |   welfare state for the citizens of Abu Dhabi.  But he |
  |   still treats Abu Dhabi's oil revenues (about $1    |
  |   billion a month) as personal income, using it to   |
  |   build lavish mansions around the world.  As a staunch  |
  |   U.S. ally, he has spent billions on U.S. and <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an  |
  |   arms.  President Bush recently asked <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> to   |
  |   approve another $648 million U.S. arms deal as a   |
  |   reward for Sheik Zayed's staunch support for the U.S.  |
  |   during the <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> war.     |

  <ent type='ORG'>LOOTING</ent> THE THIRD WORLD:  During the '80s, <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent>s weren't the
  only ones faced with cuts in social services and declining
  standards of living.  Between 1980 and 1985, average incomes in
  Latin <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> fell by 9 percent.  Some heavily indebted countries
  like <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent> (where incomes dropped 17.7 percent) and <ent type='GPE'>Bolivia</ent>
  (down 29.4 percent) fared even worse.
  But, as the average Latin <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> suffered, wealthy elites used
  banks like <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> to take hundreds of billions of dollars out of
  their homelands.  <ent type='ORG'>Court</ent> documents and <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> hearings show that
  <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>'s Manuel Noriega, <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>'s Saddam Hussein, the <ent type='GPE'>Philippines</ent>'
  Ferdinand Marcos, <ent type='GPE'>Haiti</ent>'s Jean-Claude Duvalier and other dictators
  used <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> to steal billions of dollars from native countries.  The
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> affair illustrates how large multinational corporations have
  established close financial and political ties with corrupt
  Third-World elites, who used <ent type='NORP'>Western</ent> arms sales, political
  repression and the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> to maintain their power (see accompanying
  story in box).
  But in going after the capital-flight business, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> wasn't
  doing anything out of the ordinary.  Estimates of how much money
  has been moved out of Third-World countries vary, but all of them
  are alarming.  <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Morgan</ent> Guarantee</ent> Trust</ent>, a U.S. financial
  institution, estimates that local elites transferred over $200
  billion out of the Third-World into the <ent type='NORP'>Western</ent> financial system
  between 1975 and 1985.  Other researchers have produced estimates
  as high as $660 billion--equal to about half of all outstanding
  Third-World debts.  <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Morgan</ent> Guarantee</ent> notes that the ten most-
  heavily indebted Latin <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> countries borrowed $375 billion
  between 1975 and 1985.  During that time, an amount equal to about
  half of that borrowed money was siphoned out of these countries by
  capital flight.  <ent type='GPE'>Venezuela</ent>, for example borrowed $36 billion, but
  had $41 billion leave the country.

  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'S PALS IN HIGH PLACES:  Such huge debts have left many
  Third-World countries dependent on the International Monetary
  Fund, the World <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent>, the U.S. government and various other
  international development bodies.  But these bodies have promoted
  Third-World development strategies that stress foreign
  investment--thus increasing the power of multinational
  corporations.  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> was one of the primary beneficiaries of such
  policies.
  The <ent type='ORG'>IMF</ent>, the World <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> and the U.S. government have supported a
  number of projects to establish offshore havens.  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s most
  notorious money-laundering operation occurred in <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>, where one
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> official says he acted as Manuel Noriega's "personal banker."
  This, of course, wouldn't have been possible if a U.S. Agency for
  <ent type='ORG'>International Development</ent> official hadn't helped <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent> set up an
  offshore haven in 1970.
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> also had large operations in virtually every <ent type='NORP'>Caribbean</ent>
  offshore haven--and it established close ties to many <ent type='NORP'>Caribbean</ent>
  governments.  Internal <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> documents show that the bank received
  large deposits from virtually every central bank in the <ent type='NORP'>Caribbean</ent>
  and from the <ent type='NORP'>Caribbean</ent> Development <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>CDB</ent>), a regional lending
  institution that is heavily funded by <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>.  The <ent type='ORG'>CDB</ent>
  has provided many loans to <ent type='NORP'>Caribbean</ent> countries who wanted to set
  up tax-free industrial havens for multinational corporations.
  But ties between <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> and development agencies went far beyond
  general policy discussions and the creation of offshore havens.
  The "<ent type='ORG'>Wall Street Journal</ent>" noted recently that "[t]he U.S.
  government was one of <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s biggest customers in <ent type='GPE'>Cameroon</ent>, with
  $10 million in U.S. Agency for <ent type='ORG'>International Development</ent> accounts.
  That is equal to about 5 percent of <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Cameroon</ent>'s published
  assets."
  More importantly, "In These <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>" has learned that the <ent type='ORG'>IMF</ent>
  contacted officials at central banks in <ent type='GPE'>Brazil</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent> and
  <ent type='GPE'>Uruguay</ent> about <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s expansion into Latin <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>.  The <ent type='ORG'>IMF</ent> also
  gave <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> advice on how the bank could expand its operations in
  <ent type='GPE'>Bolivia</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Peru</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Colombia</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Ecuador</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Venezuela</ent>.
  The <ent type='ORG'>IMF</ent> further suggested that <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> might get deposits from
  central banks in Latin <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> if it established correspondent
  bank relationships with these banks.  (Correspondent banks provide
  various financial services for each other, such as taking deposits
  and wire transfers.)  After it followed that advice, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>
  eventually established banking relationships with central banks in
  at least 30 countries around the world.  Because of <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s
  financial troubles, many of these banks may lose a large share of
  the money they deposited with <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>.  One former World <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>IMF</ent>
  official has already been indicted by <ent type='GPE'>Peru</ent>vian officials for his
  role in having <ent type='GPE'>Peru</ent>'s central bank reserves deposited at <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>.
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> put together other deals that involved the World <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> and
  the <ent type='ORG'>IMF</ent>.  According to "<ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>" magazine, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> intervened in a
  dispute between the <ent type='ORG'>IMF</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Jamaica</ent> over the country's inability
  to pay its mounting debts.  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> brokered a deal with the-lMF in
  which <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> agreed to provide a new $48 million loan to <ent type='GPE'>Jamaica</ent>.
  Soon thereafter, <ent type='GPE'>Jamaica</ent>'s central bank agreed to make large
  deposits with <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>.
  One <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> employee, Amjad Awan, also told Kerry subcommittee
  investigators that the World <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> suggested <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> provide a loan to
  <ent type='GPE'>Bolivia</ent>.  After <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> provided the loan, which was guaranteed by
  the World <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Bolivia</ent>'s central bank began depositing money in
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>.

  IN THE RED:  Ironically, as the <ent type='ORG'>IMF</ent> and the World <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> were using
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> to help solve the debt crisis in several countries, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> was
  engaging in a number of illegal transactions that actually
  increased the debt various Third-World countries were paying.
  Jack Blum, a former counsel for the Kerry subcommittee, claims
  that <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> became very active in "the business of brokering Third-
  World debt."  Many of these debts, which were in arrears, were
  nearly worthless or were being sold by banks for about 20 cents on
  the dollar to outside investors.  Blum says that these investors
  would contact <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>, which would intervene with a Third-World
  government.  Under a scheme promoted by the <ent type='ORG'>IMF</ent>, the World <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent>
  and <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>, many governments would agree to pay back
  all of the debt (not just the 20 percent that the investor had
  paid for it), if the debt-purchaser would invest the money in the
  debtor country or use the money to buy a company the country's
  government was trying to sell.
  But according to Blum, many investors made huge profits while
  investing very little in Third-World nations.  An example of such
  a transaction can be found in <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent>.  In the late '80s, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>
  bought <ent type='NORP'>Argentinian</ent> debt for an unknown discount, then had the
  <ent type='NORP'>Argentinian</ent> government redeem it at full value.  It's unclear how
  much <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> paid for the <ent type='NORP'>Argentinian</ent> debt, which currently sells for
  79 cents on the dollar.  Assuming <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> bought the debt at the
  current rate (which is a very conservative guess), the bank would
  have paid only $30 million for $38 million of debt, producing a
  quick $8 million profit.
  To hold up the bank's end of the deal, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> frontman Ghaith
  Pharoan then agreed to invest $38 million in a hotel and farm in
  <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent>.  But according to the "<ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>," Pharoan only
  invested about $10 million.  Assuming, conservatively, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> made
  an $8 million windfall on the deal, the bank, in effect, purchased
  a $10 million hotel for $2 million.  <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent>, on the other hand,
  spent $38 million to redeem its debt and received only $2 million
  in new investment money.
  Jack Blum laid out <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s illegal Third-World debt operations in
  an August 1991 testimony before the Kerry committee.  The debt
  scam, Blum pointed out, "is a very major business.  I think it
  runs to billions of dollars."
  Yet, like many of the other multibillion-dollar economic scams
  covered by this article, Blum's testimony attracted virtually no
  press attention.  Once again, the mainstream media's lack of
  interest in larger economic issues led it to ignore a scandal that
  has impoverished many Third-World countries.
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> is not the first scandal of its kind.  In the early `80s,
  the Vatican bank scandal produced widespread calls for a tougher
  system of international bank regulations.  But nothing was done.
  As prosecutors sift through the wreakage of the <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> affair,
  banks like <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> continue to use offshore havens to help
  multinational corporations avoid taxes, and to aid corrupt Third-
  World leaders in looting their countries.  The international
  financial system still operates outside the control of any real
  government authority.  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> will happen again.

    <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> THE BIG PICTURE
   New capitalism:  bank fraud, drug trade, espionage
    By George Winslow

  In its October 23 issue, "In These <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>" began a two-part
  series on the broader economic and social issues of the <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>
  affair.  Author George Winslow argued that the real scandal
  was not a lone wayward bank, but a world financial system
  out of control.  Winslow examined how, during the past two
  decades, multinational corporations rose to global economic
  dominance.  He then documented the way in which operations
  like <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> use "offshore havens" to do these corporations
  banking.
  Such havens--located in places like <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Hong Kong</ent> and
  the <ent type='GPE'>Bahamas</ent>--free corporations from the taxes, oversight and
  laws of their home countries.  They also help Third-World
  leaders loot their own nations, thus increasing those
  countries debts and putting further strain on the shaky U.S.
  economy.  No matter what happens in the ongoing <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>
  investigation, Winslow concluded, the offshore financial
  system that spawned the bank still operates outside of the
  control of any real government authority.  "<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> will happen
  again," he wrote.
  In the following story, Winslow examines how larger economic
  issues shed new light on <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s more notorious operations--
  the bank's ties to the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, drug dealers, sleazy S&amp;Ls and
  influence peddlers.



  EVEN IN <ent type='GPE'>MIAMI</ent>, WHERE EXCESS HAS BECOME a fine art, David Paul, the
  chairman of <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Savings</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent>, stood out from the pack.  Paul,
  who raised lots of money for top <ent type='ORG'>Democratic Party</ent> politicians,
  used bank funds to buy a $13 million Rubens that he hung in his
  opulent estate and insisted that his $7 million yacht be built
  with 14 carat gold nails.
  But by the late '80s, Paul was in trouble.  <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent>, like many
  other S&amp;Ls, had suffered huge losses by speculating in securities
  and junk bonds.  For years he had hidden the losses with
  accounting tricks that were legalized by <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and the Reagan
  administration.  But, as the public began howling about fraud in
  the S&amp;L industry, bank regulators ordered Paul to make the losses
  public, a move that threatened to ruin his bank.
  To buy time, Paul used his political clout to arrange meetings
  with top regulators in the Reagan administration.  At the
  meetings, Paul introduced <ent type='ORG'>Ghaith <ent type='NORP'>Pharaon</ent></ent>, a wealthy <ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent>
  financier who had already bought 25 percent of <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent>.  Paul
  implied that <ent type='NORP'>Pharaon</ent> and his wealthy <ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent> friends planned to save
  the bank.
  Impressed with this display of wealth, regulators let <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent>
  stay in business.  <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent> lost more money and Paul kept throwing
  lavish parties--at one $122000 affair he flew six famous chefs
  first class from <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>.  When bank
  regulators finally shut down <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent> in 1990, taxpayers got stuck
  with a bill for $2 billion.
  The <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent> fiasco took place in <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>--half-
  way around the world from Abu Dhabi, where a number of <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of
  Credit and <ent type='ORG'>Commerce International</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>) executives are now under
  house arrest.  But the <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent> affair illustrates how the sun
  never sets on the new world of bank fraud.  <ent type='ORG'>Ghaith <ent type='NORP'>Pharaon</ent></ent>--the
  wealthy <ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent> financier who was supposed to save <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent>--was
  simply one of the front men that <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> used to secretly buy and
  loot at least four <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> banks.

  THE PRICE WE PAY:  The "<ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>" recently assured its
  readers that many of <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s crimes would have little effect on
  <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent>s.  "[The] money laundering and other corruption at <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>
  occurred largely overseas. ...  The criminals and most, if not
  all, of the victims of <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s scams were foreigners," the "<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>"
  wrote.
  But that is not at all the case--and in this article, "In These
  <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>" will examine how and why.  Many of <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s alleged crimes,
  such as its involvement in the S&amp;L scandal, were conceived in the
  United States--and most of the bank's foreign criminal activity
  would not have been possible without the complicity of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent>
  business and government.
  Today, it would be hard to find an <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> who hasn't been
  victimized by <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>.  Taxpayers have spent billions of dollars, and
  may have to spend billions more, to bail out banks looted by <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>
  and its clients.  Financial services provided by <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> and other
  banks helped international drug traffickers bring tens of billions
  of dollars worth of illegal narcotics into <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>.
  Arms transactions financed or administered by <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> accelerated a
  <ent type='LOC'>Mideast</ent>ern arms race that helped trigger the U.S.-<ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>i war.  And
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> was not the only major financial institution to profit from
  bank fraud, arms deals and drug smuggling.  These problems--and
  the financial system that nourishes them--will continue.

  <ent type='ORG'>SEC</ent>RET INVASION:  Only five years after being founded in the Third
  World, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> began its invasion of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>.  In 1977, several of
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s largest shareholders launched a hostile bid for the largest
  bank in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C., Financial General <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent>shares (now called
  First <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent>shares).  There were problems from the start.
  A number of the investors were simply <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> front men, many of them
  with long histories of involvement in corporate bribery scandals.
  A <ent type='ORG'>Securities and Exchange Commission</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>SEC</ent>) investigation into the
  deal uncovered a wide range of illegal securities transactions.
  Normally these violations would have disqualified potential
  investors from handling billions of dollars in federally insured
  deposits.  But <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s high-powered legal team, headed by Clark
  Clifford--a former secretary of defense and adviser to four
  presidents--convinced <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Reserve Board</ent> to approve the
  deal on the condition that <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> would not control the bank.  It
  was a condition <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> ignored from the start.  Over the next
  decade, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> also used <ent type='ORG'>Ghaith <ent type='NORP'>Pharaon</ent></ent> as a frontman to secretly
  acquire a minority stake in <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent>, as well as controlling
  interests in the National <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of Georgia and the Independence
  <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of Encino, <ent type='GPE'>Calif</ent>.  As with its secret purchase of First
  <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent>shares, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> shifted money through a bewildering
  array of offshore havens to convince regulators that the banks
  were being bought by wealthy <ent type='NORP'>Arabs</ent> with lots of cash.  In fact,
  the real owner was <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>.
  Then, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> used the same system of offshore finance to loot the
  banks.  For example, soon after <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> lost over $849 million
  speculating in U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent> bonds, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> executives had First
  <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent>shares (<ent type='ORG'>FAB</ent>) pay $220 million for <ent type='ORG'>Ghaith <ent type='NORP'>Pharaon</ent></ent>'s
  shares in National Georgia <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent>.  According to the "Wall Street
  Journal," <ent type='ORG'>FAB</ent> paid between $20 million to $60 million more than
  any other bank was willing to pay.  The deal had the effect of
  transferring $220 million from a very solvent bank, <ent type='ORG'>FAB</ent>, to
  <ent type='NORP'>Pharaon</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> at a time when the latter two were in deep
  financial trouble.
  Today, the effects of <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s involvement are plain.  <ent type='ORG'>FAB</ent>, once a
  solvent, well-capitalized commercial bank, is in dire financial
  straits.  Recently regulators gave <ent type='ORG'>FAB</ent>, which lost $182 million in
  1990, a rating of "four."  Five means the banks is broke and
  should be shut down:  one is an excellent rating.  The $11 billion
  bank, which now has $469 million worth of bad loans, could easily
  cost U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars if it collapses.

  NEW RULES:  More importantly, the <ent type='ORG'>FAB</ent> fiasco illustrates how the
  new world of international finance has affected the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent>
  banking industry.  The increasingly unregulated international
  financial system of the '70s and <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> financial system as
  well.
  This deregulation dramatically changed the structure of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent>
  finance (see "In These <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>," Oct. 2).  For the first time since
  the Depression, banks were allowed to expand their operations into
  the insurance and securities markets.  <ent type='ORG'>Savings</ent>-and-loan
  associations were permitted to make speculative investments in the
  commercial real-estate market--a practice that ruined many S&amp;Ls.
  Large corporations, which had once raised most of their short-term
  debt from commercial banks, now turned to foreign banks and Wall
  Street firms.  Securities firms such as <ent type='ORG'>Merrill Lynch</ent> offered
  certificates of deposit--encroaching on a traditional market of
  banks--and channeled tens of billions of dollars into shady S&amp;Ls.
  Finance companies--especially subsidiaries of large auto makers--
  stepped onto another traditional turf of the banking industry the
  auto-loan market.  <ent type='ORG'>Sears</ent> and other retailers. which were once
  content to sell power tools and lawn chairs, began peddling credit
  cards and stocks.
  These changes not only increased competition among financial
  institutions, but also reduced profits and led to increasingly
  speculative investments.  <ent type='ORG'>Deregulation</ent> led to a decade of
  financial fraud and mismanagement.  Like <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>, some S&amp;L owners
  used secret bank accounts in offshore havens to hide their
  ownership or to embezzle millions of dollars.
  Federal authorities made it easier for investors to buy banks,
  allowing many shady financiers to move into the industry.  Many of
  these financiers, such as Charles Keating and David Paul, set up
  elaborate business and political ties with <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s clients,
  advisers and shareholders.  These ties show that <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> was not
  simply a foreign problem--and that the S&amp;L scandal goes far beyond
  U.S. borders.  In the '80s, high-flying institutions like <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> and
  <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent> became magnets for con artists of all kinds.

  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> AND THE S&amp;L SCANDAL:  For example, Charles Keating and his
  thrift, <ent type='ORG'>Lincoln</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Savings</ent> and Loan, invested millions of dollars in
  <ent type='ORG'>Trendinvest</ent>, an offshore company that speculated in foreign
  currencies.  According to the "<ent type='ORG'>Wall Street Journal</ent>," <ent type='ORG'>Lincoln</ent>
  suffered "large losses" from trades made at <ent type='ORG'>Trendinvest</ent> and
  "lawyers representing investors ... defrauded by Mr. Keating . .
  . accuse him of shifting money overseas through such mechanisms as
  foreign exchange losses."
  A <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> executive, Alfred Hartmann, served on <ent type='ORG'>Trendinvest</ent>'s board
  of directors and advised Keating on the foreign-exchange
  transactions.  In 1989, <ent type='ORG'>Lincoln</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Savings</ent> and Loan filed for
  bankruptcy--a move that cost taxpayers over $2.5 billion.
  Another notorious S&amp;L con artist is Herman <ent type='ORG'>Beebe</ent>.  <ent type='ORG'>Beebe</ent> had a
  history of bank fraud as well as alleged business ties to the
  <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>--which would normally have prevented him from buying a bank.
  But in the '80s world of deregulated banking, <ent type='ORG'>Beebe</ent> was able to
  secretly buy and loot at least 100 S&amp;Ls.
  <ent type='ORG'>Beebe</ent>'s exploits are documented in the book, "Inside Job:  The
  Looting of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>Savings</ent> and Loans," by Stephen Pizzo, Mary
  Fricker and Paul Muolo.  According to the authors, one of <ent type='ORG'>Beebe</ent>'s
  closest business associates, Ben Barnes, set up partnership with
  John <ent type='ORG'>Connally</ent>, the former governor of <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>.  The partnership
  borrowed money from at least 17 S&amp;Ls.  But the partnership failed
  to pay back many of the loans, due to the real-estate crash.
  <ent type='ORG'>Connally</ent>, a one-time <ent type='GPE'>US</ent>. treasury secretary, was forced into
  bankruptcy.
  In the late '70s, <ent type='ORG'>Connally</ent> owned a <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> bank with <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> front
  man <ent type='NORP'>Pharaon</ent>, according to Stephen Fay's book, "Beyond Greed:  The
  Hunt Family's Bold Attempt to Corner the Silver Market."  <ent type='ORG'>Connally</ent>
  introduced the bin Mafouze family, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s second-largest
  shareholder, to the Hunt brothers, the infamous oil barons who
  lost their $10 billion fortune trying to illegally manipulate the
  world's silver market.  The bin Mafouze family and <ent type='NORP'>Pharaon</ent>
  invested in the Hunt scam and suffered huge losses.
  Through <ent type='NORP'>Pharaon</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> connection also leads
  back to the biggest con artists of the S&amp;L scandal--Michael Milken
  and his firm, <ent type='ORG'>Drexel Burnham Lambert</ent>.  The Federal Deposit
  Insurance Corporation (<ent type='ORG'>FDIC</ent>) has charged that Milken, Drexel,
  <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent>'s Paul and <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> rigged a sale of $150 million worth of
  junk bonds to make it appear as if <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent> had raised more
  capital than it actually had.
  More importantly, a $6.8 billion suit filed by the <ent type='ORG'>FDIC</ent> alleges
  that Milken, Drexel, Keating and Paul set up a network of junk-
  bond buyers at <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent> and other S&amp;Ls who "wilfully, deliberately
  and systematically plundered certain S&amp;Ls."  This network used
  "illegal and manipulative secretive trading activities" to trade
  bonds back and forth to each other, creating "an illusion of an
  efficient, growing and liquid market for junk bonds."
  In other words, the <ent type='ORG'>FDIC</ent> believes that the network created a
  bogus market for junk bonds that artificially inflated the prices
  for these bonds.  When the market finally collapsed, many S&amp;Ls
  such as <ent type='ORG'>CenTrust</ent>, went broke, costing taxpayers at least $6
  billion.

  HOOKED ON DRUG MONEY:  Financial crime, however, wasn't the only
  toxic byproduct of global financial deregulation. The authors of
  "Inside Job" have noted that organized crime groups produced tens
  of billions of dollars worth of revenue each year.  These criminal
  organizations needed financial institutions to launder their
  profits:  "Thrift deregulation fulfilled ... those needs nicely.
  ...  Not only had the rules been drastically eased, but the cops
  [thrift examiners] were no longer much of a threat, their ranks
  having been gutted after state and federal deregulation."
  Financial pressures also forced many banks to turn a blind eye
  toward money laundering.  Faced with declining profits, bad
  Third-World debts and increased competition, banks needed new
  deposits and customers.
  Handling drug money had been illegal in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> since
  the <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> Secrecy Act of 1970.  But, in practice, the rewards often
  exceeded the penalties.  Between 1970 and 1985, only two thrifts
  were fined for money laundering.  And a federal crackdown on money
  laundering in the mid-'80s produced only $21 million worth of
  fines against 44 banks--a small portion of the $50 billion to $100
  billion worth of drug money laundered through <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> banks each
  year.  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> was one of the banks that capitalized on this booming
  industry.  Like many other financially troubled institutions,
  drug-cartel deposits helped <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> hide its losses and keep growing.
  Naturally, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> executives worked very hard to keep their
  customers happy.
  <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>nian dictator Manuel Noriega, for example, received
  millions of dollars in kickbacks from the <ent type='GPE'>Medellin</ent> drug cartel.
  When Noriega set up a $25 million account with <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>, bank
  executives issued him credit cards for his wife and mistress.
  They booked him into posh <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> City</ent> hotels and they took him
  on shopping sprees at the city's largest department stores where
  Noriega ran up as much as $100000 worth of credit-card bills.
  Noriega is believed to have laundered at least $90 million through
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>.
  In other cases, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> actually helped drug dealers set up
  sophisticated laundering systems.  For example, when a U.S.
  undercover agent, Robert <ent type='ORG'>Musella</ent>, began depositing money from the
  <ent type='GPE'>Medellin</ent> cartel at <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>, the bank sent <ent type='ORG'>Musella</ent> to <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> for a
  kind of seminar in laundering.  Then, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> set up a <ent type='NORP'>Byzantine</ent>
  system of offshore corporations and banks that <ent type='ORG'>Musella</ent> used to
  launder $16 million in drug money.
  Here, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s skill at manipulating the deregulated U.S. banking
  industry played a key role.  At least some of the drug money that
  <ent type='ORG'>Musella</ent> was laundering for the <ent type='GPE'>Medellin</ent> cartel made its way
  through First <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> and other banks secretly controlled by
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>, according to House <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent>ing Committee investigators.
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> taught <ent type='ORG'>Musella</ent> so much about the secret world of money
  laundering that government investigators were able to indict 85
  people and launch investigations into the activities of 41 major
  banks, including <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>.  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> eventually paid a $15
  million fine, only a small part of the profits it made from
  laundering over $1 billion worth of drug money for the <ent type='GPE'>Medellin</ent>
  cartel in the '80s.
  But while the mainstream media has focused on <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> as a full-
  service bank for drug dealers, media reports have paid very little
  attention to money laundering by other major banks.  For example,
  <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> was hit with a $4.75 million fine for money
  laundering in 1986.  It was the largest money-laundering fine
  until the <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> case.  Yet two years later, the financially
  troubled <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> was still laundering money.
  In 1989, U.S. investigators cracked an operation that used
  jewelry stores, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> and many other banks to launder over $12
  billion in cocaine profits for the <ent type='GPE'>Medellin</ent> cartel.  Major banks
  that accepted cash deposits from the drug-money-laundering
  organization included <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> ($32 million), Republic
  National <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> ($185 million), <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> Express <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> ($11 million),
  <ent type='ORG'>Citibank</ent> ($63 million), and <ent type='ORG'>Extebank</ent> ($138 million).  (<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>, which
  received a $13 million wire transfer from the <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>,
  was a relatively minor player in this scheme.)

  DRUGS, GUNS AND <ent type='ORG'>IDEOLOGY</ent>:  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s money-laundering activities also
  have a political context that has been largely ignored by the
  mainstream media.  Over the last decade, the Reagan and Bush
  administrations have attempted to portray the war against drugs as
  a Cold War crusade.  By attacking "narco-terrorists," Reagan
  attempted to link Latin <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> revolutionaries and Latin
  <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> drug traffickers--thus justifying, for example, U.S.
  military intervention in <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>.  Likewise, Bush recently sent
  military advisers to <ent type='GPE'>Peru</ent> to fight left-wing guerrillas involved
  in the drug trade.
  But, in fact, billionaires who run the drug cartels are hardly
  left-wing rebels.  They are a lot like most wealthy Third-World
  elites who use terror and illegal arms deals to maintain their
  power.
  In 1989, for example, <ent type='GPE'>Colombia</ent>n officials raided the farm of
  Gonzalo Rodriquez Gacha, one of the founders and a top leader of
  the <ent type='GPE'>Medellin</ent> drug cartel.  Here they found hundreds of assault
  rifles that had been imported from <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent> Military Industries</ent>,
  the state-owned arms manufacturers.
  They also found a bizarre home video.  It showed members of the
  cartel at a paramilitary training camp attacking a mock village
  and firing their guns into homes.  The men were screaming
  "<ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> guerrillas, we want to drink your blood"--hardly a
  slogan that <ent type='NORP'>Marxist</ent> revolutionaries would use.
  The weapons, <ent type='GPE'>Colombia</ent>n officials soon discovered, had been used
  to assassinate a number of union leaders attempting to organize
  workers at large farms owned by the cartel.  The paramilitary
  camp--backed by the <ent type='GPE'>Colombia</ent>n military and financed by the
  cartel--trained <ent type='GPE'>Colombia</ent>n death squads.  The camp had been set up
  by <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>i</ent> arms dealers and former military officers.
  One officer, Lt. Col. Amatzia Shuali had trained military
  officers in <ent type='GPE'>Guatemala</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>n <ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent> rebels in <ent type='GPE'>Honduras</ent>.
  At the camp, members of the cartel learned how to make bombs that
  had been used to blow up a <ent type='GPE'>Colombia</ent>n airliner with 117 passengers.
  This horrifying affair has been virtually ignored by the
  <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> media and it has not been covered in any of the articles
  on <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>.  Yet "In These <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>" has learned that U.S. government
  investigators are probing allegations that <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> had ties to
  several of the people who set up the camps.  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> had a large
  number of branches in <ent type='GPE'>Colombia</ent> that were used by the cartels, and
  druglord Gacha was a <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> customer.
  More importantly, the case illustrates how Cold War politics
  have corrupted the war on drugs.  In <ent type='GPE'>Colombia</ent>, this policy had
  disastrous effects.  After the discovery of one cocaine lab, U.S.
  officials claimed the drug trade was being run by the guerrillas.
  The charge was later proven false.  In fact, the <ent type='GPE'>Colombia</ent>n
  military was aligned with the drug dealers.  One of the front
  companies used to set up the death-squad camps was actually owned
  by the <ent type='GPE'>Colombia</ent>n minister of defense.  As a result, millions of
  dollars in U.S. aid, earmarked for the war on drugs, was actually
  going to fight the guerrillas.

  OFFSHORE A-BOMB IND<ent type='GPE'>US</ent>TRY:  Guns for the drug cartels represented
  only a small part of <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s arms supermarket.  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> was involved
  in the sale of guns to the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent>s</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>-backed <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent>
  rebels.  Gun dealers hired by <ent type='ORG'>the National Security Council</ent>'s
  Oliver North used the bank to illegally sell tow missiles to <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>
  during the <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>-contra affair.  And the banks provided financial
  services for Silkworm missiles sold to <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent> Arabia</ent>, Scud-B
  missiles bought by <ent type='GPE'>Syria</ent>, weapons purchased by the Abu Nidal
  terrorist group, <ent type='ORG'>Mirage Jets</ent> acquired by <ent type='GPE'>India</ent> and helicopters
  sold to <ent type='GPE'>Guatemala</ent>.
  Some of the most terrifying deals apparently involved atomic
  bombs.  Sen. Alan Cranston (D-CA), has alleged that <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> was
  involved in programs by <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Libya</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> to
  build atomic bombs.  In addition, former <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> investigator Jack
  Blum says that Munther Bilbeisi, an arms dealer "whose brother was
  a [<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>] branch bank manager" and a "major" <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> customer, was
  involved "in an effort to sell enriched uranium from <ent type='GPE'>South Africa</ent>
  to <ent type='LOC'>the Middle East</ent>."
  In each case, arms dealers obtained export licenses under the
  pretext of shipping arms to a given country.  But the arms would
  never arrive at their official destination.  Instead using a
  system of dummy corporations and secret bank accounts at
  unregulated offshore havens, the dealers were able to illegally
  ship the materials to their real destination.
  So far, the "<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> Post" has been the only major paper to
  explain that the "global banking system ... makes it relatively
  easy to finance cross-borders smuggling of sensitive nuclear
  technology."  This is partly because "international banks ...
  are under no obligation to check whether the materials being
  transported are legal."

  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> AND THE <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>:  More importantly, very few media reports have
  put <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s arms sales in a larger context of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> foreign
  policy and covert operations.
  The congressional <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent> committee noted that then-<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
  director William Casey "wanted to establish an offshore entity
  capable of conducting operations in furtherance of U.S. foreign
  policy that was `stand-alone'--financially independent of
  appropriated funds, and, in turn, congressional oversight."
  Like the transnational corporations that created the offshore
  financial world to avoid government control, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> was able to
  use <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> and the offshore financial system to set up its own
  unregulated, private, foreign-policy apparatus.  In this way, it
  could ignore <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, which had outlawed aid to the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>-
  backed <ent type='ORG'>Nicarguan <ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent></ent> rebels, and public opinion, which was
  opposed to U.S. military intervention in the region.
  Countries that agreed to cooperate with this "secret
  government"--including <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>, <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent> Arabia</ent> and other <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent>
  states--received billions in U.S. aid and arms during the '80s.
  Arms dealers and banks like <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> profited from the deals by
  charging huge fees and by receiving official protection for some
  of their illegal operations, such as drug smuggling.
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s history, structure and expertise made it a perfect
  vehicle for the secret government's covert operations.  Set up as
  an offshore bank, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> operated out of unregulated financial
  havens where covert operations could be easily hidden.  Like many
  other corrupt Third-World elites, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s shareholders also had a
  long history of ties to <ent type='NORP'>Western</ent> arms dealers and intelligence
  agencies.
  <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>'s Manuel Noriega was an important figure in the secret
  scheme to illegally fund the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent>s</ent>.  Jose Blandon, a former
  Noriega aide, claims that the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> advised Noriega to use <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> as
  his bank.  Various published sources say that the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> was
  depositing as much as $200000 a year in Noriega's account at
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>.  Noriega, in turn, helped Oliver North set up dummy
  corporations and secret bank accounts that were used to finance
  the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent>s</ent>.
  <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent> also played a key role.  <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent> shipped Noriega more than
  $500 million worth of arms during the '80s, supplied the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent>s</ent>
  with guns and helped sell weapons to <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> in the <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent>
  affair.  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> is known to have worked with <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>i</ent> officials on
  several arms deals during this period.  The bank also provided
  financing for a number of arms shipments to <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> in the <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>-
  <ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent> affair.  Another country that acted as a <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> proxy in
  <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent> was <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent> Arabia</ent>, which gave the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent>s</ent> at least $22
  million.
  The <ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent>s also provided <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>-supported rebels fighting the
  <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>-backed <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent> government with about half of their funds.
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s longstanding ties to <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent>'s military and to the <ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent>
  royal family made the bank a logical choice to funnel <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> aid in
  <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent>istan.  Recently, <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent>'s finance minister, Sartaj Aziz,
  told the "Financial <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>" that <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> was used by the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> to direct
  arms and money to the <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent>istan rebels.  The official also said
  that U.S. intelligence agencies had set up a slush fund for
  <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent>i military leaders who helped the <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent> resistance.
  During the same interview, the finance minister claimed drug
  traffickers in the region had used <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> to launder profits from
  sales of heroin.  Furthermore, it's clear that the <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent> rebels
  sold drugs to buy arms.  ("We i must grow and sell opium to fight
  our holy war," a rebel commander once told the "<ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>.")
  And the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> may have been involved.  "In These <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>" has learned
  that government investigators are probing allegations that one <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
  official supervised the <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>-financed shipment of drugs and arms
  through <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent>.

  BANKING ON WAR:  But getting rid of <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> won't hinder those
  government officials who, like William Casey and Oliver North, are
  determined to undermine <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> democracy.  It's important to
  remember that the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> has used banks like <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> for decades.
  During the '60s, '70s and '80s, for example, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> laundered
  money for coups and covert operations through the Castle <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> in
  the <ent type='GPE'>Bahamas</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>the World Finance Corporation</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent> and the
  Nugan Hand <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of Australia.  Like <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>, these banks had ties to
  organized crime figures, drug dealers and spies.  Like <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>, they
  all had links to <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> banking and S&amp;L scandals.  And like
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>, fraud and speculative investments by top executives forced
  all three banks out of business.
  More recently, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> had ties with 22 failed thrifts that
  loaned money to people involved in "gun running, drug smuggling,
  money laundering and covert aid to the <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>n <ent type='NORP'><ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent>s</ent>,"
  according to the "<ent type='ORG'>Houston Post</ent>."
  Over time, the booming <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>-backed arms trade has produced big
  profits for arms dealers and banks like <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>.  But these black-
  market sales have also touched off a terrifying arms race in the
  <ent type='ORG'>Third World</ent>.
  Consider, for example, the role that <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> and many other banks
  played in a secret operation to build up Saddam Hussein's military
  might.  Last summer, a joint investigation by <ent type='ORG'>ABC</ent>'s "Nightline"
  and the "Financial <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>" concluded that "Robert <ent type='ORG'>Gates</ent> was deeply
  involved as deputy director of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> in a major covert operation
  that funneled weapons and technology to <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>. ...  The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>'s
  covert shipments put into Saddam Hussein's hand some of the most
  dangerous battlefield weapons in the world."
  To carry out these shipments, <ent type='ORG'>Gates</ent>--now the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> director-
  designate--allegedly met with Carlos Cardoen, the head of
  Industrias Cardoen.  This <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent>an company, which was the largest
  private supplier of weapons to <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>, shipped more than $500
  million worth of weapons to <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> in the '80s (see "In These
  <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>," April 17 and Oct. 9).
  Industrias Cardoen is licensed to build and ship high-tech
  artillery guns created by arms dealer Gerald <ent type='ORG'>Bull</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>ArmsCor</ent>, an
  arms manufacturer owned by the <ent type='GPE'>South Africa</ent>n government.
  In 1990, Gerald <ent type='ORG'>Bull</ent> was assassinated, allegedly by <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>i</ent>
  agents because he was working with Saddam Hussein to build a
  "supergun" capable of firing nuclear and chemical weapons.  <ent type='ORG'>Bull</ent>,
  an expert on advanced artillery, had a long history of illegal
  arms sales.  In the late '70s, a congressional staff report found
  that <ent type='ORG'>Bull</ent> had conspired with <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agents to break the U.S. arms
  embargo against <ent type='GPE'>South Africa</ent> by shipping technology that allowed
  <ent type='ORG'>ArmsCor</ent> to develop sophisticated artillery guns.
  In 1990, the <ent type='ORG'>Inter Press</ent> news service reported that over 200 of
  these guns had been sold by Cardoen and <ent type='ORG'>ArmsCor</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>.  At least
  50 to 70 had been sold to <ent type='GPE'>the United Arab Emirates</ent>, which is
  headed by <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s largest shareholder.
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> enters this affair in two ways.  In August, <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>'s
  "Independent" newspaper alleged that <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> had helped <ent type='ORG'>Bull</ent>'s
  company, <ent type='ORG'>Space Research</ent>, smuggle propellant for Hussein's supergun
  from <ent type='GPE'>Belgium</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>.  The story, largely ignored in the United
  States, also reported that "a former deputy prime minister [Andre
  Cools] of <ent type='GPE'>Belgium</ent> was killed days after being given <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> bank
  statements alleging bribes were paid to beat the arms embargo" to
  <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>.
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> also loaned at least $72 million to the <ent type='GPE'>Atlanta</ent> branch of
  <ent type='ORG'>the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent>)--Italy's largest bank.  This
  <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> branch loaned <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> over $4 billion between 1985 and 1989 and
  provided financial services that allowed Hussein to illegally buy
  hundreds of millions of dollars worth of arms and military
  supplies.  The <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> branch didn't have enough money to take on such
  large loans, so it illegally financed them by borrowing money from
  banks like <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>.  The House <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent>ing Committee says that <ent type='ORG'>Bull</ent>'s
  <ent type='ORG'>Space Research</ent> Corporation was one of the companies that received
  illegal financing from <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> for <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>'s weapons program.
  Such deals helped keep Hussein in power and dramatically
  increased the political tensions throughout the <ent type='LOC'>Mideast</ent>.
  Confident that the arms would keep flowing, Hussein invaded <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>
  in 1980 and <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent> a decade later--conflicts that cost more than a
  million lives.
  But in providing financial services to Saddam Hussein, <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> was
  not alone.  In the <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> affair, for example, <ent type='ORG'>Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>
  transferred $72 million between <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent>.  J.P. <ent type='ORG'>Morgan</ent>, a
  major <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> bank, acted as a clearing agent for <ent type='ORG'>BNL</ent> in the
  loans to <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>.  And many large <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an corporations provided the
  technology and weapons.

  A WHITEWASH?  Fraud at <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> burst into the headlines when bank
  regulators around the world shut down the bank this past July.
  But like the S&amp;L scandal--which wasn't discovered by the
  mainstream media until hundreds of billions of dollars had been
  lost--warning bells at <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> had been going off for well over a
  decade.  As early as the late '70s, <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> and <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent>
  regulators were so worried about the bank's operations that they
  denied <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> key regulatory licenses to expand its operations.  Yet
  <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> marched on, illegally buying <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> banks and stealing
  deposits to cover its huge losses.
  Meanwhile, the Reagan and Bush administrations actively
  obstructed a congressional investigation of the scandal.  A <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent>
  subcommittee chaired by Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) has been
  investigating <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> for several years.  From the start, the
  subcommittee encountered resistance from the administration.  For
  example, <ent type='ORG'>the Justice Department</ent> ordered key witnesses not to
  cooperate with Kerry.  The department also refused to produce
  documents subpoenaed by the subcommittee.
  But these machinations are only part of a much larger political
  scandal--the growing political power of financial institutions
  over every aspect of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> political system.  Over the past
  decade, securities firms, major banks, insurance companies and
  other financial institutions have given more money to <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>
  than any other industry.
  For example, <ent type='ORG'>the Center for Responsive Politics</ent> estimates that
  in the 1988 election, political action committees (<ent type='ORG'>PAC</ent>s) for the
  finance, insurance and real-estate industries gave over $27
  million to congressional candidates.  That's about 26 percent of
  all business <ent type='ORG'>PAC</ent> contributions.  <ent type='ORG'>Common Cause</ent> estimates that
  between 1983 and 1988, the S&amp;L industry gave $11.6 million to
  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and party committees.
  Despite a decade of financial scandals, this well-oiled lobbying
  machine has defeated every major attempt to enact tough new U.S.
  regulations over the financial system.
  In <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>'s case, the result has been a better cover-up than
  anything Oliver North ever concocted.  <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>'s inaction has
  allowed <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> to continue exploiting an obsolete U.S. regulatory
  system that was set up in the
  Some reforms may yet come out of the <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> scandal--but <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>
  and the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> show little interest in fundamental change.
  In fact, the mood in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> is for more deregulation, not
  less.  Sometime this year or next year, <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> is likely to pass
  <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>-sanctioned legislation that will further deregulate
  the banking and financial industry (see "In These <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Time</ent>s</ent>," Oct. 2).
  This legislation, which gives banks new freedom to buy insurance
  companies and set up shop on Wall Street, is designed to help
  <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> banks compete in the international financial system.  But
  by reducing government control, the legislation would simply give
  multinational corporations more power over the world's economy.
  Bringing these corporations under control won't be easy.
  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> could pass laws putting banks out of business if they
  launder criminal money, and it could impose tough economic
  sanctions on offshore havens that refuse to cooperate with U.S.
  regulations and investigations.
  But tough U.S. laws might simply convince financial institutions
  to move their operations overseas, putting many <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent>s out of
  work and making it harder to finance this country's chronic
  government deficits.  It took a group of regulators from five
  major capitalist companies to shut down <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> this past summer.  It
  will take many countries, acting together, to bring the system
  that created <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent> under control.  Given the current political
  climate, that is unlikely.
