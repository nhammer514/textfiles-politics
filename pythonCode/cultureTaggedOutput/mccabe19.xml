<p>   PROGRESS IN CATHOLIC AND NON-CATHOLIC COUNTRIES</p>

<p>   Throughout these ten booklets, in which I have shown that the
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> is the natural ally of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>, <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese</ent>, and
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>s</ent>, I have asked the reader to see it as primarily a vast
economic corporation, the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent>, fighting for
survival, in an age in which educated people despise its doctrines
and all informed people loathe its methods. Whether any, or how
many, of this monstrous regiment of cardinals and bishops, priests
and monks, sincerely believe the medieval sophistication of ancient
<ent type='NORP'>Greek</ent> and oriental superstitions which they profess is here
entirely irrelevant. We are studying the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> as an institution
because we are trying to <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>derstand its action throughout the
world.</p>

<p>   It admits that it seeks wealth and power but insists that this
is only in order that it may more effectively promote what it calls
the spiritual and eternal interests of men. With that pretext also </p>

   THE FRUITS OF ROMANISM</p>

<p>we are not concerned. The apologist will hardly expect us to admit
that it entered into an alliance with (in this order) <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>,
and <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y because it believed they would help it to look after
the soul's of men. Such a plea would raise a broad grin from
<ent type='GPE'>Cologne</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Tokyo</ent>. Those nations sought wealth and power; so did the
Bleak International. They meant to secure and protect this wealth
and power by a regime of bloody tyranny; and the <ent type='LOC'>Black</ent>
International, which has for 800 years relied upon that method,
needed it more urgently than ever. The bandits wanted the
international influence of the Vatican to help to dupe the world
about their designs; and they promised it a very large share of the
spoils of victory by annihilating its critic's and recovering its
lost provinces for it.</p>

<p>   After what we have seen that is as obvious as the Empire <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>
Building. Men of the <ent type='GPE'>M<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ich</ent> mentality as regards <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent></ent>
petulantly exclaim that it is a monstrous charge. Yes: and the war
and the Pope's share in it, the debasement of <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> by priest-
ridden traitors, and the horrors of the <ent type='NORP'>Spanish</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Portuguese</ent> hell
are a monstrous reality. If these narrow-minded folk who think
themselves so superior to prejudice were to look facts in the face
they Would see that we accuse the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> of doing only what it has
done over and over again since the Albiginsian Massacre and the
fo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ding of the Inquisition 700 years ago. They would find that the
<ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> is not the only spiritual army that has
prostituted itself for gold in our time.</p>

<p>   In 1937 there was a <ent type='ORG'>Parliament of Religions</ent> at <ent type='LOC'>Calcutta</ent>. The
report of the proceedings in two fat volumes makes a materialist
like myself blush. Representatives of all the world's religions and
sects joined enthusiastically in the good work, and the speeches
glitter like <ent type='ORG'>Woolworth</ent> jewelry with nice phrases about the
spiritual and the <ent type='ORG'>Ideal</ent>, the sins of men and the wickedness of the
world, the lofty morality by which these folk are going to save the
race. As you will remember, the Japs had by this time completely
enslaved and debauched <ent type='GPE'>Manchuria</ent> and the north of <ent type='GPE'>China</ent> and they
were openly gathering for their next orgy of brutality. And not a
single one of these <ent type='NORP'><ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>tic</ent> word-spinners of the h<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>dred beautiful
religions said one single word about it. One foreigner, a <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>
professor, ventured to say ten very mild words about it.</p>

<p>   If you want to know why, though of course nobody did at the
time, it was not simply because people who live on these shining
heights find it difficult to see the common earth. It was mainly
because the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> or <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese</ent> Buddhism was doing in
<ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent> just what the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> priests were doing in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>.
We must not offend our <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent> fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>   Some of my readers will remember that in 1937, while these
spiritual folk were having their jamboree in <ent type='LOC'>Calcutta</ent> and the
world-press was following their beneficent work with admiration. I
published, through <ent type='ORG'>Haldeman</ent>-Julius, a booklet with the title
Imperialistic <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> and its Aims. I described how by that time the.
criminal plot of the Japs was so far from being secret that scores
of patriotic societies, some with millions of member's, publicly
boasted of it and gloated over realistic pictures and panoramas
exhibited in the stores of the cities, of the destruction of the </p>

   THE FRUITS OF ROMANISM</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n fleet. I gave the evidence that the <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent> priests and
monks, 150000 strong, had been bought by the government and the
capitalists and were conducting an intensive campaign all over
<ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent> to create a Fifth Column for the "<ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese</ent> Liberator's."
They had been bought in cash, just as the Vatican had been bought
by Mussolini, and, like the Vatican, they looked for even greater
profit when the job was done.</p>

<p>   They earned their pay. Not only did they work up the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese</ent>
people to a fanatical enthusiasm for the plan of making themselves
rich by exploiting a third of the world but they created nests of
traitors from <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> Indo-<ent type='GPE'>China</ent> to the <ent type='LOC'>Persian Gulf</ent>. There were
10.000 <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent> quislings in <ent type='GPE'>Rangoon</ent> alone and there were others in
key-positions all over <ent type='GPE'>Burma</ent>. Ceylon teems with them. For ten years
the work has proceeded <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>der a very thin disguise of <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent>
concern for the spiritual interests of men. Yet in a Parliament of
Religions held at <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> in 1939 <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> had been emphatically
warned that these <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent> priests had already grown fat on
imperialist gold.</p>

<p>   While disreputable atheists and materialists like <ent type='ORG'>Haldeman</ent>-
Julius and McCabe, who told the world the truth, were very properly
ignored by all respectable folk these spiritual gasbags, who
blinded it to the realities of life, where loaded with <ent type='ORG'>laurels</ent> and
dollars. It is nice, and so profitable, to be profo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d and
spiritual!</p>

<p>   However. Immense as is the work which I bring to a close with
this booklet I have no space to enlarge, upon even so important a
side-issue as the corruption of Buddhism (which was quite willing
in every age to entertain a business proposition) by the fine
imperialist's of <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>. It is enough that "our two great religions"
have made a mockery of every compliment, that every long-haired
idealist in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> had lavished upon them. They have prostituted
themselves to the <ent type='ORG'>Butchers Union</ent>, while atheistic <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, upon
which most of these idealists have poured abuse for the last twenty
years, has won a splendid tribute from a disillusioned world. But
I have still an important point to make in regard to the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> of
<ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> to complete the explanation of its behavior.</p>

<p>   In his recent work, 'You Can't Be Too Careful,' H. G. <ent type='ORG'>Wells</ent>
says: "The most evil thing in the world today is the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>." It is also one of the most respected things in the world
today, especially in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. But there is no mystery about the
respect, the power, even the adulation which it enjoys. It commands
about 10000000 votes, nicely b<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ched together for the most part
in certain states and at the disposal of the priests. It has
$4000000000 invested, an income of about $1000000000 and an
army of about quarter of a million paid agents of one kind or
other. It has a very large press and radio-service. It has about
5000000 auxiliary troops, open fanatics and secret intriguers,
sworn to promote "the welfare of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>." It has immense
opport<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ities of rewarding loyalty, from a Papal Knighthood to a
job as janitor. It has a control of editors, politicians, writers,
libraries, cinemas, radio programs, owners of halls and theaters,
professors, booksellers, even the police, the public school's,</p>

   THE FRUITS OF ROMANISM</p>

<p>parole-boards, the mails, etc. It has . . . But maybe that will do.
What we had better ask is what excuse is made for themselves by the
politicians, professors, and others who chant the praises of "the
venerable <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>."</p>

<p>   You know it. They reply that the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> does good -- oh, an
enormous amo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>t of good: so much, in fact, that it is one of the
fo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>dations of the state. In a recent book (Mission to <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent>),
which the pious Mr. Gollancz spreads in <ent type='GPE'>England</ent>, Ambassador Davies,
discussing the vices and virtues of <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, says that with all its
faults it must not be classed with <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y and <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, as a
totalitarian state. Phew! Are there still folk who talk like that?
However, what Mr. Davies mean's is that the <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>n state is, and
the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> state is not, "based upon the altruistic principles of the
<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> religion." If that is true of <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> -- if you will
pardon the supposition -- how far more true it must be of the
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n civilization with its 100000 parsons and its more
brilliant exhibition of those principles. And of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>es which
render this inestimable service <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent></ent> is immeasurably
the greatest: the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> that regards all the others with
contemptuous tolerance and prono<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ces them rebellious and
ineffective offshoots of the age-old <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> on which the s<ent type='ORG'>un</ent> never
sets.</p>

<p>   In western stories, of which I am fond, I often read in
descriptions of cow-town of the "false front" of the bank. the
saloon, and the store. The phrase fits the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> In <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>,
for it is, to <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns, the false front of the international Papal
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>. That is why so many <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns hesitate in face of the most
conclusive evidence to admit the charge we bring against the <ent type='LOC'>Black</ent>
International. Why, they say, this is the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> that first raised
the banner of religious freedom on <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n soil: the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> that
gave even <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> the idea of democracies: the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> that
periodically provides the whole world, in Papal encyclicals, with
a guidance on problems of the hour which the press reproduces in
letters of gold: the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> that gathers 350000000 happy and
virtuous folk, without distinction of class, color, or odor, <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>der
its White mantle: the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> that promotes culture and exerts an
inflexible moral rule over the nations.</p>

<p>   That is the false front. In these 20 booklets I have taken you
behind it and shown you the real <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent>. Its apologists lie
outrageously about it. They lie about its political and ethical
principles, its history and its law, its numbers and its quality,
its plots and its open action. They dare not allow the press today
to let the world know the truth about the social condition and the
action of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> in a score of co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries from <ent type='GPE'>Bolivia</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>.
I have proved all this.</p>

<p>   In my long literary career I have written books in strange
conditions -- in the smoking rooms and <ent type='ORG'>Marconi</ent> cabins of liners, in
crowded apartments-houses or on the s<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ny beach, in the bed-rooms
of hotels of all grades -- but I never before wrote, as I have
written these 300000 words, on a battlefield. The National
Library, in which I delve for material, is charred and battered and
almost deserted and the books for which I call come to me sometimes
disfigured by fire or water or fail, and evermore fail, to come...</p>

   THE FRUITS OF ROMANISM</p>

<p>But you can guess all that. I say that in spite of all this these
twenty booklets are from beginning to end just statements of fact,
on incontestable evidence, and they prove that the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>
is, if not "the most evil thing in the world," certainly the most
treacherous and mendacious.</p>

<p>   It may seem that I have reserved to the last the question
which will seem to many the most important: the question what the
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> is worth to the world on a balance of services and
disservices. But I have been replying to that question all through.
Many folk say that they do not care what the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> did in the 4th
Century, or the 13th or the 16th; and there is so much blood and
dirt on the pages of medieval history that <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s often
encourage that feeling, or they would at least like you to believe
that the services they claim -- usually by a gross perversion of
history -- to have rendered were due to a noble spirit which is
ever fresh in the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, while those immense splotches of blood,
those vast areas of servile squalor, and those equally vast areas
of priestly and monastic corruption were just temporary and local
foulings of the garments of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> in the mud of a wicked
world. If you fancy that that childish stuff is really not written
today dip into any <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> book that deals with these matters.</p>

<p>   We might leave the past of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> in its smelly historical
tomb if <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> apologists would let us, but they will not. They
lie heroically about its history, and it is vital to an
<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>derstanding of the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> that we should know that
its writer's lie habitually. In this connection their lies take the
shape of claiming that the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> rendered massive services to
civilization, and it is largely on the gro<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d of these fictitious
services that they demand consideration today.</p>

<p>   Moreover, the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> boasts, and on the whole justly, that it
never changes. It is a strange boast in a world that decidedly
grows in wisdom and sheds innumerable errors as it advances, but it
does at all events justify us in judging what the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> does today
by what it did in <ent type='LOC'>the Middle Ages</ent>, when it was perfectly free to
carry out its principles. When modern Popes are st<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>g into
indiscretion they use just the same language as medieval Popes did,
as we fo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d Plus XI doing in his open letter to Cardinal Gasparri
in 1929. The Canon Law, which is kept in a dead language so that
priests alone can read it, makes the same monstrous claim of a
power over life and death as the medieval Popes made. The
bestiality which the Pope encourages in <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Portugal</ent> today is
the same as Popes encouraged a century ago in the whole of <ent type='LOC'>South</ent>ern
<ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> and in all <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> during <ent type='LOC'>the Middle Ages</ent>.</p>

<p>   No, it is folly to ask us to let dead Popes bury their dead.
This work, however, is concerned with the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> today, and there
is so much to be said about it that I have to avoid history or
confine my short excursions into it within the strict needs of my
present task. So to the question whether the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> has done good
in the past and the race is indebted to it I just say bl<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tly that
practically every claim it makes is fictitious, as I have
exhaustively shown in earlier works, and on balance we must say
that it has retarded the advance of <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an civilization by many
centuries.</p>

   THE FRUITS OF ROMANISM</p>

<p>   I must say a little more than this in regard to what I call
the modern period. I believe that when scholarship and literature
are again free, when the disgraceful power over them of the <ent type='LOC'>Black</ent>
International is broken, historians will date the beginning of the
modern age from the outbreak of the <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> Revolution, The broad
ideal of a just life was then clearly formulated. The revolutionary
armies carried it, with their symbolic tricolor, as far as the
southernmost tips of <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Portugal</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Napoleon</ent>'s,
armies bore the ensign of at least a liberal civilization to the
bo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ds of <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>Naples</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Madrid</ent> were for a time more advanced
than <ent type='GPE'>London</ent>. Latin <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> throbbed with a new passion.</p>

<p>   From that age to ours the outstanding event of history has
been the long-drawn battle for those ideals, and <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> has
throughout been on the side of our enemies. Ever since the bloody
shambles it co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tenanced, if it did not inspire, in <ent type='GPE'>Naples</ent> in 1794
the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> has allied itself with every power, however
corrupt and brutal it was, that took the field against those who
were fighting for the elementary rights of man, for freedom and
democracy. What has happened in the last ten years is simply that
the Vatican, which had been compelled for half a century to profess
in <ent type='NORP'>democratic</ent> co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries that it was reconciled with the new age --
in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> alone the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> has the effrontery to
claim that the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> is the actual source of modern ideals --
became convinced that it had fo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d more powerful allies than ever
in the fight against liberalism, and the war which began in 1798
and in one co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>try or other (especially <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>) has been almost
continuously maintained, has entered upon a new and terrible phase.</p>

<p>   That is the key-idea that you must keep clearly in mind if you
want to <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>derstand the relation of the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> to the world-
war. It is an idea of crucial importance in estimating the world-
situation but no journalistic oracle in <ent type='GPE'>the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent> dare say
it, while what we may call the literary and ethical oracles who,
discuss the more profo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d aspects of the situation will put forward
any fantastic theory, from the growth of materialism to the
diversion of the <ent type='GPE'>Gulf Stream</ent>, rather than risk offending <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s
and injuring their own prestige and circulation, by telling the
plain truth. That this is the plain truth I have shown, as regard's
the last ten years, in these 20 books and for the earlier phase in
larger works, The True Story of the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> and The
A peal to <ent type='ORG'>Reason Library</ent>.</p>

<p>   A third work would be of very considerable use to the modern
reader, especially in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, where, apart from the one or two
brushes with <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>, the historical development has encouraged a
real cultural isolation from <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> as fir as our present theme is
concerned. An <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n writer who visited me some years ago
confirmed me in my suspicion that there is no good and adequate
work available on the mighty struggle in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> in the 19th Century
against the clerical-royalist-capitalist attempts to kill what
survived of the best ideals of the <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> Revolution. For that
matter there is today no work published in <ent type='GPE'>England</ent>, for it would
have to tell the ghastly truth about the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, and in both
co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> uses its new power, not merely to
exclude the truth from literature and education but to see that
false versions of the story of man from 1789 onward are imposed </p>

   THE FRUITS OF ROMANISM</p>

<p>everywhere. In the absence of such a work I can but reiterate that
from 1794 (in <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>) <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>til its present alliance with
Fascism (in <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent>, for instance) the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> has allied
itself with brutal oppressors and enemies of freedom, as I have
ab<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>dantly proved in earlier works, and sum up the evidence given
in this series of booklets in regard to the last ten years.</p>

<p>   It is useful to take a broad view before we look at the
situation more closely. The alleged service of the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> in
promoting civilization can be very so<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>dly tested from this broad
viewpoint. Just glance at the leading co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries of the world and
note in each case what we -- the great majority of men and women in
the best-educated co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries -- would assign as the grade of its
civilization and what proportion of the people the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>
claims to control; and to allow for the present appalling confusion
or violent distortion of conditions we will survey the world as it
was in 1939 and regard only co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries where the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> is
substantially represented.</p>

<p>   Granting that total wealth or size is not of itself a
criterion of civilization there would be general agreement to name
these ten co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries as having attained the highest rank: the United
<ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s, Great <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Switzerland</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Holland</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Denmark</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Sweden</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Norway</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent>. In none of these co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries
does the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> command the allegiance, of more than one-
sixth of the population except <ent type='GPE'>Holland</ent>. where its members and
political representatives are one-third of the whole -- still not
enough to have Influence on the general character -- and <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent>,
where, however, the constructive class is (or was <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>til 1935)
mainly skeptical (and probably still is). <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent> is, in any
case, the one, power whose place in this list would be disputed.</p>

<p>   There would be general agreement to put these co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries at the
lower end of the scale; <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Portugal</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, Eire,
<ent type='GPE'>Brazil</ent>, and most of the smaller <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Republics. In these
the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> claims the great majority of the people and certainly as
regards the constructive forces they are <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries. They
are all <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>, as none of the above ten are, but, for the moment
I am looking at what by general agreement would be called their
grade of civilization. The place of <ent type='GPE'>H<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>gary</ent> might be disputed, but
it is only little more than half <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> and its dictator is not
a <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>Czecho</ent>-<ent type='GPE'>Slovakia</ent> as a whole was in the highest class,
but events have shown that the progressive qualities were in non-
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Bohemia, and that <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Slovakia</ent> is at the level of
<ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent>. I have omitted <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>, which on the gro<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d of recent
accomplishment (reduction of crime and illiteracy, social
legislation, etc.) I should be disposed to put in the first class,
because its place would be warmly disputed. But one thing is not
open to dispute: whatever progress has been made in the last 20
years was due to an anti-<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> body of statesmen and supporters.
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y must be left out of acco<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>t <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>less we go back to pre-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>
days, but even then <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>'s were a one-fourth minority and they
are In large part responsible for the triumph of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>sm and ruin of
the co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>try. In <ent type='GPE'>Belgium</ent> the forces are about equal, and the grade
of civilization corresponds.</p>

   THE FRUITS OF ROMANISM</p>

<p>   You will see the full significance of this if you recall that,
as I said, all these co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries entered upon the great race, as we
may call it, of the last 150 year's with much the same equipment of
ideals. The <ent type='ORG'>Revolutionary</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>Napoleon</ent>ic armies, beating a path
for <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> literature, made those ideals familiar from <ent type='GPE'>Portugal</ent> to
<ent type='GPE'>Sweden</ent>, and Latin <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> was awakened from one end to the other by
the echoes of the struggle. Even <ent type='GPE'>Ireland</ent> had quite a notable body
of <ent type='NORP'>Deists</ent> and humanitarians (Robert Emmet, Wolfe Tone, and many
others) amongst its educated men in the last years of the 18th
Century. It has none today or not one who dare open his lips, and
the co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>try remains, with all its political and religious pride,
poor, squalid, ignorant, and of inferior general character. in
other words, every co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>try in which the influence of the <ent type='ORG'>Papacy</ent> was
paramo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>t failed to advance in the path that was indicated by those
new ideals of civilization which we all regard as so<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d. But the
co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries in which <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> had no such influence or where, as in
<ent type='GPE'>France</ent>, it lost its power, joined the predominantly <ent type='NORP'>Protestant</ent>
co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries in advancing to the higher rank. That is the first reply,
and it is perfectly so<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d from the sociologleal angle, to the claim
that the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> promotes civilization.</p>

<p>   Chapter 11</p>

<p>   THE BLACK INTERNATIONAL ALWAYS IN THE REAR</p>

<p>   In this general survey I have repeatedly referred to the
ideals of freedom and democracy. For most of us these are partial
expressions of the modern spirit, the demand for justice, which, in
alliance with the advance of science, has lifted the ten co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries
I named to the highest rank. The attempt of <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> writers in
various co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries to represent them as mere political claims, or
even as a liberalism, that the world has tried and fo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d wanting,
are mere excuses to cover the Vatican's alliance with Fascism or
the <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> Encyclical of the Pope <ent type='ORG'>Quadragesimo</ent> Anno. It must be
<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>derstood, however, that I have not assigned these 20 nations
their place in the scale of civilization on that test. If one
proposed to do this it would be simple and accurate to say that all
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries are now <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> and all <ent type='NORP'>democratic</ent> co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries are
non-<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>. But it is more convincing if we apply a broader test
of civilization.</p>

<p>   The <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> apologist would define the service of his <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>
by saying (first and chiefly) that it defends the family, that it
trains all people whom it can influence in general moral character,
that it preaches and insists upon justice, individual and social,
and that it is zealous for education and philanthropy. And since,
he would say, the family is, according to very many if not most
sociologists, the fo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>dation of the state, the particular zeal and
rigorous measures of his <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, which distinguish it in an age of
growing laxity, must especially recommend it to the statesman and
the social student.</p>

<p>   <ent type='ORG'>Piffle</ent>, as usual. The <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> has three distinctive
features in its teaching about the family. First, it insist that
its priests, monks, and n<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>s shall not marry and shall not have any
recognizable families; and since the implication of this is that 
sexual commerce has some sort of taint even where it is licensed</p>

   THE FRUITS OF ROMANISM</p>

<p>one does not see how we can speak here of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> guarding this
particular fo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>dation of the state. Secondly, it alone amongst the
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>es -- in fact, it shares this distinction only with a few
groups of the lowest savages on earth -- forbids divorce; and since
this harsh restriction of human rights has either, as in <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries, to be alleviated by the general use of mistresses or
brothels, or it amo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ts to a positive deterrent from marriage, we
again fail to perceive any service, and no statesman of any of the
leading civilizations has any respect for the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>'s teaching on
this point. The law of divorce which now exists in every
civilization except those of lower grade that are subject to the
Pope is based upon the collective recognition of social experience
and upon a mature adjustment of the rights of the individual and
the needs of the state. The <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> opposition to it professes to
be based upon some words of an ancient <ent type='NORP'>Jewish</ent> prophet of which we
have two contradictory versions in the records and which other
<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>es, of equal scholarship and greater sincerity,
find compatible with divorce. It is in any case really based, as I
showed, on the fierce determination of the Popes of the early
Middle Age's to get complete control of life. On such frivolous and
anti-social gro<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ds does this particularly strident claim of the
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> to render human service rest; and our contempt deepens when
we find the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> playing fast and loose with its "indissoluble
marriage" when its own interest or profit is involved, as I showed
in my analysis of the clauses of the Canon Law and the practice of
the Papal Courts.</p>

<p>   Thirdly, the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> boasts that it renders a
<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ique service to the state because it is the only <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> or
institution that condemns, and very fiercely condemns birth
control. The <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> is as usual, out of date. For the
last ten years it has shared that distinction with the criminal
leaders of the <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>, <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese</ent>, and <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> people. They wanted
soldiers and the excuse of over-population to cover their
imperialist greed. The <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> wanted more contributors
to its <ent type='ORG'>treasury</ent> and, as priests have admitted, to beat rival
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>es by outbreeding them. The clerical opposition to birth
control is, in fact, such an obvious piece of priestcraft and has
so little fo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>dation even in their own weird and wonderful theology
that they confess (as I quoted), the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> laity in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> are
to an alarming extent ignoring their sulphuric orders and
restricting their families: which makes their "social" argument
look rather anaemic.</p>

<p>   The apologists have recently been encouraged by the appearance
of a new school of opponents of birth control whose leaders and
statements are not religious. These professors and their learned
lady friends recognize that the old opposition was based upon a
demand for as many soldiers as possible and that the industrial and
professional markets are, in normal times and in capitalist
co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries, already overcrowded. They say that the really so<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d
scientific plea is that the birth rate is so far falling out of
balance with the death rate that there will soon be a debilitating
preponderance of old folk over yo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>g. They do not take into acco<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>t
the fact that science and common sense are steadily raising what we
may call the vitality-period of men and women. I could write
caustic pages on my own recent experience in being rejected (as one</p>

<p>in senile decay) from all departments of the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> national
effort by men whose laziness, short hours, and easygoing methods
are notorious, But I have space only for one point. <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> has
practiced birth control for more than half a century almost as much
as <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> or <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent> does today. But it was not old men who let
<ent type='GPE'>France</ent> down. It was a few <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> old men, who were pushed into
office by these priests who are so concerned about the vitality of
civilization, <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> adventurers like Laval and Bonnet, and
yo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ger statesmen who were seduced by <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> mistresses.</p>

<p>   In short, all this rhetoric about <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> marriage and the
social welfare is hypocritical claptrap, and every statesman and
social student knows it. Every state finds in time its equilibrium
on gro<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ds of experience in sex-matters. Sex-laws and restrictions
that are based upon ancient philosophic's or religions, ultimately
upon more ancient taboos and superstitions, merely distract
attention and hamper the social activity. Apologists for them have
to repeat outdated and thoroughly exposed statements about the ruin
of older civilizations by vice. Five year's ago most folk would
have said that the two most vigorous nations were the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> and
the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n, and both enjoyed an advanced degree of sexual
freedom. Today we should say that <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> are the most
vigorous nations. But according to the priests the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n people
are only restrained from a monstrous parade of sex, in their books,
pictures, and theaters, by the severe paternal cheek of the clergy,
while <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> has always had a liberal divorce law and for quarter
of a century has denied that marriage is a sacrament and birth
control a sin.</p>

<p>   For reasons -- reasons of self-interest -- which I discussed
in an earlier book <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> apologists have always put this sex and
marriage-business in the forefront of their statement of claims. It
more or less excises the absurd official virginity of their
priests, monks and n<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>s: It evokes a golden echo in the hearts of
rich widows and spinsters: and it really does mark a distinction
between the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> and "the world." In theory, that is to say. And
not only is the theory itself an antiquated ethic rehabilitated for
priestly purposes, so that those who profess to lead civilization
are far in the rear of modern thought, but in practice <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s
are no more "moral" than other folk. I leave it to my readers'
knowledge of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n life what the situation is in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, saying
only that I have a very extensive familiarity with the best
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n fiction of a realist character and that I have made
extensive inquiries during the two years (at intervals) I have
spent in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. But for "<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries" you may take as
typical the pleasant exaggeration which Byron wrote when he saw a
statue of <ent type='GPE'>the Virgin Mary</ent> in a <ent type='NORP'>Portuguese</ent> city: "Well do I ween the
only virgin there." He had probably made inquiries.</p>

<p>   Apologists obstinately insist that <ent type='NORP'>Irish</ent> girls are remarkably
chaste," though I have for 30 years given proof and bitter
complaints of English <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s (including leading priests) that
the <ent type='NORP'>Irish</ent> girls are sent to <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent> to drop their burdens and keep
down the record of illegitimate births in Eire. A <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> attorney
writes me, or wrote me 30 years ago when I took up the question,
that the same complaint was made in the New <ent type='GPE'>England</ent> <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s. Sanger

<p>interrogation of 2000 <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> prostitutes he fo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d that 977 (706
of whom had been born in <ent type='GPE'>Ireland</ent>) had had <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> parents, and had
been brought up as <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s. The <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Times (May 31, 1924)
quoted Canon Hughes, one of the highest <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> authorities,
saying that 60 percent of the prostitutes of <ent type='GPE'>Liverpool</ent> -- one of
the most <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> and most vicious cities in <ent type='GPE'>England</ent> -- were <ent type='NORP'>Irish</ent>
and only 30 percent English. Ten years later another <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
expert, Mrs. Ellison, stated in a book that the situation is the
same in the cities of <ent type='GPE'>London</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Glasgow</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Newcastle</ent> (big centers
of <ent type='NORP'>Irish</ent> immigration). A leaflet on the subject issued by the
<ent type='NORP'>Protestant</ent> Truth Society (<ent type='NORP'>British</ent>) gives a mass of <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
testimony and replies to the charge that illegitimacy is 3.4
percent in <ent type='NORP'>Protestant</ent> Ulster and (for the above reasons) only 0.7
in <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Connaught</ent> that it was at the time 9.30 in <ent type='GPE'>Belgium</ent>,
14.89 in <ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent>, 15.67 in <ent type='GPE'>Bavaria</ent>, and 50.00 in <ent type='GPE'>Guatemala</ent>. Since
emigration was checked the <ent type='NORP'>Irish</ent> have not boasted so much. I quoted
an editorial in the <ent type='NORP'>Irish</ent> Times (J<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>e 12, 1937) describing a
disgraceful official record of sex-crimes in <ent type='GPE'>Co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ty Clare</ent> which is
in <ent type='ORG'>Connaught</ent>!</p>

<p>   This chastity-talk is not only outdated from the ethical and
sociological angle but it supported by a remarkable variety of
<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>truths. And if it is suggested that the real service of the
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> lies in promoting morals or character in the broader sense
the reply to just as devastating. This plea is just a relic of the
old and purely rhetorical assertion that a religious basis is
required for so<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d conduct. The sufficient reply is that, I have
repeatedly shown, the general level of character in the leading
civilizations has risen in the same proportion as <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> influence
has decayed. For the moment we are not concerned about cause and
effect. The fact is enough. As my friend Mr. E.S.P. <ent type='ORG'>Haynes</ent>, a
distinguished <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> attorney, has written -- and he is approvingly
quoted by Julian Huxley in his Religion Without Revelation (P. 52):
"If morality did really depend on other worldly sanctions, the
religious changes of the last fifty years would by now have
dissolved society at large." What has happened is much the same as
with the old superstition that it is <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>lucky to pass <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>der a
ladder. People now see that a good reason for not doing it is that
the man who does not keep clear of a ladder raised against a
building is apt to get drips of paint or bricks dropped on him. In
the same way they discover that so<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d moral law is a sanitation-
regulation of the social life.</p>

<p>   The irony of paying attention to the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent>ist version of the
old apologetic, which is the noisiest of them all, is that the
Papal <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> promotes so<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d character even less than the other
<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>es. Middle-class folk, to which class most writers
belong, argue on these matters in the most slovenly fashion. Their
acquaintance with <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s is confined to their class, and in this
they meet many <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> men and women of admirable character. So,
they lazily conclude, <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>ism molds character. Middle-class men
who are not puritans have insisted to me -- two of them were
attorneys -- that they find <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> girls easier to persuade or
less in need of persuasion than other girls. But let us remember,
the nature of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> as I analyzed it. Of the 100000000 or so
adult subjects of the Pope at least 80000000 have not the least </p>

<p>resemblance to the middle-class <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n or <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>. Half
of them are imperfectly civilized Latin <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns (with <ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent> and
the <ent type='GPE'>Philippines</ent>) and most of the remainder are illiterate or poor
and ignorant <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Spaniard</ent>s</ent>, <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>s</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>Portuguese</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>Slovaks</ent>, etc.</p>

<p>   The general level of character in a nation is an elusive
factor but it is fairly determined, if we make allowances for
police-conditions, by the volume of crime. Criminal behavior in the
extreme form of <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>social conduct, and the number of criminals is a
good indication of the amo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>t of <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>social conduct generally. If,
therefore, we find, as we do, that <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries are more
criminal than non-<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>, and that as a mixed co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>try a quite
disproportionate number of the criminals are <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s, we must
conclude that the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> is no more effective in inspiring so<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d
social behavior than in securing the chastity about which it talks
so much.</p>

<p>   I have given a few statistics in book No. 13. As <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s are
apt to contest this I may add a few more. In No. 23 of his
Questions and Answer (p. 87) <ent type='ORG'>Haldeman</ent>-Julius gives, from a book by
a <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> prison chaplain (Fr. Leo Kalmer, Crime and Religion) a
most damning series of figures. The priest ascertained from his
colleagues the percentage of <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s in 36 <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n
penitentiaries and the result extends to the whole of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> the
truth disclosed in the figure's I gave for Sing Sing (48.50 percent
in <ent type='GPE'>Joliet</ent>, 46.92 in <ent type='GPE'>San Quentin</ent>, 57.31 in <ent type='GPE'>Auburn</ent>, 63.64 in
<ent type='GPE'>Wethersfield</ent>, etc.). Analysis by the Rev. L.B. Lehmann brings out
the fact that in 28 states, in which <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s are 17 percent of
the population, they are 33 percent of the criminals. The whole
article in <ent type='ORG'>Haldeman</ent>-Julius' book should be read.</p>

<p>   The only other mixed states for which exact comparative
figures are available are <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Commonwealth</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent></ent> and the
Dominion of <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>. In the case of <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent> the figures are
particularly interesting because the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> has as much power
there as in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> and is just as blatant in its claims. It is 36
years since I first reproduced the full figures relating to crime
and <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>ism in that co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>try, and I have brought them up to date
every few years. They are as damning as those of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, yet
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s continue to claim in the most brazen manner that they
guard the fo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>dations of the state by promoting character.</p>

<p>   <ent type='ORG'>The <ent type='GPE'>Queensland</ent> <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> Schools Defense F<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d</ent> issued a leaflet
quoting the figures from the official publications. This showed
that in <ent type='GPE'>Victoria</ent> in 1936 the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> prisoners numbered 2164,
whereas since the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s are only 18 percent of the population,
their ought to have been only 754 <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> prisoners if their moral
quality was equal to that of non-<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s. In <ent type='GPE'>New <ent type='GPE'><ent type='LOC'>South</ent> Wales</ent></ent> they
had 454 prisoners instead of the 145 to which their percentage of
the population entitled them. In <ent type='GPE'>Queensland</ent> the disproportion was
the same. In the <ent type='ORG'>Commonwealth</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s, mostly <ent type='NORP'>Irish</ent>, had three
times the number of criminals they ought to have had if they were
as good as and no better than their neighbors. As <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s in
<ent type='GPE'>Queensland</ent> had just published a new demand for the preferential
treatment of their schools, the <ent type='NORP'>Protestant</ent>s retorted humorously
that they ought themselves to receive preferential treatment in the
matter of taxation because they maintain extra police and jails to
look after <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> criminals.</p>

in <ent type='GPE'>Melbourne</ent> (<ent type='GPE'>Victoria</ent>). Shortly afterward's the Report of the

percent of the population: the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>England</ent> 40 percent: the
<ent type='NORP'>Methodist</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Presbyterians</ent> 14 percent. But the arms of the <ent type='LOC'>Black</ent>
Octopus are everywhere, strangling freedom and truth, from the
office of the cabinet minister or the trade <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ion to the editorial
office and the public libraries.</p>

<p>   Most co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries do not now publish the figures of the religious
professions of criminals, and full figures of crime in <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> and
non-<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries are not so easily obtained as one would
suppose. Few sociologists or criminologists omit to mention the
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, and prominently, amongst the agencies which make for social
sanity and stability, but, though it will be <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>derstood that my
acquaintance with such literature is not complete, I do not know
one of them who dares to follow this up by examining the statistics
of crime and the profession's of criminals or the religious status
of the various co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries.</p>

<p>   The article "Homicide" in the Encyclopedia of the Social
Sciences has a little merit in this connection. It quotes Ferri's
table showing the reduction of it in recent times in five of the
leading <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries by giving the percentage per 100000 of
the population:</p>

<p>and was not reduced when the Vatican made its corrupt bargain to
share the control. <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> were both predominantly <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
in the last century when they had such a high record of the gravest
crime, and the modern sociologist scorns the excuse of "the hot
blood of the south." I question the figure for <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, as there
was no "<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y" only a number of separate states -- <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>til 1871.
Bodis (in Mulhall's Dictionary of Statistics) gives this percentage
of trials for murder in 1876-84: <ent type='GPE'>United Kingdom</ent> 12, <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y 14,
<ent type='GPE'>France</ent> (still mainly <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>) 23, <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent> 105, <ent type='GPE'>H<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>gary</ent> 107, <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>
134. Add these to the figures I gave in No. 13, and you get such a
reply to the claim that <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent>ism promotes a high standard of
character that you wonder that any apologist has the effrontery to
make it.</p>

<p>   But all <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s make it, and very emphatically, because it
is the only excuse they can provide for the politicians,
professors, and writers whom, in one way or other, they get to
praise the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> and deno<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ce critics. If this claim is so
decisively disproved by the only exact test we can apply -- the
volume of crime in <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> lands and the proportion of criminals
in mixed lands -- so decisively that no sociologist in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>
thinks it prudent to discuss the matter, where must we look for
even a plausible bit of color for it? The language of Papal
encyclicals and the gorgeous comments of apologists on them suggest
that there might be more sincerity in the claim that the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> is
more effective in inspiring social justice. We will defer the
examination of this to the next chapter, but the reader will be
prepared to smile. Social justice in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Vichy</ent> <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Portugal</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Brazil</ent> as compared with <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Denmark</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Sweden</ent>, or <ent type='GPE'>Switzerland</ent>! It so<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ds like a bad joke.</p>

<p>   But what other test can we apply? Is the great 'service of the
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> that it provided, or moved the authorities to provide, free
education for the children of the workers? See the table of
steatitic of illiteracy which I gave in No. 13 (p. 21). They are
more damning than the statistics of crime or illegitimacy. Our
search for these massive social services of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> begins to
remind us of that naughty definition of metaphysics -- looking in
a dark room for a black cat that isn't there. Let us, in order to
be quite just to our <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> fellow-citizens, approach the subject
in a different way.</p>

<p>religions" in drenching the planet with mud and blood ought to make
these prophets of the spiritual feel small, but I notice in the
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n press that they are as cocky as ever, and our Joads in
<ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent> orate at <ent type='ORG'>Empire Pageants</ent>. These people have nearly a
monopoly of the after-the-war planning which absorbs all our finer
spirits just now. They would return to just that distracting
activity of theirs <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>der cover of which Japs and <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>s shifted
the attention of the world from the real evils that menaced it.</p>

<p>   The world was making a very creditable progress on most lines
of a real advance of civilization, though it was checked by the
interests of wealth and religion, <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>til the privileged folk and
their politicians were duped into thinking that the <ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> and Tang
(or yellows) were merely accumulating power in order to annihilate
the <ent type='ORG'>Reds</ent>. This progress became appreciable about 1870, when the
United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s settled down after the Civil War and <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>
triumphed, in most co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries, over the vicious clerical-royalist
reaction that had followed the fall of <ent type='ORG'>Napoleon</ent>. Briefly, the
period characterized not merely by an advance of from 1870 to 1914
was characterized, not merely by an advance of applied science
which more than doubled the wealth-reducing capacity of a nation
but by the employment of a very large part of the new wealth to
create systems of <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>iversal free education, an immense
multiplication of free libraries, the establishment in most
co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries of fully <ent type='NORP'>democratic</ent> political regimes and the
enfranchisement of women, factory-legislation, schemes of old-age
pensions and health and <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>employment insurance, sanitation, re-
housing, and other measures which doubled the average expectation
of life, a considerable growth of temperance (or temperateness),
and great reduction of crime, the doubling (generally) of real
wages, the enormous improvement of hospitals and services for the
distressed, and the spread of an anti-war sentiment.</p>

<p>   Some say that that is a materialistic conception of progress.
Most men and women in 1914 would have said that they did not care
a damn what you called it but that -- if they read a candid acco<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>t
of life before 1870 -- the world, in spite of its lingering
defects, was a very much better place to live in. But let me again,
in passing, point out the humbug of this "spirit" and "matter"
business.</p>

<p>   I have just been reading, dreary as the occupation was, one of
those numerous recent works on the beauty of modern high-brow
Buddhism and how it will save the world. Out of the mush of
Verbiage I picked the general statement that the <ent type='ORG'>Supreme</ent> aim of
Buddhism is "the extinction of suffering." F<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ny. That is exactly
the supreme aim of atheists and materialists. I pointed out years
ago that progress is not to be judged by some misty goal in the
clouds but by the success of a nation in reducing suffering. And
while a certain number of people in every generation can be
persuaded to lessen the risk of suffering for themselves by
despising the wicked world and its wine, women, and song, and
retiring to a semi-nudist colony to contemplate their navels --
which seems to be Buddhism -- it seems to us atheists and
materialists far better to remove or reduce as much as possible the
sources of suffering (disease, poverty, war, ignorance, etc.) for
millions of people.</p>

   THE FRUITS OF ROMANISM</p>

<p>   Talking of our navel-contemplators, I fancy you will find a
little irrelevance well worth inserting here. I do not know whether
you ever came across a priceless book published nine years ago by
Professor T. O'Conroy. It ought to have been reprinted in 1938 and
scattered by the million over <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, at the time, when the Japs
were spending millions a year in lying propaganda. O'Conroy lived
in <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>, teaching in one of the leading <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>iversities, for 15
years. He married an aristocratic <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese</ent> lady and was more
intimately admitted to <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese</ent> life than any other white man. And
in 1933 he wrote this scalding indictment of the nation, showing
that for corruption, cruelty, and <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>scrupulousness the Japs could
not be beaten. Buddhism, he shows, fully shared this corruption,
though it was at that time -- the government had not yet invited it
to prostitute itself to the national greed -- a fat, indolent, and
useless body. But what I want to quote is an illustration of its
corruption which he gives (pp. 87-8) and which, sensational as it
is, like the similar revelation in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> monasteries, I have not
seen reproduced or referred to since in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n literature or
journalism.</p>

<p>   A few mile's from <ent type='GPE'>Tokyo</ent> was a large and rich monastery of what
was <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>derstood to be the very strictest sect of <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent> monks.
They were so holy that they closed their doors against the wicked
world and wanted to be alone. But in their extensive gro<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ds there
was a home for feeble-minded women, tended by the good monks, and
a rumor spread in <ent type='GPE'>Tokyo</ent> that numbers of these <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>fort<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ates were
just <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>wanted wives whose husbands paid the monks to take them
over. A <ent type='GPE'>Tokyo</ent> paper organized a raid in 1928, and though the police
at once suppressed it, published an amazing story. The <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent>
monastery was a colony of sadists, just as the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Franciscan</ent>
friars were fo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d to be colonies of sodomists. When the raiders
burst in they fo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d the monk-keepers gambling and squabbling with
blood-splotched paper money, while the women, half mad or half
dead, lay about, mutilated, exhausted, fouled with the monks'
excrements. Women were chained even in the temple, and rape, sexual
mutilation, and ignominy were but a few of the foul performances
that took place." And this is the second greatest "spiritual"
religion of our time: the religion over which our idealists and
scorners of materialism go into ecstasies!</p>

<p>   Like the monasteries in the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> provinces of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y and
the more <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> republics of <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> and Central <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> and the
<ent type='GPE'>Philippines</ent>, these <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent> monasteries -- O'Conroy says that
decent <ent type='NORP'>Buddhist</ent> priests told him that 60 to 80 percent of their
body were corrupt -- illustrate what is always likely to happen in
medieval conditions; that is to say, wherever the monastery is
surro<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ded by a drowsy or drugged population of believers free from
the taint of heresy. It was the normal condition of <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
monasteries throughout <ent type='LOC'>the Middle Ages</ent>, and it lingered, as in
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Portugal</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>Spanish</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, and the
<ent type='GPE'>Philippines</ent>, wherever this parasitic <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> atmosphere lingered.
This is the first broad proof that the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> was taught sense and
virtue by what it calls the wicked world or the materialistic age.</p>

<p>   An examination of the progress and the causes of social reform
in each co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>try would clinch this proof, but obviously a
satisfactory treatment of that subject would require a large 
volume; and, as it is one of those inquiries that the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> does</p>

   THE FRUITS OF ROMANISM</p>

<p>not like, no historian or sociologist has taken it up and there is
no work to recommend to the reader. I have, as some readers will
know, not only given a large amo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>t of material for the study in
previous works but have written one in which enough of the evidence
is condensed to satisfy any candid inquirer (How Freethinkers Made
Notable Contributions to Civilization, <ent type='ORG'>Haldeman</ent>-Julius Co. 1938).
In this work I examined the record of progress, particularly during
the last 100 years, in respect of the struggle for freedom,
education, social and political rights, the emancipation of woman,
philanthropy, and general improvement, and I showed that, while in
those days religious folk, though by no means so lenient to
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s as they now are, at least thought them an immeasurably
larger and more respectable body than freethinkers, yet fully one
half the pioneers in all reforms were freethinker's and none were
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s.</p>

<p>   You wonder what <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> apologists, loudly claiming that the
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> leads in progress and civilization, say to that. The answer
is: Nothing, as far as I can discover. I have several times quoted
a very popular apologetic work, published <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>der the patronage of
heads and professors of several <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>iversities, entitled The
Calvert Handbook of <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Facts. It ought to say "of <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
Rhetoric" or "<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> Lies." It makes the usual generalized claims
but, as the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> must have exerted this mighty influence on
progress and civilization through definite individuals, the leaders
of chief workers in reform-movements, I look for the names of these
-- and find none. There is a lot about <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> relatives of
Presidents, rich <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> men of business, <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> diplomatists,
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> judges, and so on, but for every <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> named as a
worker in reform-movements I will <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>dertake to name a h<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>dred
skeptics.</p>

<p>   There is in the book an article on <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s who contributed
to <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n civilization in particular or civilization in general.
It names Sobieski, whose monument is <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent>, Ferdinand and
Isabella, whose monument is <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, and the discoveries of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>,
who would have gone to the stake if they had not professed
<ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent>ism. That covers the later Middle Ages. Then we have a Father
White, who is said to have set up the first printing press (from
<ent type='GPE'>England</ent>) in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, another who was great at shorthand in its
infancy, another who invented a balloon; and another who (getting
the idea from <ent type='GPE'>England</ent>) built the first railroad in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. Two or
three are credited with naval and military distinction, and there
is the usual b<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ch of great <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> scientists (Pasteur, Fabre,
etc.) most of whom were skeptics. There are the men who wrote
"<ent type='GPE'>Maryland</ent>" and "The Conquered Banner," the architect of the White
House, the man who sold the estate for it, and the man who planned
the city of <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> (a "majestic plan"). There you have the
sweepings of three centuries, from <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> as well as <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. They
do not represent a small body of <ent type='NORP'>Quakers</ent> or still smaller body (at
that time) of freethinkers but the biggest religion in the world.</p>

<p>   Did anybody ever say that no <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> ever won any sort of
distinction, even in shorthand, ballooning, or writing songs? We
are familiar with <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s writing any sort of tripe for their own
hypnotized people, but this sort of thing is written for non-
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns and has the patronage of Nicholas Murray Butler </p>

<p>and the President of <ent type='ORG'>the Carnegie Institute of Technology</ent>. The
great work for civilization was achieved from 1870 onward. How many
of these illustrious <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s fall in that period? Only the
balloonist as far as I can see. We may admit that gas and hot air
are entitled to clerical respect, but what the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> apologist,
claims is the inspiration of our progress in education, the
reduction of social service. How many of crime, and poverty, and
suffering these brilliant men figure in those fields? Not one.</p>

<p>   Let us try another way. As the Jesuits are supposed to have
inspired <ent type='GPE'>Jefferson</ent> and Adams, who loathed Jesuits and their creed
as much as <ent type='ORG'>Haldeman</ent>-Julius does, perhaps it will be claimed that it
was the subtly compelling influence of Papal encyclicals that
permeated the world and somehow fired large bodies of men and women
(mostly skeptics) to devote their lives to ridding the world of its
medieval evils and miseries. This would be very singular when we
reflect that of those who are supposed to be the closest readers of
the encyclopedias, the priests, not one -- <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>less you want me to
co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>t Father Coughlin -- figures in the long list of reform-
leaders, and not one <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> layman is fo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d in any list of, say,
the h<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>dred leading social workers of the 19th Century. The
influence of religion on leader's of reform is one of those studies
which our sociologists carefully avoid, though most of them give
religion a high-place in the list of inspirational agencies, but I
have made the research elsewhere, and the grotesque scratchings in
the byways of history of the Calvert Handbook confirm me. The Papal
encyclicals moved the world to great deeds and through atheists and
<ent type='NORP'>Quakers</ent>! Really, apologists ought not to advertise so blatantly
what they think of <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> intelligence.</p>

<p>   But what are these grand encyclicals (or "to the whole world")
letters of the Popes on social matters. Even a <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> would beg
me not to go too far back, so let us begin about the beginning of
the modern progressive period. Pius IX (of "Blessed Memory," the
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> writer always adds, though <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>s</ent> who knew him have
written some f<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ny things about him) opened the series in 1864 with
the encyclical <ent type='ORG'>Quanta cura</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>Syllabus</ent>. Your apologists now
never mention it. He, having still at that time the reactionary
<ent type='NORP'>French</ent> emperor to protect him against the wicked <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>s</ent>, scorched
the whole reform-movement with the choicest Papal invectives. He
put "liberalism," which we now call pink tea, on a level with
Satanism, which is several notches lower than rape.</p>

<p>   Then came the great encyclical-writer Leo XIII. He was as fond
of writing encyclicals as <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>ill is of writing speeches. Two of
them are still gorgeously praised -- and falsely interpreted -- In
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> literature. But just keep your eye on the dates
and the historical backgro<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d. Leo won the tiara in 1878, when the
reform-movement was full on in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> he knew only as a
raw outpost of civilization -- I suspect he knew it mostly from
Dickens's Letters and Martin Chuzzlewit -- and he had many a brush
with its bishops, but he did follow social and political movements
in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>. Yet it was not <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>til thirteen years after his accession
that he issued the first encyclical which the most ingenious
apologist can call socially inspiring. He had not been silent. In
1878 he had issued an encyclical cursing Socialism root and branch.
Next year he had imposed the medieval "philosophy of Aquinas on the</p>

<p><ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> world. In the following year he had th<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>dered at the
world, which was reforming its marriage-laws, that divorce was a
mortal sin (except in the ingenious form in which rich <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s
can get it from <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent>). In 1881 he pointed out, apropos of the
assassination of the Tsar, that these appalling outrages were due
to the decay of religion (not, of course, to the bestiality of the
<ent type='NORP'>Tsarist</ent> regime), and in 1884 he put <ent type='ORG'>Freemasonry Under</ent> the ban. In
1885 he issued the Immortale Dei, which Ryan still applauds as a
fine <ent type='NORP'>democratic</ent> appeal; and I have shown that it is nothing of the
kind. In 1888 he savagely attacked the claim of religious freedom
and liberty of discussion. It was not <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>til 1891, when he saw
Socialism gaining gro<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d rapidly at the expense of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, that
he issued the one encyclical, Rerum novarum, which <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s claim
to give a lead in social reform; and the only "revolutionary"
sentence in it was the statement that the workers must have a
living wage. (which he refused to define), which had been a
platitude of liberal literature for half a century. And in his last
beautiful messages to the world he retracted this and died
sputtering the most reactionary sentiments.</p>

<p>   I pass on the next two Popes. Ryan does not quote them. They
were stuffy and ill-informed reactionaries all their lives. And in
1931 the late Pope, or the present Pope writing in his name issue
the <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> encyclical <ent type='ORG'>Quadragesimo</ent> anno which the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> and
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n hierarchies dare not translate into English! It opened the
blatantly <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>, conspiratorial, warmongering career of his
"holiness" Pius XII.</p>

<p>   Need I point the moral? The <ent type='ORG'>Papacy</ent> was throughout the whole
period the enemy of progress of the rights of the people. It was
just compelled for a time to temporize because it looked even to
these owlish <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>s</ent> priests as if democracy had won its war and
the world was adopting the liberalism in social matters which the
Popes scorned. Yet even when concessions had to be made to check
the leakage of millions of workers from the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> they took only
the feeble form of saying that if the <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> people really insisted
on having a republic they might, provided it kept the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> established by law and that capitalists must grant their
workers a "just wage," which it was left to them to determine.</p>

<p>   What do I mean then, you will ask, by saying that the wicked
world educated the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>? The Popes apparently, never were
educated in so<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d views of social ethics. What I mean is that in
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, and <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> a social-<ent type='NORP'>democratic</ent>
movement (without the capital letters) spread in the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> world
after 1900. Quite bold books appeared, and there were "social
experts" and all sorts of novelties. What was the inspiration?
Evidently it did not come from the <ent type='ORG'>Papacy</ent>. Had local hierarchies
and their <ent type='NORP'>Ryans</ent> and Williams a finer appreciation of the
implications of the faith than the Holy-Ghost-inspired Pope's and
all the great theological geniuses of <ent type='LOC'>the Middle Ages</ent>?</p>

<p>   Enough of this nonsense. The plain truth is that after leaving
it to non-<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s for a century, when the work was heart-breaking
and the penalty often death or jail, to break the paths of social
and humanitarian reform, the local <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> in some
co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries concluded that in the interest of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> they must </p>

<p>join in the work. It was a death-bed repentance. But the patient
recovered. That is to say, the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent>, which for a
time had despaired of life on the old lines of privilege and
autocracy, saw a new hope in the rise of Fascism and became
convinced that it was going to conquer the world. So the death-bed
confession of sin was torn up in <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> and in all co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries that
passed <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>der the pirate-flag, and it is only in one or two
co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries like <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>, where democracy may survive and
may even regain the world, where in any case <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s are a
minority and must behave like the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> or <ent type='GPE'>Oregon</ent>,
that one still hears how freedom and democracy are grand old
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> ideas conveyed to a wicked and despairing world by the
august, and fearless, and <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>-compromising encyclicals of the Popes.</p>

<p>   Chapter  IV</p>

<p>  THE CONTRAST OF <ent type='GPE'>RUSSIA</ent> AND PRIEST-RULED COUNTRIES</p>

<p>   While the services rendered by the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> to civilization are
as hard to find as the black cat in a dark room, the services it
rendered to the repulsive forces which have attempted to wreck
civilization are as plain as the peaks of the <ent type='ORG'>Rockies</ent>. The
alliances contracted by the Vatican with <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>, and <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y
are events of recent history like the New Deal or the Atlantic
Charter. The dates and terms of the agreements are public property.
But one service requires special consideration: the organization of
the entire resources of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> to engender hatred of Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ism
in general and of <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> in particular.</p>

<p>   This service began, explicitly as far as the documents I have
seen tell us, in 1936, though the Vatican had beg<ent type='ORG'>un</ent> its furious
attack upon Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ism and even, in effect, its appeal for a crusade
against it, much earlier. From 1919 to 1924 the Pope was, we saw,
straining, every nerve to get on friendly terms with <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>
so as to bring <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>der his control the Orthodox <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> when its
leaders were scattered. The <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>ns repeatedly detected the
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> clergy in treachery and in 1924 closed the co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>try against
missionaries from <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent>. So in December of that year Pius XI, who
had hitherto in great charity kept in check his hatred of
Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ism, attacked it in his Consistorial Allocution (December 18)
and called the attention of all "heads of "governments" to the
danger of it. He, in fact, coupled Socialism with Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ism as
equally dangerous. In 1931 he, we saw, ordered all <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> states
(in encyclical <ent type='ORG'>Quadragesimo</ent> anno) to adopt the <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> state and
sternly forbade <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s to take up either Socialism or Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ism.
He said that Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ism had brought "massacres and ruin upon Eastern
<ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>." This attack on <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> seems to have been taken up or
fostered by his representatives everywhere, as on December 30,
1932, the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> Daily Worker said that "the clergy of all creeds
and denominations are, with religion as their pretext following the
lead of the Pope in his call for a crusade against the U.S.S.R."</p>

<p>   The direct and more pointed attack began, however, in 1936,
shortly after the outbreak of Franco's rebellion in <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>. We must
remember that <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y were not at that time open allies
of Franco, and <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent> had not declared their attitude </p>

   THE FRUITS OF ROMANISM</p>

<p>to what everybody still called a rebellion. But there was no
reserve at <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent>. In a blistering and most <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>truthful attack on
Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ism, which he represented as the aggressor in <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, the Pope
spoke of it as a force that was attempting to subvert established
order of every kind from <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>China</ent>, from <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent> to <ent type='LOC'>South</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>." From this year onward he appealed repeatedly for "the
extinction" of <ent type='NORP'>Bolshevism</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, and, as we
saw, "he holy cry for blood was taken up in the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> section of
every co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>try.</p>

<p>   When the <ent type='GPE'>Czecho</ent>-<ent type='GPE'>Slovakia</ent>n crisis, which might be called the
first stage of the world-war, arose in 1938 the service that the
Vatican and its <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> in every co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>try had already
rendered the imperialist thugs by this propaganda was apparent.
<ent type='ORG'>Joint</ent> action at once by <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> would have
strangled Hitlerism in its cradle and put a cheek to the ambitions
of <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>. But <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent> was <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>der obligation only to support <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>,
and <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> was persuaded by its <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> politicians and military
leaders, the present <ent type='GPE'>Vichy</ent> crowd, that <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> could not be trusted
to keep its word: in reality, that active partnership with so
disreputable a power and helping it to cheek the strength of
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y must not be <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>dertaken by <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>. As late as 1940 <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>
generals of the stuffy <ent type='NORP'>Tory</ent> type were saying: "We may have to ally
our selves with <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, but God forgive us." That contemptuous
attitude the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> <ent type='ORG'>fed</ent> in every co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>try for ten
years, to the very great profit of the bandits.</p>

<p>   We admit the double root of this hatred of <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, or the
capitalist and the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> roots, but we have to recognize this
difference: that the capitalists, who make no pretence of moral
principle, are honest opponents of a dangerous rival system,
whereas the priests, who profess to be the moral saviors of a
wicked world lie about their motives and by their action r<ent type='ORG'>un</ent> the
risk of bringing upon civilization precisely that ruin which they
<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>truthfully accused the Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ists of contemplating. The Pope's
outburst in 1936 which I quoted in an earlier book and which was
clearly written by the present Pope as Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>, was a
tissue of <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>truthful charges. Instead of trying to "subvert
established order of every kind" by "an <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>-parallel confusion of
forces so savage and cruel as to have been thought utterly
incompatible" -- whatever the last phrase may mean -- <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> had by
1936, as the whole world knew, wrought a miracle of the creation of
order out of chaos. In 1923, as a result of the <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an War, the
Civil War, and the great famine, <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> had been reduced to a
condition of disorder and misery which had not been seen in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>
since the end of the Thirty Years War (1648). The restoration began
in earnest a few years later, and by 1936 the most respected writer
of <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> reported, with a few reserves, that the
<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> government had, especially in regard to the reduction of
crime and the establishment of social order, won a remarkable
victory.</p>

<p>   Apologists in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> had generally, to be less wild than the
Pope in their indictment of <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, but they were reckless enough.
The old lies about the massacre of priests and the persecution of
religion flourished in <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> literature from year to year; in
fact, there is good gro<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d to believe that the official </p>

   THE FRUITS OF ROMANISM</p>

<p>representatives of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> demanded assurances on the latter point
when they began to negotiate with <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> about military aid. The
conspiracies in which some of the leading <ent type='NORP'><ent type='ORG'>Bolshevik</ent>s</ent> were involved
were eagerly snapped up as proof that the co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>try was ruled by a
murderous bureaucracy, whereas we now have the weighty assurance of
Duranty (with a reserve in one case) and Ambassador Davies that the
men were certainly guilty. Davies himself repeats a perennial libel
in saying that the <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>ns are lamentably inefficient as compared
with the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns and the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>. He has had the cruel experience
of seeing his book appear, with this reproach, just at the time
when the world had proof before it daily of the relative efficiency
of the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> and the <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>n military machine.</p>

<p>   There are two plain reasons for the sacred fury of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>
against <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, and the first is entirely discreditable. It is
because the attack upon <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> brought the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> into
line with wealth and privilege in accordance with its old and
<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>wavering tradition. For an attack upon the Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ist political
system the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> has no gro<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d whatever since it declares that it
never interferes in politics. And when it plans its attack on
economic gro<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d's it recognizes that it can make no distinction
between Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ism and Socialism, since the degree of socialization
is not a matter of moral principle. But its claim that any moral
principle at all is involved is ludicrous. Ryan is very eloquent on
the moral right of private ownership: he is, in fact so sure of it
that he says a <ent type='NORP'>Socialist</ent> government would be a violation of moral
law, and <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns would be justified in rebelling against
it. <ent type='ORG'>Piffle</ent>. A people has a right to choose its economic form just
as well as its political regime. The apologists who talk like this
are simply saying to the world's capitalists: The <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> is
your friend so help to protect it from further decay.</p>

<p>   The second and stronger reason is the tremendous loss which
the spread of Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ism had inflicted upon the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>. I gave
the facts in the first book. The press and most writers conceal
them and leave the fierce hostility of <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> not very
intelligible and cover up the vast amo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>t of harm that the Vatican
did by spreading it's hatred over the world, yet <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> itself is
much more ready to admit this motive than to talk about its support
of the capitalist system. It, of course, does not speak of losses.
With its usual complete indifference to truthfulness it invites the
world to <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ite against <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> because it "attacks religion." All
criticism of the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> or telling the people the truth
about its history and its aims is "an attack" but criticism by the
<ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> of other <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>es or philosophies is, however acrid and
<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>truthful it may be, just a kindly warning to the world of the
dangers that surro<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d it.</p>

<p>   We may readily admit that for many years the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> government
gave every assistance to the vol<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tary organization that opened the
eyes of the people, but this official cooperation had ceased at the
time when the Vatican was shrieking about attacks on religion, and
in the other co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries (<ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, and <ent type='NORP'>Spanish</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, etc.) in which the advance of Socialism and Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ism
detached tens of million# from the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> there was certainly
no official encouragement of the movement. The mechanism of
propaganda was a substitution of facts for lies, of knowledge for </p>

   THE FRUITS OF ROMANISM</p>

<p>ignorance. The policy of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> when the <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> reaction began
in each co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>try sufficiently proves this. It closed the schools,
suppressed freedom of discussion, and strangled literature; and it
filled the jails with the men and women who had been most prominent
in exposing the clergy, and it had, and continues to have,
thousands of them labelled Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ists and shot.</p>

<p>   We talk about the blindness of men in the red haze of war, but
the third year of this most terrible of all war's has been, to the
intense mortification of the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent>, a year of
illumination. Self-interest has, of course, helped the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> and
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns to surmo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>t the prejudices that have been pumped into
them by press, pulpit, literature, and the cinema for 20 years, but
it will hardly be questioned that the magnificent conduct of the
<ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>n people has been the main fact that opened the eyes of folk
to their great qualities and the so<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>dness of their system. Right
<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>til the hordes of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> tanks, set free by the absence of any
opposition on the western front, were within a few hours r<ent type='ORG'>un</ent> of
<ent type='GPE'>Leningrad</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent>, Britons and <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns were whispering that of
course the <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>n people would not fight with real devotion and
the requisite energy for a government that usurped power, treated
them despotically and mercilessly, and robbed them of their
previous religion. Novels, the class-books of so many millions,
still circulated in which the <ent type='ORG'>Commissars</ent> and leading officials were
represented as sadistic monsters who lived on champagne, caviar,
and <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> virgins.</p>

<p>   History has rarely seen such a revulsion of sentiment, such a
triumph over two decades of priestly and aristocratic slander, as
has happened in the last six months. <ent type='NORP'>Conservative</ent> leaders now speak
in public about "our noble <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>n ally," and deputies from <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>,
who only six months ago were admitted at the back doors, so to
speak, are received with royal hands. And it is only in the last
few months that the press or most of it -- many papers still crab
at <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> and frown on the popular enthusiasm -- has supported the
change of heart. In <ent type='GPE'>England</ent> most of the cinemas still treat <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>
as a power which it would be indecent to obtrude upon the notice of
a <ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> people. Bands at Anglo-<ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>n f<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ctions are forbidden
to play the Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ist national anthem, and rich if small
organizations continue to publish the old libels. But, the facts
have for the vast majority of people swept away the long-standing
prejudices as the first warm rains of spring wash away the snows.</p>

<p>   The next step will be for the public to reflect how it has
been systematically duped over a long series of years. The share of
the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> in this has been so conducted that most
people are <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>aware of it, but the truth slowly emerges and <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent>
shudders. The Pope, we saw, already puts out rumors that in his
intimate circle he, from the first, drew a sharp distinction
between what he blamed in <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, which was virtuous on the wrong
gro<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ds, and what he blamed in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y and <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>. But no one has
read a line in which he gave a straight moral condemnation of the
<ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>s and the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s -- he never blamed more than their
interference with the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> and the attempt to annihilate <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent> -- whereas the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> authorities themselves translated
and circularized the vicious, vitriolic speech on the Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ists of
<ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, which he delivered on September 14, 
1936, (The <ent type='NORP'>Spanish</ent> Terror).</p>

shines, and even <ent type='GPE'>China</ent> wins honor and admiration: the two chief
co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries in which the Pope had seen the activity of the devil:
<ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent>, the Land which his shining <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> crusaders were going to

"nobles" and politicians do actually carouse in <ent type='GPE'>Madrid</ent> as the

<p>   <ent type='GPE'>Portugal</ent>, we saw on the authority of a writer whom <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n
<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s had imprudently recommended as veracious, is a co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>try in

<p>   <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, dragged at the heels of Hitler's bumping chariot, is in

<ent type='GPE'>Switzerland</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Turkey</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent> -- are genuinely neutral, but,
however clearly we may <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>derstand the difficulties of their
position, no one regards it as an honorable distinction. The rest
of the civilized world is divided into co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries which live <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>der
the most hated emblems the world has seen for many centuries -- the
Swastika and the Rising S<ent type='ORG'>un</ent> (for <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> writhes <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>der the former of
these) -- and co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries which are sworn to bring them down to the
dust.</p>

<p>   Apart from Latin <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, which is, as I said, distracted
between its Papal assurances and the discovery of the perfidy and
brutality of the Pope's allies, all <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries fall in the
first category. Their national flags where they still have any,
are, if not deeply stained with dishonor, generally regarded with
contempt or a pity that is tinged with disdain. There can be few
more miserable statesmen in the world than Eugene Pacelli, or His
Holiness Pius XII. Ten years ago he pledged his <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> to a belief
in the ultimate victory of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>. In the ruin
of all liberal, as well as <ent type='NORP'>Socialist</ent> and Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ist, ideals which
they would effect no strong voice would be raised in protest,
against his alliance with a bestial greed that sought to attain its
end's by brutality almost without precedent in history. His
gauleiter and his gestapo would, as always, loyally support the
Vatican policy. The end justifies the means. As to the mass of the
faithful, when did any large body of them ever rebel when Pope and
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> were <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ited in their policy? And in the
glorious extension of the power and wealth of the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, the
annihilation of its deadliest enemies, which the Pope anticipated
from the victory of Swastika and the Rising S<ent type='ORG'>un</ent> few <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s would
be in a critical mood.</p>

<p>   In the second stage of the war, when the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>s, finding
nearly all <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> in their power and confident of Subduing the
remainder, began to disclose their real sentiments about <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> --
which the Vatican ought to have learned from Mein Kampf 20 years
ago -- and proposed to share the world with <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> only, the Pope
had a new dream. It suited the interests of the Vatican just as
well as it was to the interest of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y that <ent type='LOC'>South</ent>ern <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> </p>

<p>should have its industries destroyed. Big industries mean clotted
urban populations, free discussion, freethought, birth control, and
so on. The Vatican had seen that painful development in <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Belgium</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Czecho</ent>-<ent type='GPE'>Slovakia</ent>. The <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> was
ready to join in the plot to de-industrialize those co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries and
let <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y glow rich by a monopoly of industry, in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>. Petain,
with the priests at his elbow, openly mumbles it, in his senile
honesty, and has within the last month closed down a thousand
industries in <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>. Leopold of <ent type='GPE'>Belgium</ent> and his <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
satellites, Franco, and Salazar cheerfully send their skilled
workers to <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y or to the <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>n shambles. Hitler would allow
a <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> League of <ent type='LOC'>South</ent>ern <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>, and through <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent> and
<ent type='GPE'>Portugal</ent> the 100000000 folk of Latin <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> would be drawn into
it. Hitler promised the Subjection to the Vatican of all branches
of the <ent type='NORP'>Greek</ent> and Oriental <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>es. <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> promised a monopoly of
<ent type='NORP'>Christian</ent> missions (if thoroughly <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ized) in <ent type='LOC'>the Far East</ent>. . . </p>

<p>   That these were the plans on which the Vatican worked I showed
on <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> admissions and by the plain testimony of facts in the
first ten booklets. Already the vast field of <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> triumph is
a scorched earth. The Pope is ill, silent, desperately watching the
last critical phases of a conflict that, <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>less it be won speedily 
by the <ent type='ORG'>Axis</ent>, will inexorably be lost. From those windows of the
Vatican Palace which look out upon the world he sees only one flag
waving above the ruins <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>sullied: the Hammer and Sickle. <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>
has won respect by the courage and endurance of her people but,
after a series of retreats that are rare in <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> history, has
still to, and doubtless will, redeem the honor of its flag. There
is a stain on the Stars and Stripes that has yet to be removed.
<ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>. has made no large bl<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ders but has met the initial impact
of an irresistible force and the loss of vast fertile provinces and
great industries and has beg<ent type='ORG'>un</ent> its recovery with a devotion,
energy, and self-sacrifice that have torn the Pope's libels to
tatter's. Bring on your stage today representative figures of all
the Pope's peoples -- the pale and ragged <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>, the ga<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>t
<ent type='NORP'>Spaniard</ent>, the illiterate and poverty-stricken <ent type='NORP'>Portuguese</ent>, the
shame-faced <ent type='NORP'>Belgian</ent> or <ent type='GPE'>Vichy</ent> <ent type='NORP'>French</ent>man, the hesitating Latin
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n -- and at the end of the file bring on a <ent type='ORG'>Bolshevik</ent>, and
listen to the judgment of the audience. What the Pope cursed the
world blesses: what he blessed the world curses. The Pope has lost.</p>

<p>   But, aside from the fact that in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> the <ent type='LOC'>Black</ent>
International is powerful enough to hide this truth from the mass
of people, remember that the Pope has lost dozens of times before,
yet he has today more subjects than ever, immeasurably greater
wealth, and a new power in non-<ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries.</p>

<p>   A week ago a powerful <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> air-fleet bombed <ent type='GPE'>Cologne</ent>. I had
wondered how long it would be before this was done. Here was one of
the most vital and most vulnerable bottle-necks in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>. Through
it passed practically all the war-supplies from <ent type='GPE'>Holland</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Belgium</ent>,
and Northern <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>. Thoroughly smash the railway through the city,
where it approaches the <ent type='GPE'>Rhine</ent>, and the great bridges, and you deal
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y a terrific blow. But -- I once spent five or six weeks in
<ent type='GPE'>Cologne</ent> -- the cathedral is close to the railway and the bridges.
It was <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>hurt, and who will believe that the vital part of the
railway and the bridge which carries it over the river, which are </p>

   THE FRUITS OF ROMANISM</p>

<p>only a few h<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>dred yards from the cathedral, were properly treated
if no bomb strayed across the square? I hear that, at the prayer of
<ent type='NORP'>British</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s, our airman were told to r<ent type='ORG'>un</ent> no risk of touching
the cathedral.</p>

<p>   Why was <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> never bombed? There were times when this was
within our power, and it might have had a very considerable
influence on our fort<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>es in the <ent type='LOC'>Mediterranean</ent> area. H.G. <ent type='ORG'>Wells</ent>
asked me the other day if I knew why it was not done. I do not
know. These things are not put on paper, and if they were the paper
would never see the light. But there is a grapevine, and the
message went along it that through Roosevelt <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s
threatened things, and there were <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> threats in
parts of the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> Empire, if we bombed <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent>. Mussolini probably
patted his Papal friend on the back.</p>

<p>   However these things may be, remember that <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> has many times
in history seemed to be doomed because of its Papal alliances with
brutality, but it recovered. About 850 years ago the <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent>s
themselves drove one of the strongest of the Popes into exile for
such an alliance. In 1527 <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> armies wrecked <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> as <ent type='NORP'>Goths</ent> and
<ent type='ORG'>Vandals</ent> had never done. Early in the 19th Century, a contemporary
tells us, <ent type='ORG'>Napoleon</ent>'s generals, entering <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> and carrying off the
Pope, decided that this was to be the end of the <ent type='ORG'>Papacy</ent>; and not
many years later Macaulay made his foolish prediction that there
would still be a <ent type='ORG'>Papacy</ent> when visitors from <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> came to see
the ruins of <ent type='GPE'>London</ent>.</p>

<p>   I dislike prediction's, and indeed I have accomplished the
work which I set out to do in this series of books. I proved to the
hilt the indictment I brought against the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent>, and
I have now shown that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent></ent> is of such a nature, so
dangerous in its structure and so feeble in its intellectual
appeal, that it is bo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d to look for such allies in every age. A
third line of evidence is fo<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>d in Papal history, especially during
the last century and a half. Violence has always -- I do not know
if this was in the protocols given by Jesus to Peter -- been the
policy on which the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Black</ent> International</ent> relied. The Popes merely
kept the weapon tucked <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>der their cassocks during the few decades
between the death of feudal tyranny and the birth of totalitarian
tyranny. The leopard does not change its spots, but it may have
them white-washed.</p>

<p>   Nevertheless I may conclude with a glance at the future. This
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>-<ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese</ent> horror shall and will perish. As I write there is
still time for a serious setback to <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, or <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, or
all three. I have never been tempted to <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>derrate the ability of
the men who, behind the miserable tinfoil Siegfried and his greedy,
friends, direct the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> effort or the c<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ning and lean energy of
the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese</ent>. If this serious advance of the <ent type='ORG'>Axis</ent> does not occur in
the next few weeks we may breathe freely. Within, two further
months the retreat will begin. The end, this year (if <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent> opens
a second front) or next, is certain.</p>

<p>   What will <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> do? Remember first that comparatively few
people know the story of its guilt. A few <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n papers have at
intervals reported Vatican events which suggested it. The vast 
majority of the leading papers, both in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>, never </p>

   THE FRUITS OF ROMANISM</p>

<p>gave any news which gave their readers an inkling of the truth.
Fort<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ately, much had been reported -- the compact with Mussolini,
the Concordat with Hitler, the enthusiastic support of Franco, the
diplomatic arrangement with <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>, and so on -- before the
bestiality of Fascism had revealed itself, and such facts as that
the only vol<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tary "crusaders" against <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> are from <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>
co<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>tries and the <ent type='ORG'>un</ent>converted isolationists of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> play up
strongly to the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> minority, give us a basis in the Public
mind for a proper education.</p>

<p>   It is therefore probable that there will not be the general
outcry against <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent> that a man who has read the full evidence
would. expect. No other writer of influence has the courage and
honesty to warn the public, as <ent type='ORG'>Wells</ent> does, that instead of having
been reconciled with the modern spirit <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent></ent> is as
dangerous an enemy of civilization as ever. One thing only would
cause the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> the deepest alarm: if the victory of democracy
were to put Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ism and Socialism back in the places they
occupied years ago. Will this happen?</p>

<p>   It depends very largely upon <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. When the war is over the
isolationists will be amongst the loudest to demand that <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>
shall have a leading voice in the settlement of <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>China</ent>.
Every sensible man will welcome the aid of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> in such a
restoration of <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> that, instead of sowing the dragon's teeth as
we did at Versailles at the close of the last war, we have every
guarantee that is humanly possible of a lasting peace. But the
terms of settlement that have been so far anno<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ced are ominously
vague, and we know only too well what "stability" means on the lips
of these folk.</p>

<p>   You will find, when the time comes, that the Vatican will make
a brazen attempt to secure a voice as one of the great stabilizing
forces. You will find <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent>s everywhere combining with the
reactionaries who want to plan the new <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>. They will want
Leopold restored, men like Bonnet put in power in <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> Franco
firmly established in <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent> and Salazar in <ent type='GPE'>Portugal</ent>, the royal
family propped on the throne of <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, and so on. By hook or crook
they will try to get <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, which will have won the war in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>,
excluded from the settlement. They will insist that religion be
"strengthened," knowing that <ent type='NORP'>Roman</ent>ism,, Buddhism, and <ent type='ORG'>Islam</ent> have
worked on the side of our enemies, and that Comm<ent type='ORG'>un</ent>ism be taken at
the Pope's valuation. If the present generation tolerates these
things and does not insist on the guilt of every party being
stamped upon the mind of the world they will deserve their future.
The struggle for the rights of man which has reddened <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> with
blood for a century and a half will enter upon a new phase.</p>
