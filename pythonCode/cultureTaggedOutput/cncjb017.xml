<p> SHADOW OF THE <ent type='ORG'>SWASTIKA</ent>:</p>

<p> The Real Reason the Government Won't Debate Medical Cannabis and 
Industrial Hemp Re-legalization</p>

<p> An Open Letter to All <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent> By R. William Davis </p>

<p> Documented Evidence of a Secret Business and Political Alliance 
Between the U.S. "Establishment" and the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> - Before, During and 
After World War II - up to the Present. </p>

<p> PREFACE </p>

<p> Before the Gatewood Galbraith for Governor Campaign in 1991, few 
<ent type='NORP'>Kentuckians</ent> knew that the plant that the federal government had 
demonized for over 50 years as "<ent type='ORG'>Marijuana</ent> - Assassin of Youth," was, 
in fact, Cannabis Hemp, the most traded commodity in the world until 
the mid-1800s, and our state's number one crop, industry, and most 
important source of revenue, for over 150 years. </p>

<p> Today, thanks to the efforts of pioneer hemp researchers and public 
advocates such as Galbraith, Jack Fraizer, Jack Herer, Chris Conrad, 
Ed Rosenthal, Don Wirtshafter and others, the federal government's 
unjustifiable suppression of our state's right to develop our most 
valuable and versatile natural resource, is facing increasing 
opposition from an informed public. Hemp is now recognized as the 
number one agriculturally renewable raw material in the world, and 
perhaps the only crop / industry which can guarantee us industrial 
and economic independence from the trans-national corporations. </p>

<p> "Shadow of the <ent type='ORG'>Swastika</ent>" is a follow-up to my earlier work, 
"Cannabis Hemp: the Invisible Prohibition Revealed," which I wrote 
and published in support of the Galbraith Campaign. Since 
publication of that booklet, there has been growing public 
acceptance of the evidence that <ent type='ORG'>Marijuana</ent> Prohibition was created in 
1937, not to protect society from the "evils of the drug <ent type='ORG'>Marijuana</ent>," 
as the Federal government claimed, but as an act of deliberate 
economic and industrial sabotage against the re-emerging Industrial 
Hemp Industry. </p>

<p> Previous investigations by hemp researchers have been limited to 
the suppression of free-market competition from the hemp industry, 
and focused on the activities of three prominent members of 
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s corporate, industrial and banking establishment during the 
mid- to late-1930s: </p>

<p> WILLIAM RANDOLPH <ent type='ORG'>HEARST</ent>, the newspaper and magazine tycoon.</p>

<p> The expected rebirth of cannabis hemp as a less expensive source of 
pulp for paper meant his millions of acres of prime timberland, and 
investment in wood pulp papermaking equipment, would soon be worth 
much less. In the 1920s, about the same time as the equipment was 
developed to economically mass-produce raw hemp into pulp and fiber 
for paper, he began the "Reefer Madness" hoax in his newspaper and 
magazine publications.</p>

<p> ANDREW <ent type='ORG'>MELLON</ent>, founder of <ent type='ORG'>the Gulf Oil Corporation</ent>.</p>

<p> He knew that cannabis hemp was an alternative industrial raw 
material for the production of thousands of products, including fuel 
and plastics, which, if allowed to compete in the free-market, would 
threaten the future profits of the oil companies. As Secretary of 
the <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent> he created <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Bureau of Narcotics</ent>, and 
appointed his own future nephew-in-law, Harry Anslinger, as 
director. Anslinger would later use the sensational, and totally 
fabricated, articles published by <ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent>, to push the <ent type='ORG'>Marijuana</ent> Tax 
Act of 1937 through <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, which successfully destroyed the 
rebirth of the cannabis hemp industry. </p>

<p> A prominent member of one <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>ional subcommittee who voted in 
favor of this bill was Joseph Guffey of <ent type='GPE'>Pennsylvania</ent>, an oil tycoon 
and former business partner of Andrew Mellon in the <ent type='ORG'>Spindletop</ent> oil 
fields in <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>.</p>

<p> THE <ent type='ORG'>DU PONT</ent> CHEMI<ent type='GPE'>CA</ent>L CORPORATION,</p>

<p> which owned the patents on synthetic petrochemicals and industrial 
processes that promised billions of dollars in future profits from 
the sale of wood pulp paper, lead additives for gasoline, synthetic 
fibers and plastics, if hemp could be suppressed. At the time, du 
Pont family influence in both government and the private sector was 
unmatched, according to historians and journalists.</p>

<p> This publication, however, reveals documented historical evidence 
that the suppression of the hemp industry was only one key part of a 
much larger conspiracy in the 1930s, not only by the three corporate 
interests named above, but by many others, as well. </p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>ional records, <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> reports and investigations by the 
<ent type='ORG'>Justice Department</ent>, during the 1930s and 1940s, have already 
documented evidence of this wider plot. A list of the corporations 
named include <ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent>, <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent>, and <ent type='ORG'>General Motors</ent>, all of 
which were proven to be conspiring with <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> industrial cartels to 
eliminate competition world-wide and divide among themselves the 
<ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent>'s industrial resources and commercial markets, for profitable 
exploitation. </p>

<p> This conspiracy succeeded. It is now obvious that this lack of 
serious competition in the industrial raw materials market caused 
our present - and totally contrived - addiction to petrochemicals. 
Its success is directly responsible for the most troubling problems 
we now face in the 1990s; serious damage to our environment, 
concentration of economic and political power into fewer and fewer 
hands, and the weakening of the rights of individuals and states to 
determine their own futures. </p>

<p> It is more and more evident that, given the historical record, the 
structure of the New World Order is being built upon the Foundation 
of <ent type='ORG'>Marijuana</ent> Prohibition, and only the relegalization of free-market 
hemp competition can save us.</p>

<p> INTRODUCTION </p>

<p> To clearly understand the circumstances which existed during the 
1930s and 1940s, and are the subject of this booklet, it would be 
helpful to first put the hemp / petrochemical conflict into 
historical perspective. The events which took place in the years 
leading up to World War II were a continuation of a struggle between 
agricultural and industrial interests that began before the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
Revolution, a struggle which has yet to be decided, even today. </p>

<p> AGRICULTURE VS. IND<ent type='GPE'>US</ent>TRY </p>

<p> The historical record, at least as it has been presented to us in 
the public school system, is that the Civil War was fought to end 
slavery. This is not the whole story. The truth of the matter is 
that it was also a clash between <ent type='NORP'>Northern</ent> industrialists and 
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='LOC'>South</ent>ern</ent> agriculturists, over control of the expansion into the 
newly opened <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>. </p>

<p> In 1845, Abraham <ent type='ORG'>Lincoln</ent> wrote, "I hold it a paramount duty of us 
in the free states due to the union of the states, and perhaps to 
liberty itself, to let the slavery of other states alone." (1) </p>

<p> Concerning the <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>ern territories, he said "The whole <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent> is 
interested that the best use shall be made of these territories. We 
want them for homes and free white people. This they cannot be, to 
any considerable extent, if slavery be planted within them." (2) </p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Lincoln</ent> was caught in the middle between the <ent type='NORP'>Northern</ent> 
industrialists and the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='LOC'>South</ent>ern</ent> agriculturists, who both wanted to 
dominate <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>ern expansion because of the wealth it offered. The 
industrialists knew that the agriculturists depended on slavery 
because cotton, upon which <ent type='NORP'><ent type='LOC'>South</ent>ern</ent> wealth was based, was very labor 
intensive and required the inexpensive labor that slavery provided. 
They knew that if the <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>ern lands were declared "free states" then 
the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='LOC'>South</ent>ern</ent> agriculturists would be unable to compete, and would be 
forced to leave <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>ern expansion, and its potential profits, to the 
<ent type='NORP'>Northern</ent> industrialists. </p>

<p> Quoting "The Irony of Democracy," by Thomas R. Dye and T. Harmon 
Zeigler,</p>

<p> "The importance of the Civil War for <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s elite structure was 
the commanding position that the new industrial capitalists won 
during the course of the struggle. . . . The economic transformation 
of <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent> from an agricultural to an industrial nation 
reached the crescendo of a revolution in the second half of the 
nineteenth century. </p>

<p> "Civil War profits compounded the capital of the industrialists and 
placed them in a position to dominate the economic life of the 
nation. Moreover, when the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='LOC'>South</ent>ern</ent> planters were removed from the 
national scene, the government in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> became the exclusive 
domain of the new industrial leaders." (3)</p>

<p> The <ent type='NORP'>Northern</ent> industrialists used this increased capital to build 
the system of transcontinental railways, linking the <ent type='LOC'>Northeast</ent> with 
both the <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>. The labor for this undertaking was from the 
<ent type='LOC'>Northeast</ent>ern Establishment's own source of cheap labor - recently 
freed slaves and poor immigrants from <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>China</ent> - who 
suffered under living conditions which were often little better than 
those which existed under the Slave System just a few years before. </p>

<p> It was during the years between the Civil War and the beginning of 
the Twentieth Century that the <ent type='NORP'>Northern</ent> industrialists altered the 
role of the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n government. Originally established by the 
Revolution to protect and preserve the lives, property and freedoms 
of all <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent> from repressive government, it was transformed into 
an agency to protect the economic future of <ent type='NORP'>Northern</ent> industrialists. </p>

<p> "[T]he industrial elites," according to Dye and Zeigler, "saw no 
objection to legislation if it furthered their success in business. 
Unrestricted competition might prove who was the fittest, but as an 
added precaution to insure that the industrial capitalists 
themselves emerged as the fittest, these new elites also insisted 
upon government subsidies, patents, tariffs, loans, and massive 
giveaways of land and other natural resources." (4) </p>

<p> The struggle between <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>ern farmers and the railroads owned by the 
<ent type='NORP'>Northern</ent> industrialists is a good example. To protect their 
interests, citizens created "the <ent type='ORG'>Grange</ent>," an organization which 
helped to enact state laws regulating the "ruthless aggression" of 
the railroads. In 1877, these laws were upheld by <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent></ent> 
in the Munn v. <ent type='GPE'>Illinois</ent> decision. But, a few years later, Justice 
Stephen A. <ent type='ORG'>Field</ent> changed the role, and the very definition, of the 
corporation. He gave a new interpretation to the Fourteenth 
Amendment that actually gave corporations legal status as citizens . 
. . as artificial persons. (5) </p>

<p> It was not long after this change in the interpretation of the 
Fourteenth Amendment that John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, the father of the 
modern-day corporation, created the great <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent> Corporation</ent> 
which, by the late 1880s, gained control over 90% of all the oil 
refineries in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. (6) </p>

<p> The roots of 20th Century <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n politics can best be illustrated 
by the 1896 Presidential Election, won by <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> William 
McKinley by a landslide. The McKinley campaign was directed by 
Marcus Alonzo <ent type='ORG'>Hanna of <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent></ent> and raised a $16000000 
campaign fund from wealthy fellow industrialists, (an amount that 
was unmatched in Presidential campaigns until the 1960s). The major 
theme of the campaign, and one that would echo far into the future, 
was "what's good for business is good for the country." (7) </p>

<p> This emerging political and judicial misuse of power in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> was 
feared by Thomas Jefferson who, in 1787, wrote, "I think our 
governments will remain virtuous for many centuries; as long as they 
remain chiefly agricultural; and this will be as long as there shall 
be vacant lands in any part of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. When they get piled upon one 
another in large cities as in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> they will become corrupt as in 
<ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>." (8) </p>

<p> It is important to remember that the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Revolution was a 
clash between the agriculturists in the colonies, and the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> 
industrialists who controlled the government in <ent type='GPE'>England</ent>. Almost 100 
years later the Civil War was fought as a continuation of the same 
basic struggle, but with the victory going back to the 
industrialists. This began the erosion of the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n government 
"of the people, for the people and by the people." The buying of the 
1896 Presidential Election, by <ent type='ORG'>Hanna of <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent></ent> and the 
<ent type='NORP'>Northern</ent> industrial interests, was the next important step on the 
long road to the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n government "of the corporation, for the 
corporation and by the corporation." </p>

<p> A few years later, World War I would forge an even closer 
relationship between corporations and government in the United 
<ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s, as well as around the world. Anthony Sampson, in his book 
"<ent type='ORG'>The Arms Bazaar</ent>," notes that "the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n companies, led by <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> 
Steel and <ent type='ORG'>du Pont</ent>, were transformed by war orders. <ent type='ORG'><ent type='GPE'>US</ent> Steel</ent>, which 
had absorbed <ent type='ORG'>Carnegie</ent>'s old steel company, had made average annual 
profits in the four pre-war years of $105 million, while in the four 
war years they were $240 million; and <ent type='ORG'>du Pont</ent>'s average profit went 
up from $6 million to $58 million. . . . </p>

<p> "Certainly the arms companies had become much richer through the 
war, and there were widespread suspicions that they were actually 
trying to prolong it." (9) </p>

<p> The bottom line is, of course, victory or profit, and in what 
proportions? To what lengths would this nation's top industrial 
leaders go to secure their share of the profits before and during 
the next "war to end all war?" </p>

<p> U.S. CORPORATIONS AND THE <ent type='ORG'><ent type='NORP'>NAZI</ent>S</ent> </p>

<p> "A clique of U.S. industrialists is hell-bent to bring a fascist 
state to supplant our democratic government and is working closely 
with the fascist regime in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>. I have had plenty of 
opportunity in my post in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent> to witness how close some of our 
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n ruling families are to the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> regime. . . . </p>

<p> "Certain <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n industrialists had a great deal to do with 
bringing fascist regimes into being in both <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>. They 
extended aid to help Fascism occupy the seat of power, and they are 
helping to keep it there." - William E. Dodd, U.S. Ambassador to 
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>, 1937.(1)</p>

<p> A large volume of documentary evidence exists that reveals that 
many of the richest, most powerful men in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>, and the 
giant corporations they controlled, were secretly allied with the 
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>, both before and during World War II, even after war was 
declared between <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>. This alliance began with U.S. 
corporate investment during the reconstruction of post-World War I 
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> in the 1920s and, years later, included financial, 
industrial and military aid to the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>. </p>

<p> On the pages which follow we will review which prominent <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent> 
and corporations were involved, what aid and comfort they gave our 
nation's enemies - treasonable offenses during time of war, and 
investigations into these matters which produced evidence of a 
<ent type='GPE'>US</ent>/<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> corporate conspiracy to bring a fascist state to <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, 
and eliminate competition in the industrial raw materials market in 
order to force world-wide dependance on oil-based petrochemicals. </p>

<p> WILLIAM RANDOLPH <ent type='ORG'>HEARST</ent> </p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent>, who was so concerned about the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n public's health and 
safety on the matter of marijuana use, apparently had no such fears 
when it came to Hitler and the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>. According to journalist George 
Seldes:</p>

<p> ". . . Hitler had the support of the most widely circulated 
magazine in history, '<ent type='ORG'>Readers Digest</ent>,' as well as nineteen big-city 
newspapers and one of the three great <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n news agencies, the 
$220-million <ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent> press empire. </p>

<p> ". . . William Randolph <ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent>, Sr., . . . was the lord of all the 
press lords in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>. The millions who read the <ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent> 
newspapers and magazines and saw <ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent> newsreels in the nation's 
moviehouses had their minds poisoned by Hitler propaganda. </p>

<p> "It was . . . disclosed first to President Roosevelt [by Ambassador 
Dodd] almost on the day it happened, in September 1934, and it is 
detailed in the book 'Ambassador Dodd's Diary,' published in 1941, 
and again in libel-proof documents on file in the courts of the 
state of <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>. William E. Dodd, professor of history [at the 
University of <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>], told me about the <ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent> sell-out . . . </p>

<p> "According to Ambassador Dodd, <ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent> came to take the waters at 
<ent type='ORG'>Bad Nauheim</ent> in September 1934, and Dodd somehow learned immediately 
that Hitler had sent two of his most trusted <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> propagandists, 
<ent type='ORG'>Hanfstangel</ent> and Rosenberg, to ask <ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent> how <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>m could present a 
better image in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>. When <ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent> went to <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent> later 
in the month, he was taken to see Hitler." </p>

<p> Seldes reports that a $400000 a year deal was struck between 
<ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent> and Hitler, and signed by Doctor Joseph Goebbels, the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> 
propaganda minister. "<ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent>," continues Seldes, "completely changed 
the editorial policy of his nineteen daily newspapers the same month 
he got the money." </p>

<p> In the court documents filed on behalf of Dan Gillmor, publisher of 
a magazine named "Friday," in response to a lawsuit by <ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent>, under 
item 61, he states: "Promptly after this said visit with Adolf 
Hitler and the making of said arrangements. . . said plaintiff, 
William Randolph <ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent>, instructed all <ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent> press correspondents 
in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>, including those of <ent type='ORG'>INS</ent> [<ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent>'s International News 
Service] to report happenings in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> only in a friendly' manner. 
All of such correspondents reporting happenings in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> 
accurately and without friendliness, sympathy and bias for the 
actions of the then <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> government, were transferred elsewhere, 
discharged, or forced to resign. . . ." </p>

<p> In the late 1930s, Seldes recounts, when "several sedition 
indictments [were brought by] <ent type='ORG'>the Department of Justice</ent> . . . 
against a score or two of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent>, the defendants included an 
unusually large minority of newspaper men and women, most of them 
<ent type='ORG'>Hearst</ent> employees." (2) </p>

<p> ANDREW <ent type='ORG'>MELLON</ent> </p>

<p> "Thurman Arnold, as assistant district attorney of the United 
<ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s, his assistant, Norman Littell, and several <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>ional 
investigations, have produced incontrovertible evidence that some of 
our biggest monopolies entered into secret agreements with the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> 
cartels and divided the world up among them," states Seldes in his 
book, "Facts and Fascism," published in 1943. "Most notorious of all 
was <ent type='ORG'>Alcoa</ent>, the Mellon-Davis-Duke monopoly which is largely 
responsible for the fact <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> did not have the aluminum with 
which to build airplanes before and after Pearl Harbor, while 
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> had an unlimited supply." (3)</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Alcoa</ent> sabotage of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n war production had already cost the U.S. 
"10000 fighters or 1665 bombers," according to <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>man Pierce 
of <ent type='GPE'>Oregon</ent> speaking in May 1941, because of "the effort to protect 
<ent type='ORG'>Alcoa</ent>'s monopolistic position. . ." </p>

<p> "If <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> loses this war," said Secretary of the <ent type='ORG'>Interior</ent> 
[Harold] Ickes, June 26, 1941, "it can thank the Aluminum 
Corporation of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>." </p>

<p> "By its cartel agreement with I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>, controlled by Hitler," 
writes Seldes, "<ent type='ORG'>Alcoa</ent> sabotaged the aluminum program of the U.S. air 
force. <ent type='ORG'>The <ent type='ORG'>Truman Committee</ent></ent> [on <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>al Defense, chaired by then-
Senator Harry S. Truman in 1942] heard testimony that <ent type='ORG'>Alcoa</ent>'s 
representative, A.H. Bunker, $1-a-year head of the aluminum section 
of O.P.M., prevented work on our $600000000 aluminum expansion 
program." (4) </p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>DU PONT</ent> AND GENERAL MOTORS </p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>General Motors</ent> is included here because, by 1929, the <ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent> 
corporation had acquired controlling interest in, and had 
interlocking directorships with, <ent type='ORG'>General Motors</ent>. </p>

<p> Irenee <ent type='ORG'>du Pont</ent>, "the most imposing and powerful member of the 
clan," according to biographer and historian Charles Higham, "was 
obsessed with Hitler's principles." "He keenly followed the career 
of the future Fuhrer in the 1920s, and on September 7, 1926, in a 
speech to the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Chemical Society, he advocated a race of 
supermen, to be achieved by injecting special drugs into them in 
boyhood to make their characters to order." Higham's book on this 
subject, "Trading with the Enemy: An Expose of the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>-<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
Money Plot 1933-1949," is highly recommended. </p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent>'s anti-Semitism "matched that of Hitler" and, in 1933, the 
<ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent>s "began financing native fascist groups in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> . . ." 
one of which Higham identifies as the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Liberty League: "a 
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> organization whipping up hatred of blacks and <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent>," and the 
"love of Hitler. </p>

<p> "Financed . . . to the tune of $500000 the first year, the Liberty 
League had a lavish thirty-one-room office in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>, branches in 
twenty-six colleges, and fifteen subsidiary organizations nationwide 
that distributed fifty million copies of its <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> pamphlets. . . . </p>

<p> "The <ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent>s' fascistic behavior was seen in 1936, when Irenee du 
Pont used <ent type='ORG'>General Motors</ent> money to finance the notorious Black 
Legion. This terrorist organization had as its purpose the 
prevention of automobile workers from unionizing. The members wore 
hoods and black robes, with skulls and crossbones. They fire-bombed 
union meetings, murdered union organizers, often by beating them to 
death, and dedicated their lives to destroying <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>communist</ent>s. 
They linked to the Ku Klux Klan. . . . It was brought out that at 
least fifty people, many of them blacks, had been butchered by the 
Legion." (5)</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent> support of Hitler extended into the very heart of the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> 
war machine as well, according to Higham, and several other 
researchers: "<ent type='ORG'>General Motors</ent>, under the control of the <ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent> 
family of <ent type='GPE'>Delaware</ent>, played a part in collaboration" with the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>. </p>

<p> "Between 1932 and 1939, bosses of <ent type='ORG'>General Motors</ent> poured $30 million 
into I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> plants . . ." Further, Higham informs us that by 
"the mid-1930s, <ent type='ORG'>General Motors</ent> was committed to full-scale 
production of trucks, armored cars, and tanks in <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>." (6) </p>

<p> Researchers Morton Mintz and Jerry S. Cohen, in their book, "Power 
Inc.," describe the <ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>GM</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> relationship in these terms:</p>

<p> ". . . In 1929, [<ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent>-controlled] <ent type='ORG'>GM</ent> acquired the largest 
automobile company in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>, Adam <ent type='ORG'>Opel</ent>, A.G. This predestined the 
subsidiary to become important to the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> war effort. In a heavily 
documented study presented to the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> Subcommittee on Antitrust 
and Monopoly in February 1974, <ent type='GPE'>Bradford</ent> C. <ent type='ORG'>Snell</ent>, an assistant 
subcommittee counsel, wrote: </p>

<p> "'<ent type='ORG'>GM</ent>'s participation in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>'s preparation for war began in 
1935. That year its <ent type='ORG'>Opel</ent> subsidiary cooperated with the Reich in 
locating a new heavy truck facility at Brandenburg, which military 
officials advised would be less vulnerable to enemy air attacks. 
During the succeeding years, <ent type='ORG'>GM</ent> supplied the <ent type='ORG'>Wehrmact</ent> with <ent type='ORG'>Opel</ent> 
"Blitz" trucks from the Brandenburg complex. For these and other 
contributions to [the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>] wartime preparations, <ent type='ORG'>GM</ent>'s chief 
executive for overseas operations [James Mooney] was awarded the 
Order of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> Eagle (first class) by Adolf Hitler.'"</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>GM</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> collaboration, according to <ent type='ORG'>Snell</ent>, included the 
participation of <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent></ent> [now <ent type='ORG'>Exxon</ent>] in one, very 
important arrangement. <ent type='ORG'>GM</ent> and <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent></ent> formed a 
joint subsidiary with the giant <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> chemical cartel, I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>, 
named <ent type='ORG'>Ethyl</ent> G.m.b.H. [now <ent type='ORG'>Ethyl</ent>, Inc.] which, according to <ent type='ORG'>Snell</ent>: 
"provided the mechanized <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> armies with synthetic tetraethyl 
fuel [leaded gas]. During 1936-39, at the urgent request of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> 
officials who realized that <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>'s scarce petroleum reserves 
would not satisfy war demands, <ent type='ORG'>GM</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Exxon</ent> joined with <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> 
chemical interests in the erection of the lead-tetraethyl plants. 
According to captured <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> records, these facilities contributed 
substantially to the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> war effort: 'The fact that since the 
beginning of the war we could produce lead-tetraethyl is entirely 
due to the circumstances that, shortly before, the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent> [Du 
Pont, <ent type='ORG'>GM</ent> and <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent>] had presented us with the production 
plants complete with experimental knowledge. Without lead-tetraethyl 
the present method of warfare would be unthinkable.'" (7) </p>

<p> At about the same time the <ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent>s were serving the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> cause in 
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>, they were involved in a <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> plot to overthrow the 
<ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent> government. </p>

<p> "Along with friends of <ent type='ORG'>the Morgan Bank</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>General Motors</ent>," in 
early 1934, writes Higham, "certain <ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent> backers financed a coup 
d'etat that would overthrow the President with the aid of a $3 
million-funded army of terrorists . . ." The object was to force 
Roosevelt "to take orders from businessmen as part of a fascist 
government or face the alternative of imprisonment and execution . . 
." </p>

<p> Higham reports that "<ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent> men allegedly held an urgent series of 
meetings with the <ent type='ORG'>Morgans</ent>," to choose who would lead this "bizarre 
conspiracy." "They finally settled on one of the most popular 
soldiers in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, General Smedly Butler of <ent type='GPE'>Pennsylvania</ent>." Butler 
was approached by "fascist attorney" Gerald MacGuire (an official of 
the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Legion), who attempted to recruit Butler into the role 
of an <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Hitler. </p>

<p> "Butler was horrified," but played along with MacGuire until, a 
short time later, he notified <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>White</ent> <ent type='ORG'>House</ent></ent> of the plot. Roosevelt 
considered having "the leaders of the houses of <ent type='ORG'>Morgan and</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent>" 
arrested, but feared that "it would create an unthinkable national 
crisis in the midst of a depression and perhaps another Wall Street 
crash." Roosevelt decided the best way to defuse the plot was to 
expose it, and leaked the story to the press. </p>

<p> "The newspapers ran the story of the attempted coup on the front 
page, but generally ridiculed it as absurd and preposterous." But an 
investigation by the <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>ional Committee on Un-<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
Activities - 74th <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, first session, <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> of Representatives, 
Investigation of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> and other propaganda - was begun later that 
same year. </p>

<p> "It was four years," continues Higham, "before the committee dared 
to publish its report in a white paper that was marked for 
'restricted circulation.' They were forced to admit that 'certain 
persons made an attempt to establish a fascist organization in this 
country . . . [The] committee was able to verify all the pertinent 
statements made by General Butler.' This admission that the entire 
plan was deadly in intent was not accompanied by the imprisonment of 
anybody. Further investigations disclosed that over a million people 
had been guaranteed to join the scheme and that the arms and 
munitions necessary would have been supplied by <ent type='ORG'>Remington</ent>, a <ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent> 
subsidiary." (8)</p>

<p> The names of important individuals and groups involved in the 
conspiracy were suppressed by the committee, but later revealed by 
Seldes, Philadelphia Record reporter Paul <ent type='NORP'>French</ent>, and Jules Archer, 
author of the book, "The Plot to Seize <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>White</ent> <ent type='ORG'>House</ent></ent>." Included 
were John W. Davis (attorney for the J.P. Morgan banking group), 
Robert Sterling Clark (Wall Street broker and heir to the Singer 
sewing machine fortune), William Doyle (<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Legion official), 
and the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Liberty League (backed by executives from J.P. 
<ent type='ORG'>Morgan and</ent> Co., <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> interests, E.F. Hutton, and <ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent>-
controlled <ent type='ORG'>General Motors</ent>). (9) </p>

<p> THE <ent type='GPE'>US</ent>/<ent type='NORP'>NAZI</ent> <ent type='GPE'>CA</ent>RTEL AGREEMENT </p>

<p> "On November 23, 1937," states Higham, "representatives of General 
Motors held a secret meeting in <ent type='GPE'>Boston</ent> with Baron Manfred von 
Killinger, who was . . . in charge of <ent type='ORG'>West</ent> Coast espionage [for the 
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>], and Baron von Tipplekirsch, <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> consul general and <ent type='ORG'>Gestapo</ent> 
leader in <ent type='GPE'>Boston</ent>. This group signed a joint agreement showing total 
commitment to the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> cause for the indefinite future. . . ." (10) </p>

<p> Seldes describes the plotters as "the great owners and rulers of 
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent> who planned world domination through political and military 
Fascism" including "several leading <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n industrialists, members 
of the <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>, and representatives of large 
business and political organizations . . ." </p>

<p> He obtained the text of the agreement, and published it in his 
newsletter, "In Fact," on July 13, 1942. The plan "goes much further 
than the mere cartel conspiracies of <ent type='ORG'>Big Business</ent> of both 
countries," writes Seldes, "because it has political clauses and 
points to a bigger conspiracy of money and politicians such as 
helped betray <ent type='GPE'>Norway</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> and other lands to the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> machine. 
The most powerful fortress in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> is the production monopolies, 
but its betrayal would involve, as it did in <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>, the 
participation of some of the most powerful figures of the political 
as well as the industrial world." (11) </p>

<p> STANDARD OIL OF <ent type='GPE'>NEW JERSEY</ent> (Now <ent type='ORG'>Exxon</ent>) </p>

<p> "On February 27, 1942," according to Higham, "Arnold, with 
documents stuffed under his arms, . . . strode into the lion's den 
of <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> at 30 <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Plaza. Just behind him were Secretary 
of the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> Franklin Knox and Secretary of the <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> Henry L. 
<ent type='ORG'>Stimson</ent>." They confronted <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> official William <ent type='ORG'>Farish</ent> and 
"Arnold sharply laid down his charges" that "by continuing to favor 
Hitler in rubber deal and patent arrangements," <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent> "had 
acted against the interests of the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n government . . . 
suggested a fine of $1.5 million and a consent decree whereby 
<ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> would turn over for the duration all the patents" in 
question. </p>

<p> "<ent type='ORG'>Farish</ent> rejected the proposal on the spot. He pointed out that 
<ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent>" was also selling the U.S. a "high percentage" of the fuel 
being used by the <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent>, and <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent> "making it possible for 
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent> to win the war. Where would <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> be without it?"</p>

<p> Blackmail? Yes, says Higham. And effective. Arnold was finally 
reduced to asking the oil company official "to what <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent> 
would agree. After all, there had to be at least token punishment. . 
. . Arnold, <ent type='ORG'>Stimson</ent>, and Knox soon realized they had no power to 
compare with that of <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent>." </p>

<p> The price <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent> "agreed" to pay for its crime? A modest fine 
of a few thousand dollars divided up among ten defendants. "<ent type='ORG'>Farish</ent> 
paid $1000, or a quarter of one week's salary, for having betrayed 
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>." </p>

<p> In <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent>, charges of "criminal conspiracy with the enemy" were 
filed against <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent>, then "dropped in return for <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> 
releasing its patents and paying the modest fine." But Arnold, and 
his ally, Secretary of the <ent type='ORG'>Interior</ent> Harold Ickes, weren't finished 
with <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent> just yet. They approached Senator Truman, chairman 
of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> Special Committee Investigating</ent> the <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>al Defense 
Program. "With great enthusiasm Give 'em Hell Harry embarked on a 
series of hearings in March 1942, in order to disclose the truth 
about <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent>." </p>

<p> Between the 26th and the 28th of March, 1942, Arnold "produced 
documents showing that <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> had literally 
carved up the world markets, with oil and chemical monopolies all 
over the map," according to Higham. (12) </p>

<p> Mintz and Cohen describe the confrontation:</p>

<p> "Four months after <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent> entered World War II, the 
<ent type='ORG'>Justice Department</ent> obtained an indictment of <ent type='ORG'>Exxon</ent> and its principal 
officers for having made arrangements, starting in the late 1920s 
with I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> involving patent sharing and division of world 
markets. Jersey <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> agreed not to develop processes for the 
manufacture of synthetic rubber; in exchange, <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> agreed not to 
compete in the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n petroleum market. After war broke out in 
<ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>, but before the attack on Pearl Harbor, executives of 
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>, at a meeting in <ent type='GPE'>Holland</ent>, established a 
'modus <ent type='ORG'>vivendi</ent>' for continuing the arrangements in event of war 
between <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent> and <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> - although the arrangements 
interfered with the ability of <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent> to make synthetic 
rubber desperately needed after it entered the war in December 1941. 
Rather than face a criminal trial, <ent type='ORG'>Exxon</ent> and the indicted executives 
entered no-contest pleas - the legal equivalent of guilty pleas - 
and were fined the minor sums which were the maximum amounts 
permitted by law. A few days later, on March 26, 1942, the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> 
Special Committee Investigating the <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>al Defense Program held a 
hearing at which Thurman Arnold, chief of the <ent type='ORG'>Antitrust Division</ent>, 
put into the record documents on which the [criminal] indictment had 
been based, including a memo from a <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent> official on the 
'modus <ent type='ORG'>vivendi</ent>' agreed to in <ent type='GPE'>Holland</ent>. After the hearing, the 
committee chairman, Harry S. Truman, characterized the arrangements 
as treasonable." (13)</p>

<p> Another source book on this subject of <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> / <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> corporate 
activities is "The Secret War Against the <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent>," by Mark Aarons and 
John <ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent>. Here is their version of the events:</p>

<p> "Before the war <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent> had forged a synthetic oil 
and rubber cartel with the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>-controlled I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>," which 
"worked well until <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent> joined the war in 1941. . . . 
Next to the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s, I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> owned the largest share of 
stock in <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent></ent>. Among other things, <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> 
had provided <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> with its synthetic rubber patents and technical 
knowledge, while <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> had kept its patents to itself, under strict 
instructions from the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> government."</p>

<p> Evidence which Thurman Arnold turned over to the <ent type='ORG'>Truman Committee</ent>, 
which Truman would declare "treasonous," included "<ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent>'s 1939 
letter renewing its agreement, which made it clear that the 
<ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s' company was prepared to work with the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> whether 
their own government was at war with <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Third Reich</ent></ent> or not. 
Truman's <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> Committee</ent> on the <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>al Defense was outraged and 
began to probe into the whole scandalous arrangement, much to the 
discomfort of John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, Jr. Suddenly, however, the whole 
matter was dropped. </p>

<p> "There was a reason for <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s escape: blackmail. According 
to the former intelligence officers we interviewed on this point, 
the blackmail was simple and powerful: The <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> brothers [John 
<ent type='ORG'>Foster</ent>, later Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>, and Allen, later director of the 
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>] had one of their clients threaten to interrupt the U.S. oil 
supply during wartime." </p>

<p> When confronted by Arnold on the <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> - <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> arrangement 
"<ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> executives made it clear that the entire U.S. war effort 
was fueled by their oil and it could be stopped. . . . The <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
government had no choice but to go along if it wanted to win the 
war." (14) </p>

<p> July 13, 1944, Ralph W. Gallagher, attorney for <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent>, filed 
a lawsuit against the U.S. government's seizure of the contested 
patents. "On November 7, 1945, Judge Charles E. Wyzanski gave his 
verdict," according to Higham. "He decided that the government had 
been entitled to seize the patents. Gallagher appealed. On September 
22, 1947, Judge Charles Clark delivered the final word on the 
subject. He said, '<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent> can be considered an enemy national 
in view of its relationships with I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> after the United 
<ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s and <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> had become active enemies.' The appeal was 
denied." (15) </p>

<p> One aspect of this <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> - I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> relationship, revealed in 
testimony during the <ent type='ORG'>Patents Committee</ent> hearings, chaired by Senator 
Homer T. Bone in May 1942, is of interest to those who seek direct 
evidence of a conspiracy by big oil companies to suppress 
development of synthetic substitutes to petrochemical products such 
as industrial chemicals, aircraft lubricants and fuel, all of which 
can be made from hemp: </p>

<p> "On May 6th, John R. <ent type='ORG'>Jacobs</ent>, Jr., of the Attorney General's 
department, testified that <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> had interfered with the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
explosives industry by blocking the use of a method of producing 
synthetic ammonia. As a result of its deals with <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>, the United 
<ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s had been unable to get the use of this vital process even 
after Pearl Harbor. Also, <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent> had been restricted in 
techniques of producing hydrogen from natural gas and from obtaining 
paraflow, a product used for airplane lubrication at high altitudes. 
. . ." </p>

<p> On August 7th, "<ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> oil operator C.R. Starnes appeared to testify 
that <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> had blocked him at every turn in his efforts to 
produce synthetic rubber after Pearl Harbor. . . ." </p>

<p> On August 12th, "John R. <ent type='ORG'>Jacobs</ent> reappeared in an <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> private's 
uniform (he had been inducted the day before) to bring up another 
disagreeable matter: <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> had also, in league with <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>, 
restricted production of methanol, a wood alcohol that was sometimes 
used as motor fuel." (16) </p>

<p> The restriction against methanol production apparently did not 
apply to the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>, however. "As late as April 1943," Higham 
reveals, "<ent type='ORG'>General Motors</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Stockholm</ent> [<ent type='GPE'>Sweden</ent>] was reported as 
trading with the enemy. . . . Further documents show that, as with 
<ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent>, repairs on <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> army trucks and conversion from gasoline to 
wood-gasoline production were being handled by <ent type='ORG'>GM</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Switzerland</ent>." 
(17) </p>

<p> The use of hemp as a source of methanol was known to the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>, 
revealed in the pamphlet "The Humorous Hemp Primer," published in 
<ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>, also in 1943. This document, recently re-published in the 
1995 edition of "Hemp and the <ent type='ORG'>Marijuana</ent> Conspiracy: The Emperor 
Wears No Clothes," by veteran hemp conspiracy researcher Jack Herer, 
states that:</p>

<p> "<ent type='ORG'>Crops</ent> should not only provide food in large quantities, they can 
provide raw materials for industry. . . . Among such raw materials 
of especially high value is hemp . . . </p>

<p> "The woody part of this large plant is not to be thrown out, since 
it can easily be used for surface coatings for the finest floors. It 
also provides paper and cardboard, building materials and wall 
paneling. Further processing will even produce wood sugar and wood 
gas. . . .</p>

<p> "Anyone who grows hemp today need not fear a lack of a market, 
because hemp, as useful as it is, will be purchased in unlimited 
amounts." (18) </p>

<p> The <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> obviously considered hemp a vital war material that could 
be used to produce methanol, or "wood gas," at the same time, in 
1943, that <ent type='ORG'>Du Pont</ent>-controlled <ent type='ORG'>General Motors</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Switzerland</ent> was 
"converting from gasoline to wood-gasoline production." This, taken 
into consideration along with the earlier statement that <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> 
Oil-I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> had "restricted production of methanol" and the <ent type='ORG'>GM</ent>-
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent>-I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> joint venture, <ent type='ORG'>Ethyl</ent>, Inc., whose 
profitability depended on the production of lead-tetraethyl for oil-
based petrochemical gasoline - in direct competition with the 
alternative methanol, or "wood gas," certainly opens new avenues of 
investigation into the existence of a conspiracy against hemp as an 
alternative, and competing, industrial raw material, by these very 
same corporations which sold <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> out to the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> for profit and 
control of world resources and markets. </p>

<p> "Just after Pearl Harbor," writes Seldes, "the Assistant Attorney 
General, Mr. Thurman Arnold, issued a sensational report of the 
sabotage of the national [war production] program, the first report 
naming the practices which were later to be referred to as the 
treason of big business in wartime. Said Mr. Arnold:</p>

<p> "Looking back over 10 months of defense effort we can now see how 
much it has been hampered by the attitude of powerful basic 
industries who have feared to expand their production because 
expansion would endanger their future control of industry. </p>

<p> "Anti-trust investigations during the past year have shown that 
there is not an organized basic industry in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent> which 
has not been restricting production by some device or other in order 
to avoid what they call 'ruinous overproduction after the war'." 
(19)</p>

<p> By "ruinous overproduction," of course, they meant free-market 
competition. So, to question the existence of an industrial 
conspiracy against competition, during the 1930s and 1940s, is 
pointless. It has long been totally documented by volumes of 
evidence, available in the public record. And among this list of 
convicted corporate conspirators are murderers, racists, pro-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> 
collaborators, blackmailers and <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>s who plotted at 
least one armed take-over of the U.S. government. And the list is 
not yet complete. </p>

<p> THE <ent type='ORG'>FORD</ent> MOTOR COMPA<ent type='GPE'>NY</ent> </p>

<p> Henry <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent>, writes Higham, "admired Hitler from the beginning, when 
the future Fuhrer was a struggling and obscure fanatic. He shared 
with Hitler a fanatical hatred of <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent>." </p>

<p> "<ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent>'s book 'The International Jew' was issued in 1927. A virulent 
anti-<ent type='NORP'>Semitic</ent> tract, it was still being distributed in Latin <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> 
and the <ent type='NORP'>Arab</ent> countries as late as 1945. Hitler admired the book and 
it influenced him deeply. Visitors to Hitler's headquarters at the 
Brown <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Munich</ent> noticed a large photograph of Henry <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent> 
hanging in his office. Stacked high on the table outside were copies 
of <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent>'s book. As early as 1923," when Hitler heard that <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent> was 
planning to run for President, he "told an interviewer from the 
'<ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>-Tribune,' 'I wish that I could send some of my shock troops 
to <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> and other big <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n cities to help'." </p>

<p> As late as 1940, <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent> Motor Company "refused to build aircraft 
engines for <ent type='GPE'>England</ent> and instead built supplies of the 5-ton military 
trucks that were the backbone of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> army transportation." (20) </p>

<p> The <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent> Motor Company was also aware of the potential of hemp as 
an alternative industrial resource, devoting many years research to 
the subject. </p>

<p> In a 1989 <ent type='ORG'>ABC Radio</ent> broadcast, Hugh Downs reported that in the 
1930s, "the <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent> Motor Company also saw a future in biomass fuels. 
<ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent> operated a successful biomass conversion plant that included 
hemp at their <ent type='LOC'>Iron Mountain</ent> facility in <ent type='GPE'>Michigan</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent> engineers 
extracted methanol, charcoal fuel, tar, pitch, ethyl acetate, and 
creosote - all fundamental ingredients for modern industry, and now 
supplied by oil-related industries. . . . Henry <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent>'s experiments 
with methanol promised cheap, readily-available fuel." (21) </p>

<p> As reported in "<ent type='ORG'>Popular Mechanics</ent>" in December, 1941, <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent>'s 
research represented "an industrial revolution in progress . . . a 
revolution in materials that will affect every home." (22) </p>

<p> So, it is possible, even likely, that <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>General Motors</ent> 
conversion "from gasoline to wood-gasoline production" for <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> 
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>, as earlier reported by Higham, involved at least some 
consideration of hemp as a resource, if not actual production of 
"wood-gas" from hemp. After all, <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent> had already committed several 
years and significant research dollars to the subject. </p>

<p> The implication of methanol fuel patents, hemp industry research 
and production facilities, all in the hands of this cabal of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>-
allied <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n corporations, during a proven period of anti-
competition conspiracies, and wartime blackmail against the U.S. 
government, should provide additional support for the hemp 
conspiracy theories. The fact is that <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> recognized hemp 
as a vital war material - one which, just before <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s entrance 
into World War II, was positioned to compete in the free-market 
against the products controlled by the Pro-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
corporations. Unrestricted expansion of <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent> industrial 
hemp production threatened not only the profits of these treasonous 
corporations, but the degree of their control over <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s 
production of vital war materials. </p>

<p> This view of hemp, not as a "dangerous drug" but as a vital war 
material, was acknowledged by <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='GPE'>Kentucky</ent> Legislature</ent> a little over 
100 years before the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese</ent> sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1841, 
according to Professor James F. <ent type='ORG'>Hopkins</ent>, author of "A History of the 
Hemp Industry in <ent type='GPE'>Kentucky</ent>," published by the University of <ent type='GPE'>Kentucky</ent> 
Press in 1951: </p>

<p> "When the farmers of <ent type='GPE'>Woodford County</ent> [KY] assembled in October, 
1841, to consider a program of hemp production for the <ent type='ORG'>navy</ent>, they 
only went as far as to express an opinion that the government should 
employ a rope spinner in <ent type='GPE'>Kentucky</ent> for the purpose of converting the 
fiber into yarns, which could be transported much more cheaply and 
safely than the bulky raw material. <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>The Committee</ent> on Agriculture of</ent> 
the <ent type='GPE'>Kentucky</ent> <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> of Representatives inquired into the matter early 
in 1842 . . . </p>

<p> "Both houses of <ent type='ORG'>the General Assembly</ent> sent to the Senators and 
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>men from <ent type='GPE'>Kentucky</ent> a request that they use their 'best 
exertions' to have established in the state one or more agencies for 
the inspection and manufacture of hemp for the <ent type='ORG'>navy</ent>. A select 
committee of <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, appointed to consider the resolutions from 
<ent type='GPE'>Kentucky</ent>, reported three resolutions of its own: that the <ent type='ORG'>navy</ent> be 
directed to construct a factory at <ent type='GPE'>Louisville</ent> 'for the purpose of 
depositing and manufacturing . . . such hempen fabrics of domestic 
water-rotted hemp as the public service may require'; that 
inspectors be appointed to test the fiber that might be offered for 
sale; and that, after due notice to the public, purchase of the 
necessary amount of fiber be made at the factory. <ent type='ORG'>The Committee</ent> 
contended that its plan would build up during peacetime a source of 
hemp which would be vitally important in case of war, encourage 
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n agriculture and manufactures, and decrease the unfavorable 
balance of trade." (23) </p>

<p> [NOTE: For many years we <ent type='NORP'>Kentuckians</ent> have had a good deal of our 
heritage and history buried beneath a thick layer of propaganda from 
a source of power and control in this country which knows neither 
honor nor justice. Now, we are learning the truth. Our history as a 
state built upon the foundation of a long- and dishonestly- outlawed 
industry endures.] </p>

<p> INTERNATIONAL TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH </p>

<p> Even after Pearl Harbor, <ent type='ORG'>ITT</ent> was working for the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>, reports 
Higham: ". . . the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> army, <ent type='ORG'>navy</ent>, and air force contracted with 
<ent type='ORG'>ITT</ent> for the manufacture of switchboards, telephones, alarm gongs, 
buoys, air raid warning devices, radar equipment, and thirty 
thousand fuses per month for artillery shells used to kill <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> 
and <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n troops." </p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>ITT</ent> also "supplied ingredients for the rocket bombs that fell on 
<ent type='GPE'>London</ent>," and other devices as well, without which "it would have 
been impossible for the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> air force to kill <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n and 
<ent type='NORP'>British</ent> troops, for the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> army to fight the <ent type='ORG'>Allies</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Africa</ent>, 
<ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>, for <ent type='GPE'>England</ent> to have been bombed, or for 
<ent type='ORG'>Allied</ent> ships to have been attacked at sea." (24) </p>

<p> In 1938, "following a series of meetings with <ent type='ORG'>Luftwaffe</ent> chief 
Herman Goring, [<ent type='ORG'>ITT</ent> founder and chairman Sosthenes] Behn encouraged 
<ent type='ORG'>ITT</ent>'s Lorenz subsidiary to purchase 28 percent of the Focke-Wulf 
firm, manufacturer of the bombers that were to sink so many <ent type='ORG'>Allied</ent> 
ships during the war," according to researcher and author Jim 
Hougan. (25) </p>

<p> Anthony Sampson, in "The Sovereign <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>ITT</ent>," reports on what 
is perhaps the most bizarre aspect of the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent>/<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> corporate 
partnership, war reparations:</p>

<p> ". . . <ent type='ORG'>ITT</ent> now presents itself as the innocent victim of the Second 
World War, and has been handsomely recompensed for its injuries. In 
1967, nearly thirty years after the events, <ent type='ORG'>ITT</ent> actually managed to 
obtain $27 million in compensation from the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n government, for 
war damage to Focke-Wulf plants - on the basis that they were 
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n property bombed by <ent type='ORG'>Allied</ent> bombers." (26)</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission</ent> was responsible for this 
payment to <ent type='ORG'>ITT</ent>, and other U.S. corporations as well. </p>

<p> <ent type='GPE'>Bradford</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Snell</ent> reports that "After the cessation of hostilities, <ent type='ORG'>GM</ent> 
and <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent> demanded reparations from the U.S. Government for wartime 
damages sustained by their Axis facilities as a result of <ent type='ORG'>Allied</ent> 
bombing. By 1967 <ent type='ORG'>GM</ent> had collected more than $33 million in 
reparations and Federal tax benefits for damages to its warplane and 
motor vehicle properties in formerly Axis territories . . . <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent> 
received a little less than $1 million, primarily as a result of 
damages sustained by its military truck complex at <ent type='GPE'>Cologne</ent>." (27) </p>

<p> ALLEN DULLES: ARCHITECT OF THE <ent type='GPE'>US</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>NAZI</ent> NETWORK </p>

<p> Contemporary history records Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> as one of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s top 
spymasters, from his early days in <ent type='ORG'>the Office of Strategic Services</ent> 
(<ent type='ORG'>O<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent></ent>) in World War II, to his position as Director of the <ent type='ORG'>Central</ent> 
Intelligence Agency (<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>) in the 1950s and early 1960s (until 
President John F. Kennedy fired him over <ent type='ORG'>the Bay of Pigs</ent> disaster in 
1961), and finally to his membership on the controversial Warren 
Commission, which investigated President Kennedy's assassination. 
Until recently, his pivotal role in promoting a U.S. corporate 
relationship with the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> was little known. <ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent> and Aarons 
describe the post-World War I role of Allen, and his brother, John 
<ent type='ORG'>Foster</ent>, in the following terms:</p>

<p> "We first turn to <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s creation of international finance 
networks for the benefit of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>. In the beginning, moving 
money into <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Third Reich</ent></ent> was quite legal. Lawyers saw to that. And 
Allen and his brother John <ent type='ORG'>Foster</ent> were not just any lawyers. They 
were international finance specialists for the powerful Wall Street 
law firm of Sullivan &amp; <ent type='ORG'>Cromwell</ent>. . . . </p>

<p> "The <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> brothers were the ones who convinced <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
businessmen to avoid U.S. government regulation by investing in 
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>. It began with the Versailles Treaty, in which they played 
no small role. After World War I the defeated <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> government 
promised to pay war reparations to the <ent type='ORG'>Allies</ent> in gold, but <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> 
had no gold. It had to borrow the gold from Sullivan &amp; <ent type='ORG'>Cromwell</ent>'s 
clients in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>. Nearly 70 percent of the money that 
flowed into <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> during the 1930s came from investors in the 
<ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent>, many of them Sullivan &amp; <ent type='ORG'>Cromwell</ent> clients. . . </p>

<p> "<ent type='ORG'>Foster</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>, as a member of the board of I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>, seems to 
have had little difficulty in getting along with whoever was in 
charge. Some of our sources insist that both <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> brothers made 
substantial but indirect contributions to the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> party as the 
price of continued influence inside the new <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> order. . . ."

<p> THE NEW WORLD (<ent type='ORG'>DIS</ent>)ORDER </p>

<p> "The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if 
the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it 
becomes stronger than their democratic state itself. That, in 
essence, is fascism - ownership of government by an individual, by a 
group, or by any other controlling power. </p>

<p> "Among us today a concentration of private power without equal in 
history is growing." - President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1) </p>

<p> As mentioned earlier, the secret U.S./<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> corporate alliance 
during World War II was the result of substantial <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
investment in post-World War I <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>. In order to protect these 
investments, and the accumulating profits, the U.S. multinational 
corporations remained an important part of the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> war machine 
until the final defeat of <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> in 1945. What effect did the end 
of World War II have on this faction of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> collaborators? </p>

<p> In this section we will review the evidence, much of it from 
recently de-classified documents, that this pro-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> faction, rather 
than facing charges of high treason, became an integral part of the 
<ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent> national security apparatus, extending its fascist 
influence in both foreign and domestic policies and, in effect, 
creating what has been referred to as <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s "Invisible 
Government." The excuse, of course, was Communism. </p>

<p> THE BUGGING OF WALL STREET </p>

<p> Aarons and <ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent>' research, which documents the <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> brothers' 
pro-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> activities, did not go unnoticed. "Before his death, former 
<ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent> Justice Arthur Goldberg granted one of the authors an 
interview. Justice Goldberg had served in U.S. intelligence during 
World War II. Although he said little in public, he had collected 
information on the <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> boys' activities over the years. His 
verdict was blunt. 'The <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> brothers were traitors.' They had 
betrayed their country, by giving aid and comfort to the enemy in 
time of war." (2) </p>

<p> Much of what is now known about the activities of the <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> 
brothers and other <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> collaborators in banking and 
industry came as a result of a top-secret joint U.S.-<ent type='NORP'>British</ent> 
intelligence program known as <ent type='ORG'>the Ultra Project</ent>. "Prior to the 
<ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent>' entry into the war," write <ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent> and Aarons, 
"Roosevelt permitted <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> intelligence to wiretap <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
targets.</p>

<p> "According to our sources in the intelligence community, the area 
of coverage included a good bit of the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> financial district, 
several floors of <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Plaza, part of the R<ent type='GPE'>CA</ent> Building, two 
prominent clubs, and various shipping firms. . . . </p>

<p> "The wiretap unit reported to Sir William Stephenson, a <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> 
electronics genius better known by his code name, '<ent type='ORG'>Intrepid</ent>.' From 
his headquarters in the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> building, Stephenson's job was 
to identify U.S. companies that were aiding the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>." (3) </p>

<p> "Several months before <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent> declared war," continue 
<ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent> and Aarons, "Bill Donovan invited Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> to head up the 
<ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> branch of the Office of the Coordinator of Information 
(COI), President Roosevelt's new intelligence agency and the 
precursor to <ent type='ORG'>the Office of Strategic Services</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>O<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent></ent>). Its primary 
mission was to collect information against the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> and their 
collaborators. In other words, <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> was asked to inform on his own 
clients in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>. . . ." </p>

<p> "Roosevelt had approved his selection as head of the COI <ent type='GPE'>Manhattan</ent> 
branch because he wanted <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> where the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> wiretappers could 
keep an eye on him. . . . </p>

<p> "One floor below <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> was Stephenson's wiretap shop. Inside 
<ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s operation was one of Roosevelt's spies, Arthur Goldberg . . 
." who, "confirmed . . . that <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s appointment was a setup. . . 
. </p>

<p> "Roosevelt was giving <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> enough rope to hang himself. From 
Stephenson's <ent type='GPE'>Manhattan</ent> wiretaps, it is known that <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> was 
continuing to work with his <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> business clients, who wanted to 
remove Hitler and install a puppet of their own who would make peace 
with the <ent type='ORG'>West</ent> while forging an alliance against Stalin. It was to be 
a kinder, gentler <ent type='ORG'>Third Reich</ent>, favorably disposed to <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
financial interests. . . . (4) </p>

<p> "The wiretap evidence against <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> originally was collected by a 
special section of <ent type='ORG'>Operation Safehaven</ent>, the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent> 
Department's effort to trace the movement of stolen <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> booty 
towards the end of the war. Roosevelt and <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent> Secretary Henry 
Morganthau had set up <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> by giving him the one assignment - 
intelligence chief in <ent type='GPE'>Switzerland</ent> - where he would be most tempted 
to aid his <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> clients with their money laundering."</p>

<p> Roosevelt had one thing in mind: "The sudden release of the 
Safehaven intercepts would force a public outcry to bring treason 
charges against those <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n businessmen who aided the 
enemy in time of war." Among the targets were Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>, Henry 
<ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent>, and other U.S. industrialists. (5) </p>

<p> The plan failed, however, due to <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> being "tipped off . . . 
that he was under surveillance" in time to cover his tracks. One 
possible source of the leak was Vice President Henry Wallace, "who 
constantly shared information with his brother-in-law, the <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> 
minister in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> during the war." </p>

<p> "Wallace," the authors reveal, "gave many details of his secret 
meetings with Roosevelt to the <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> diplomat." The problem was 
that, at the time, the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> "had recruited the head of the <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> 
secret service." </p>

<p> It is, perhaps, no coincidence that Roosevelt dropped Wallace 
during the 1944 election, choosing instead Senator Harry S. Truman 
as his new running mate. (6) </p>

<p> THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY</p>

<p> "After the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>' 1943 defeat at Stalingrad," write <ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent> and 
Aarons, "various <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> businessmen realized they were on the losing 
side and made plans to evacuate their wealth. The Peron government 
in <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent> was receiving the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> flight capital with open arms, 
and <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> helped it hide the money. . . . </p>

<p> "The Guinness Book of Records lists the missing <ent type='ORG'>Reichsbank</ent> treasure 
[estimated at $2.5 billion dollars] as the greatest unsolved bank 
robbery in history. Where did it go? . . . . </p>

<p> "According to our source, the bulk of the treasure was simply 
shipped a very short distance across <ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent> and through the Brenner 
Pass into <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s contacts were waiting at the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent>. The 
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent> connection was how Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> and the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> 
industrialists planned to get away with it. . . ." (7)</p>

<p> The effort was successful, according to the authors, who state that 
the "vast bulk of the wealth of the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> empire" which "disappeared 
before the end of World War II" reappeared "within a decade in the 
hands of the same men who financed Hitler's war against the <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent>. 
Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s clients were not defeated, only inconvenienced." The 
authors identify two of <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s accomplices as James Jesus Angleton 
and his father, Hugh Angleton. The <ent type='ORG'>Angletons</ent> were members of X-2, 
the <ent type='ORG'>O<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent></ent> counterintelligence branch in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent>, in 1943. </p>

<p> Like <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>, Hugh Angleton was financially involved with Axis 
powers. He was the <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an representative for <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>al Cash 
Register in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> before the war and business associate of <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>. 
When World War II broke out, the authors write, </p>

<p> ". . . Angleton was crushed financially as all his investments were 
in enemy hands. </p>

<p> "Like <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s clients, he wanted his money back. Like <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>, Hugh 
offered his services to the <ent type='ORG'>O<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent></ent>." With high-placed contacts in 
Mussolini's <ent type='ORG'>Interior</ent> Ministry, Hugh was accepted and "promoted 
rapidly in U.S. intelligence. He became second in command to Colonel 
Clifton Carter, the <ent type='ORG'>O<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent></ent> commander in <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> at the end of World War 
II." (8)</p>

<p> Perhaps the most controversial information which is now emerging 
with the release of recently declassified documents concerning World 
War II, is the role of the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent>, both in its pre-war <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> 
investments, and its role in helping <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> war criminals escape 
justice after the war. Concerning the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>German</ent> investments, 
<ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent> and Aarons are quite clear:</p>

<p> "That the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent> encouraged such investments and even donated 
money to Hitler himself cannot be denied. A <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> nun, Sister 
Pascalina, was present at its creation. In the early 1920s she was 
the housekeeper for Archbishop of the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> connection . . . 
Eugenio Pacelli, then the papal nuncio in <ent type='GPE'>Munich</ent>. Sister Pascalina 
vividly recalls receiving Adolf Hitler late one night and watching 
the archbishop give Hitler a large amount of <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent> money."</p>

<p> In addition, Eugenio Pacelli </p>

<p> "later convinced the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent> to invest millions of dollars in the 
rising <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> economy, money from the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent>'s land settlement that 
ended the Pope's claim of sovereignty over territory outside the 
walls of <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent> City. It was Pacelli who negotiated the Concordat 
with <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> and then had to deal with the consequences of his own 
mistakes when he became pope on the eve of World War II. </p>

<p> "The <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent> and the <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> brothers had the same problem. Once 
their money was in Hitler's hands, how would they get it back?"</p>

<p> The authors interviewed "a former colonel in U.S. Military 
Intelligence who specialized in tracing enemy assets. He claimed 
that only a tiny portion of the <ent type='ORG'>Reichbank</ent>'s gold ingots actually 
reached the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent> Bank, while the rest was held in cooperative 
banks in <ent type='GPE'>Belgium</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Liechtenstein</ent>, and especially <ent type='GPE'>Switzerland</ent>." It was 
only necessary to transfer the paperwork on the gold, not the gold 
itself. Since, by that time, <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> knew his telegraph 
communications were being monitored by the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> wiretap operation 
in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>, he instead used couriers to "ensure absolute secrecy in 
moving the foreign currency and the ownership documents out of 
<ent type='GPE'>Switzerland</ent> . . . special agents of the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent> who had diplomatic 
immunity to move back and forth across both <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Allied</ent> lines. . 
. ." (9)</p>

<p> ". . . . The <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent>'s eminence grise for <ent type='NORP'>Balkan</ent> intelligence, the 
<ent type='NORP'>Bosnian</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Croat</ent> priest Krunoslav Draganovic, was involved in 
transporting large quantities of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> booty, especially gold 
bullion, from <ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent> to the safety of the Holy See with the help of 
the <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>-Angleton clique in <ent type='GPE'>Rome</ent>. Some of the booty was 
transported in truck convoys run by <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> troops. Other shipments 
were carried in U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> jeeps provided to Father Draganovic so 
that he could conduct pastoral visits' on behalf of the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent>. </p>

<p> "Another ardent <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> propagandist and agent, <ent type='NORP'>Slovenian</ent> bishop 
Gregory Rozman, was sent to <ent type='GPE'>Bern</ent> with the help of <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s friends 
in U.S. intelligence. Declassified U.S. intelligence files confirm 
that Bishop Rozman was suspected of trying to arrange the transfer 
of huge quantities of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>-controlled gold and <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>ern currency that 
had been discreetly secreted in <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> banks during the war. For a 
few months the <ent type='ORG'>Allies</ent> prevented Rozman from gaining access to this 
treasure, but then the way was mysteriously cleared. In fact, the 
<ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent> connection had fixed it, and before too long the 
bishop obtained the loot for his <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> friends, who were hiding in 
<ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent>. </p>

<p> "Such instances turned out to be only the tip of the iceberg. It 
has long been acknowledged that it was Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> who tipped off 
General <ent type='ORG'>Patton</ent> about the buried <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> treasure that lay in the path 
of the U.S. Third <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Patton</ent> explicitly urged General Eisenhower 
to conceal as much of the gold as possible, but his advice was 
refused. </p>

<p> "Our sources claim that <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> and his colleagues exerted a great 
deal of influence to ensure that <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>ern investments in <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> 
were not seized by the <ent type='ORG'>Allies</ent> as reparations for the <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent>. After 
all, much of 'Hitler's Gold' had originally belonged to the bankers 
in <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>. The . . . captured <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> loot went 
underground. . . . </p>

<p> "In the cause of anticommunism, and to retrieve its own investments 
in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent> agreed to become part of <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s smuggling 
window, through which the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> and their treasure could be moved to 
safety." (10)</p>

<p> On April 12th, 1945, Roosevelt died, and Truman became President. 
May 7th, <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> surrendered after the suicide of Adolf Hitler. 
September 2nd, <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> surrendered. </p>

<p> World War II finally ended, but at the cost of more than 35000000 
lives, over half that amount civilians. The death toll for the 
<ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent> was 294000. (11) </p>

<p> A PLEDGE BETRAYED</p>

<p> "<ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> and some of his friends volunteered for postwar service 
with the government not out of patriotism but of necessity," 
according to <ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent> and Aarons. "They had to be in positions of 
power to suppress the evidence of their own dealings with the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>. 
The Safehaven investigation was quickly stripped from <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent> . . . 
and turned over to the <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> Department. There <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s friends 
shredded the index to the interlocking corporations and blocked 
further investigations. </p>

<p> "<ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> had this goal in mind: Not a single <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n businessman 
was ever going to be convicted of treason for helping the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>. 
None ever was, despite the evidence. According to one of our sources 
in the intelligence community, the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> Counter Intelligence 
Corps had two large '<ent type='ORG'>Civilian Internment Centers</ent>' in Occupied 
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>, code named '<ent type='ORG'>Ashcan</ent>' and 'Dustbin.' The <ent type='ORG'>CIC</ent> had identified 
and captured a large number of U.S. citizens who had stayed in 
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> and aided <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Third Reich</ent></ent> all through World War II. The 
evidence of their treason was overwhelming. The captured <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> 
records were horribly incriminating. </p>

<p> "Yet Victor Wohreheide, the young <ent type='ORG'>Justice Department</ent> attorney 
responsible for preparing the treason trials, suddenly ordered the 
prisoners' release. All of the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> collaborators were allowed to 
return to <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent> and reclaim their citizenship. At the 
same time, another <ent type='ORG'>Justice Department</ent> attorney, O. John Rogge, who 
dared to make a speech about <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> collaborators in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent> 
was quickly fired. However, the attorney who buried the treason 
cases was later promoted to special assistant attorney general. </p>

<p> "<ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> and his clients had won. The proof is in the bottom line. 
Forty years after World War II, Fortune magazine published a list of 
the hundred richest men in the world. There were no <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent> on the 
list. The great fortunes of the Rothschilds and Warburgs had been 
diminished to insignificance by the Depression, the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>, and World 
War II. </p>

<p> "Near the top of the list were several multibillionaires who had 
been prominent members of Hitler's inner circle. A few even had 
served time in <ent type='ORG'>Allied</ent> prisons as <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> war criminals, but they were 
all released quickly. The bottom line is that the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> businessmen 
survived the war with their fortunes intact and rebuilt their 
industrial empires to become the richest men in the world. <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s 
clients got away with it. President Roosevelt's dream of putting the 
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>' moneymen on trial died with him."</p>

<p> <ent type='GPE'>England</ent> also failed to see justice done, according to the authors: 
"The <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> authorities in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> ordered the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> to release 
all of the VIP <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> and hand over the evidence against 
them. Even before Roosevelt's death, <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>ill had already begun to 
withdraw from his commitment to prosecute <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>." The reason?" Too 
many <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> industries might be seized as <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> fronts. Too many 
upper-class collaborators might have to be prosecuted. The <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>s 
were defeated, and the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>s</ent> were now the enemy.</p>

<p> "Funding for <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> war crimes investigations suddenly dried up. 
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> bankers such as Herman Abs were released from prison to work as 
economic advisers in the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> zone of <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>. The history of 
<ent type='NORP'>British</ent> 'efforts' to punish <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> after the war is aptly summarized 
in Tom Bower's book, 'The Pledge betrayed'. . . . </p>

<p> "The pattern was repeated all over the remnants of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Third Reich</ent></ent>. 
Despite direct orders from President Truman and General Eisenhower, 
I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>, the citadel of the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> industrialists, was never 
dismantled. <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s clients demanded, and received, <ent type='ORG'>Allied</ent> 
compensation for bomb damage to their factories in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>. Only a 
few of the top <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> were executed. Most of the rest were released 
from prison within a few years. Others, . . . would go virtually 
unpunished. No one ever investigated the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> sympathizers in 
<ent type='ORG'>West</ent>ern intelligence who had made it all possible." (12)</p>

<p> As we have seen, the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n industrialists who did business with 
the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> were in no way inconvenienced by war crimes trials, and 
even received compensation for damages to their <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> war plants. 
Some <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> industrialists were charged and convicted by the <ent type='GPE'>Nuremberg</ent> 
war crimes trials but, in their book, "The <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Establishment," 
authors Leonard and Mark Silk observe that in the late 1940s "the 
<ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent> and its leaders faced an agonizing moral problem in 
coming to terms with those <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> industrialists who had willingly 
done business with the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> and who were now just as willing to do 
business with the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent> in the reconstruction of <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>. The 
problem was dramatized when those <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> industrialists who had been 
convicted of war crimes at <ent type='GPE'>Nuremberg</ent> were all released from 
Landsberg prison in early 1951, their sentences commuted by the 
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n High Commissioner [of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> Occupation], John J. McCloy. </p>

<p> ". . . . Whatever the motivation," the authors continue, "the 
blanket release of the convicted industrialists was taken within 
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> - and by them - as a sign that businessmen were not to be 
seriously blamed for their involvement in matters for which others 
were hanged or suffered long imprisonment." (13) </p>

<p> The motivation for the mass release of imprisoned <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> war 
criminals is described in the book, "The New <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> and the Old 
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>," by T.H. Tetens, an expert in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> affairs. </p>

<p> Tetens observes that in "1950, when <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> showed its eagerness 
to create a new <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> army of 500000 men, the <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> [at that time 
reorganized into a neo-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> front group called <ent type='ORG'>HIAG</ent>, which stands 
for 'mutual assistance,' a so-called veterans organization], 
together with the old <ent type='NORP'>Wehrmacht</ent> officers, started an all-out 
campaign for the immediate release of all war criminals. It was a 
superbly organized blackmail action, enjoying wide support from the 
public, from all parties, and carried toward success by Dr. 
Adenauer's astute maneuverings. </p>

<p> "The Chancellor suggested an inconspicuous way to solve the problem 
with 'parole,' 'sick leave,' and other roundabout methods. The more 
the U.S. High Commission in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> showed leniency, however, the 
stronger the pressure became: either 'all so-called war criminals 
are released or there will be no <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> army.' <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n diplomats 
followed Dr. Adenauer's plan to feed the nationalistic monster 
piecemeal. Every few days we quietly released one or two more from 
prison - the <ent type='ORG'>Krupps</ent>, the I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> directors, and dozens of former 
<ent type='NORP'>Wehrmacht</ent> Generals. On friendly advice from <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> 
and the <ent type='NORP'>French</ent>, extremely reluctant, had to follow suit. When the 
supply dried up, there remained behind bars only the <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>, the mass 
murderers from <ent type='GPE'>Dachau</ent>, Belsen, and <ent type='ORG'>Buchenwald</ent>, and the toughs from 
the Waffen <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> who had massacred <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n, <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>, and <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> 
prisoners of war. This put High Commissioner John McCloy in a most 
embarrassing position. . . ." </p>

<p> Tetens explains how Chancellor Adenauer helped High Commissioner 
McCloy and the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> Department avoid this embarrassment: 
Adenauer "suggested the formation of a review board, with three 
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent> members sitting in and having equal voice in making 
recommendations. The whole procedure was to be shrouded in secrecy, 
and it was decided that the names of those released should not be 
revealed to the public. In this way the last few hundred 'poor 
devils,' those <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> mass killers and sadists, were quietly set free 
within two or three years." (14) </p>

<p> Christopher Simpson, in his extensively documented book on the 
subject of U.S. recruitment of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>, "Blowback," goes into more 
detail of the backgrounds of those released: </p>

<p> "The beneficiaries of this act included, for example, all of the 
convicted concentration camp doctors; all of the top judges who had 
administered the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>' 'special courts'" and dozens of similar 
cases. In addition, "McCloy's clemency decisions for the Landsberg 
inmates set in motion a much broader process that eventually freed 
hundreds of other convicted <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> war criminals over the next five 
years. . . . By the winter of 1950-1951 the most senior levels of 
the U.S. government had decided to abrogate their wartime pledge to 
bring <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> war criminals to justice. . . . in the interests of 
preserving <ent type='ORG'>West</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> military support for <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n leadership in 
the cold war. While <ent type='NORP'>nazism</ent> and Hitler's inner circle continued to be 
publicly condemned throughout the <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>, the actual investigation and 
prosecution of specific <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> crimes came to a standstill." (15) </p>

<p> One case merits special attention: Sepp Dietrich, "the organizer of 
the Fuehrer's bodyguard. Dietrich carried out Hitler's personal 
murder assignments" and, Tetens continues, "was in charge of the 
liquidation of the <ent type='NORP'>Jewish</ent> population in the city of <ent type='GPE'>Kharkov</ent>. During 
the Battle of the Bulge his troops committed the <ent type='ORG'>Malmedy</ent> massacre, 
killing more than 600 military and civilian prisoners, among them 
115 <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n G.I.s. He was sentenced to death, and the sentence was 
later commuted to life imprisonment. In 1955 he was one of the last 
poor devils' quietly released from prison and greeted by the <ent type='GPE'>Bonn</ent> 
government with the homecoming pay of 6000 marks." (16) </p>

<p> In a "<ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> Times" article published February 1, 1951, one 
prominent <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n expressed support for the reduction of sentences 
for those responsible for the mass murder of the 600 unarmed 
prisoners of war at <ent type='ORG'>Malmedy</ent>, describing the decision as "extremely 
wise." The <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n was Senator Joseph McCarthy, <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> from 
<ent type='GPE'>Wisconsin</ent>. </p>

<p> Tetens observes that, despite the wide-spread fear by "the <ent type='NORP'>French</ent>, 
the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>, and the smaller <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an countries" of a re-militarized 
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>, "the outbreak of the <ent type='GPE'>Korea</ent>n War (June 1950) brought a total 
change. The provisions which banned all military and veterans' 
organizations lost all their meaning and were no longer enforced. 
<ent type='ORG'>West</ent>ern <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> was allowed by the <ent type='ORG'>Allies</ent> to set up its own General 
Staff, camouflaged under the name Blank Office. Supported by <ent type='GPE'>Bonn</ent> 
and tolerated by <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>, a nation-wide network was 
created to reactivate the experienced officers and the man power of 
the old <ent type='NORP'>Wehrmacht</ent>. The short period of 1950-51 must be marked as the 
time when Hitler's old officers, <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> leaders, and [<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>] party 
functionaries returned to power and influence." (17) </p>

<p> Tetens' comment that the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>'s return to power in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> was 
"tolerated by <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>" was a historical understatement. By 
the time Tetens' book was published in 1961, hundreds of convicted 
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> war criminals had already been smuggled out of <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> to avoid 
prosecution at the war crimes trials at <ent type='GPE'>Nuremberg</ent>, recruited by, and 
on the payroll of several U.S. government agencies, including the 
<ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> <ent type='ORG'>CIC</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>O<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent></ent>, and <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Office of Policy Coordination</ent></ent> within the 
<ent type='ORG'>State</ent> Department. </p>

<p> Over the past fifty years, it is now documented, these <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>nized 
fugitive <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> war criminals have been involved in, and in many cases 
in charge of, many U.S. government covert operations -- 
international weapons smuggling, drug cartels, <ent type='ORG'>Central</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
death squads, right wing anti-<ent type='NORP'>communist</ent> dictatorships, LSD mind 
control experiments -- the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>al Committee's Ethnic 
Heritage Councils, and the Presidential campaigns of Richard Nixon, 
Ronald Reagan, and George Bush. </p>

<p> THE GEHLEN ORGANIZATION </p>

<p> Probably the most influential <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> to come to work for the United 
<ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s intelligence agencies during the Cold War was named Gehlen. </p>

<p> "Reinhard Gehlen," writes author Christopher Simpson, "Hitler's 
most senior military intelligence officer on the eastern front, had 
begun planning his surrender to <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent> at least as early 
as the fall of 1944." Of "several hundred" high-ranking <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> 
officers who switched sides at the end of World War II, Gehlen 
"proved to be the most important of them all. </p>

<p> "In early March 1945 Gehlen and a small group of his most senior 
officers carefully microfilmed the vast holdings on the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent>SR in the 
. . . military intelligence section of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> army's general 
staff. They packed the film in watertight steel drums and secretly 
buried it in remote mountain meadows scattered through the <ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent>n 
<ent type='LOC'>Alps</ent>. Then, on May 22, 1945, Gehlen and his top aides surrendered to 
an <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Counter-intelligence Corps [<ent type='ORG'>CIC</ent>] team." (18) </p>

<p> According to Tetens: ". . . [Gehlen] immediately asked for an 
interview with the commanding officer . . ." and offered the United 
<ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s "his intelligence staff, spy apparatus, and the priceless 
files for future service." </p>

<p> Gehlen was sent to <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> and his offer was taken. "The 
<ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>-Gehlen agreement," states Tetens, "in practice guaranteed 
the continuation of the all-important <ent type='ORG'>Abwehr</ent> division of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> 
General Staff. Hundreds of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> army and <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> officers were quietly 
released from internment camps and joined Gehlen's headquarters in 
<ent type='LOC'>the Spessart Mountains</ent> in central <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>. When the staff had grown 
to three thousand men, <ent type='ORG'>the Bureau Gehlen</ent> opened a closely guarded 
twenty-five-acre compound near <ent type='GPE'>Pullach</ent>, south of <ent type='GPE'>Munich</ent>, operating 
under the innocent name of the <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> Industrial Development 
Organization. . . . </p>

<p> "Within a few years the Gehlen apparatus had grown by leaps and 
bounds. In the early fifties it was estimated that the organization 
employed up to 4000 intelligence specialists in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>, mainly 
former army and <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> officers, and that more than 4000 V-men 
(undercover agents) were active throughout the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>-bloc 
countries. Gehlen's spy network stretches from <ent type='GPE'>Korea</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Cairo</ent>, from 
<ent type='LOC'>Siberia</ent> to Santiago de <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent>. . . . When <ent type='GPE'>the Federal Republic</ent> [of 
<ent type='ORG'>West</ent> <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>] became a sovereign state in 1955, <ent type='ORG'>the Bureau Gehlen</ent> 
was openly recognized as the official intelligence arm of the <ent type='GPE'>Bonn</ent> 
government." (19) </p>

<p> How important was <ent type='ORG'>the Gehlen Org</ent>, as it became known, to the 
history of the Cold War? Simpson's research documents that it was 
perhaps the most significant element of all:</p>

<p> ". . . . The Org became the most important eyes and ears for U.S. 
intelligence inside the closed societies of the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> bloc. 'In 
1946 [U.S.] intelligence files on the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union were virtually 
empty,' says Harry Rositzke, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>'s former chief of espionage 
inside the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union. '. . . . Rositzke worked closely with 
Gehlen during the formative years of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and credits Gehlen's 
organization with playing a "primary role" in filling the empty file 
folders during that period. . . .' </p>

<p> "'Gehlen had to make his money by creating a threat that we were 
afraid of,' says Victor <ent type='ORG'>Marchetti</ent>, formerly the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>'s chief analyst 
of <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> strategic war plans and capabilities, 'so we would give 
him more money to tell us about it.' He continues: 'In my opinion, 
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>the Gehlen Org</ent>anization</ent> provided nothing worthwhile for the 
understanding or estimating <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> military or political 
capabilities in <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> or anywhere else.' Employing Gehlen 
was 'a waste of time, money, and effort, except that maybe he had 
some CI [counter- intelligence] value, because practically everybody 
in his organization was sucking off both tits.'" (20) </p>

<p> By 'sucking off both tits' <ent type='ORG'>Marchetti</ent> is referring to the fact that 
Gehlen's elaborate operation was penetrated by <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> spies at the 
very time it was our most important source of intelligence upon 
which the Cold War was based. In fact, the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent>s</ent> had 
infiltrated <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> intelligence long before Gehlen switched sides. </p>

<p> TRIPLE CR<ent type='ORG'>O<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent></ent> </p>

<p> "In each generation," write Aarons and <ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent>,"<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> intelligence 
created 'anti-<ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent>' emigre front groups, ostensibly to foment 
revolution and topple <ent type='NORP'>Bolshevism</ent>. The front groups attracted support 
from the <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>. Considerable financial assistance was supplied and 
close ties forged with various <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>ern intelligence services. This 
enabled the <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> double agents running the front groups to co-
opt the legitimate emigre opposition, splinter their leadership and 
provoke them into premature and poorly organized rebellions which 
were easily defeated. More importantly, the false front groups were 
a vehicle for long-term <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> penetration of <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>ern society. . . 
." </p>

<p> The authors identify one of these groups as the <ent type='ORG'>Narodny</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Trudovoi</ent> 
Soyuz (<ent type='ORG'>NTS</ent>), or <ent type='ORG'>the People</ent>'s Labour Alliance. The <ent type='ORG'>NTS</ent> represented 
itself as a group of anti-<ent type='NORP'>communist</ent> "moles" inside the <ent type='ORG'>Kremlin</ent> and, 
in the 1920s, recruited a <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> agent named Prince Anton 
Vasilevich <ent type='NORP'>Turkel</ent>. <ent type='NORP'>Turkel</ent>, who actually worked for <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Military 
intelligence (<ent type='ORG'>GRU</ent>), went on to penetrate <ent type='NORP'>French</ent>, <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>ese</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>, 
<ent type='NORP'>British</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>, and even the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent> intelligence services before 
the end of World War II. </p>

<p> "After World War II, <ent type='NORP'>Turkel</ent> worked for <ent type='ORG'>West</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> intelligence 
(<ent type='ORG'>the Gehlen Org</ent>), collaborated with many of the spy services of 
<ent type='ORG'>NATO</ent>, including the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Military Intelligence Service (MIS - 
for offensive intelligence), the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> Counter Intelligence Corps 
(<ent type='ORG'>CIC</ent> - for defensive purposes), the ultra-secret <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> Department 
Office of Policy Co-ordination and <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Central</ent> Intelligence Agency</ent>. 
. ." (21) </p>

<p> "Just before World War II began," according to the authors, "an 
<ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent>n Jew named Richard <ent type='ORG'>Kauder</ent> created a secret intelligence 
network, code named <ent type='ORG'>MAX</ent>." <ent type='ORG'>Kauder</ent>, using the name of [Max] Klatt - 
<ent type='NORP'>Turkel</ent>'s intelligence chief ["Unholy <ent type='ORG'>Trinity</ent>," Aarons and <ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent>, p. 
166] - "worked exclusively for Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> 
spy chief who collaborated with the <ent type='ORG'>Vatican</ent> and the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> to 
topple Hitler during the war [the group known as the Black 
Orchestra]." </p>

<p> The <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> thought the Max network was made up of "so-called <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> 
<ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent>" who "were willing to spy against the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union, not for the 
glory of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Third Reich</ent></ent> but to save themselves and their families 
from the concentration camps." The Max network was supposed to have 
had "the only communication link to a secret network of '<ent type='ORG'>White</ent>' 
<ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>s inside the <ent type='ORG'>Kremlin</ent> [<ent type='NORP'>Turkel</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>NTS</ent>], who had 
supposedly infiltrated Stalin's military headquarters prior to World 
War II." But, the authors continue, "the Max network was not made up 
of <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent>. They were, in fact, <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent> who risked their 
lives inside the heart of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Third Reich</ent></ent>'s intelligence service." </p>

<p> The Max network actually misled the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>, feeding them false 
intelligence on the capabilities and intentions of the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union, 
leading "the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> divisions into a series of death traps on the 
<ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> front." The Max double-agents were responsible for the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> 
defeats at Stalingrad, "the giant battle of Kursk where Hitler's 
tank divisions were slaughtered. The final sting," continue the 
authors, "was to mislead <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> into believing that the Red army 
was on the verge of collapse in 1944, when in fact the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>s</ent> were 
preparing for the most massive onslaught of the war. </p>

<p> "It would not be an exaggeration to say that the '<ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent>' of 
the Max network did more to defeat the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> army than all the 
<ent type='ORG'>West</ent>ern intelligence services combined. Seventy percent of all 
Hitler's divisions were destroyed on the <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> front, largely as a 
result of the misleading intelligence supplied by Max." (22) </p>

<p> When Gehlen was recruited by <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>, Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> 
ordered the ex-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> spymaster to "revive the Max network." Gehlen 
already had plans to do just that, intending "to make <ent type='NORP'>Turkel</ent>'s Max 
network the centerpiece of his new <ent type='ORG'>West</ent> <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> intelligence agency. 
As soon as a <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> president was elected in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>, 
<ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> intended to take over the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and make Gehlen and <ent type='NORP'>Turkel</ent> the 
heart of his anti-<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> network. The <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>s</ent>, of course, were 
delighted as they watched <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> and Gehlen attempt to plant a 
<ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> spy ring in the heart of <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>ern intelligence. . . .</p>

<p> ". . . [E]ventually, in 1956, the <ent type='ORG'>Allies</ent> decided that the whole 
thing had been a giant <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>-controlled operation. Dozens of 
operations, hundreds of agents, thousands of innocent civilians had 
been betrayed. . . . </p>

<p> ". . . [T]hree years after <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> became head of <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> in 1953, his 
pet '<ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>,' <ent type='NORP'>Turkel</ent>, broadcast the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> codes to start the 
<ent type='NORP'>Hungarian</ent> uprising prematurely. Thousands of innocent <ent type='NORP'>Hungarian</ent>s 
rushed on to the streets of <ent type='GPE'>Budapest</ent> to start the revolution. 
Instead of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n paratroopers dropping supplies, they found 
<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> tanks waiting in the suburbs."</p>

<p> By 1959, the collapse of <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s spy network was almost total: 
"U.S. Military Intelligence admitted to the <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>al Security 
Council that it did not have a single network of couriers or safe 
houses left in <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> territory, apart from East <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>. 
<ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> 'freedom fighters' had sold him out." (23) </p>

<p> COLD WARRIORS </p>

<p> It was Harry Rositze who best described the attitude of the United 
<ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s military-intelligence establishment after the end of World 
War II: "Any bastard as long as he was anti-<ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent>." Rositze, the 
"former head of secret operations inside the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent>SR" for the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, was 
correct. (24) </p>

<p> We have seen that many <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> - including those who committed 
atrocities - returned to positions of power and influence inside 
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> after the war. Unknown until fairly recently was the extent 
of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> recruitment by U.S. intelligence agencies and political 
organizations, in the 1940s and 1950s. </p>

<p> Perhaps the most publicized program of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> recruitment is that of 
<ent type='ORG'>Project Paperclip</ent>, which involved the collection of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> rocket 
scientists and facilities, all of which were later incorporated into 
the U.S. Space Program. Klaus Barbie's employment by the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> 
Department in the 1940s is another well-known incident. Barbie, head 
of the <ent type='ORG'>Gestapo</ent> in Lyons, <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>, was known as the "Butcher of Lyons" 
and was sought by the <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> Government for atrocities committed 
against <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> Resistance fighters captured by the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>. Barbie was 
recruited as a U.S. intelligence "asset" in 1947 by one branch of 
the <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> Department's Counter-intelligence Corps (<ent type='ORG'>CIC</ent>), while 
another branch, <ent type='ORG'>the Operation Selection Board</ent>, a joint U.S./<ent type='NORP'>British</ent> 
project, was trying to put him in prison for war crimes. </p>

<p> Eventually, according to Aarons and <ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent>, "Barbie's employment 
(and protection) by the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent> began to reach <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> newspapers 
and politicians at least as early as 1948. They, in turn brought 
increasing pressure on the U.S. government through publicity and 
eventually through official notes requesting Barbie's extradition 
from <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>. That, in the final analysis, is why the <ent type='ORG'>CIC</ent> chose to 
provide Barbie with a new identity and safe passage to <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent> in 
1951, while thousands of other ex-<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> who had been 'of interest' 
to the <ent type='ORG'>CIC</ent> at one time or another have simply lived out their lives 
in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>. If the <ent type='ORG'>CIC</ent> had dumped Barbie when the <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> government 
began requesting his extradition, he would have had plenty of 
compromising things to say about the <ent type='ORG'>CIC</ent>. . ." (25) </p>

<p> But when Barbie was eventually captured by <ent type='NORP'>Bolivian</ent> authorities in 
the early 1980s, and returned to <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> to face charges of war 
crimes, the U.S. government was forced to conduct an investigation 
into the Barbie affair. The official position? ". . . [T]his 
investigation concluded that <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent> had indeed protected 
Barbie in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> and engineered his escape but that Barbie was the 
only such <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> who had been assisted in this fashion." (26) </p>

<p> As documented previously, this statement was false. Hundreds, 
perhaps thousands, of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> were employed by the several U.S. 
agencies, from the <ent type='ORG'>CIC</ent> to the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, and used in covert operations 
overseas, as our first line of defense against Communism. Others, 
equally as guilty of wartime atrocities, were brought into the 
<ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent> for domestic political purposes. This aspect of the 
U.S.-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> connection is well-documented, and deserves closer 
attention by the mainstream press. </p>

<p> One of the first researchers to reveal the connections between the 
U.S. government and the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>, was a lady named Mae <ent type='ORG'>Brussell</ent> of 
<ent type='GPE'>Carmel</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>. Her career as a conspiracy researcher and host 
of the weekly radio program "<ent type='ORG'>World Watchers International</ent>" began 
with the Kennedy assassination. "In ferreting out every morsel from 
the Warren Report," writes Jonathan Vankin, author of the book 
"Conspiracies, Cover-ups and Crimes," "supplementing her research 
with untold amounts of reading from the '<ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> Times' to 'Soldier 
of Fortune,' <ent type='ORG'>Brussell</ent> discovered not merely a conspiracy of a few 
renegade <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agents, <ent type='ORG'>Mafiosi</ent>, and Castro haters behind Kennedy's 
death, but a vast, invisible institutional structure layered into 
the very fabric of the U.S. political system.</p>

<p> "Comprising the government within a government were not just spies, 
gangsters, and <ent type='NORP'>Cubans</ent>, but <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>. Mae found that many of the 
commission witnesses -- whose testimony established Oswald as a lone 
nut' -- had never even spoken to Oswald, or knew him only slightly. 
The bulk of them were <ent type='ORG'>White</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent> emigres living in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. 
Extreme in their anti-Communism, they were often affiliated with 
groups set up by the <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> in World War II -- <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an ethnic 
armies used by the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> to carry out their dirtiest work. </p>

<p> "<ent type='ORG'>Brussell</ent> also discovered an episode from history rarely reported 
in the media, and not often taught in universities. Those same 
collaborationist groups were absorbed by <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent> intelligence 
agencies. They hooked up with the spy net of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> General Reinhard 
Gehlen, Hitler's <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> Front espionage chief."</p>

<p> "'This is a story of how key <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> . . . anticipated military 
disaster and laid plans to transplant <ent type='NORP'>nazism</ent>, intact but disguised, 
in havens in the <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>,' wrote Mae <ent type='ORG'>Brussell</ent> in 1983. She didn't 
author too many articles, but this one, 'The <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> Connection to the 
John F. Kennedy Assassination' (in 'The Rebel,' a short-lived 
political magazine published by '<ent type='ORG'>Hustler</ent>' impresario Larry Flynt), 
was definitive, albeit convoluted. </p>

<p> "'It is a story that climaxes in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> on November 22, 1963, when 
John Kennedy was struck down,' <ent type='ORG'>Brussell</ent>'s article continued. 'And it 
is a story with an aftermath -- <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s slide to the brink of 
Fascism.'" </p>

<p> Mae <ent type='ORG'>Brussell</ent> quit broadcasting her radio show in Spring of 1988, 
after receiving a death threat from a "man who is said to have 
identified himself as 'a fascist and proud of it.'" </p>

<p> The last project she worked on, before her death from cancer on 
October 3, 1988, writes the author, "was a study of Satanic cults -- 
within the U.S. military. The hidden fascist oligarchy had 
progressed far beyond the need for patsies like Oswald. They were 
now able, <ent type='ORG'>Brussell</ent> asserted, to hypnotically program assassins. </p>

<p> "Satanic cults are the state of the art in brainwashing. With 
drugs, sex, and violence, they strip any semblance of moral thought. 
They are perfect for use in creating killers. The <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent> 
military, <ent type='ORG'>Brussell</ent> found, was using them." (27) </p>

<p> RICHARD MILHO<ent type='GPE'>US</ent>E NIXON </p>

<p> In this section we will explore the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> connections of Richard 
Nixon. To do so we must return to the years just after the end of 
World War II and, of course, a man named <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>. </p>

<p> The irony of Nixon's political career ending with a cover-up can 
only be appreciated with the knowledge that this turbulent career 
also began with one. <ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent> and Aarons state that: </p>

<p> "According to several of our sources among the 'old spies,' Richard 
Nixon's political career began in 1945, when he was the <ent type='ORG'>navy</ent> officer 
temporarily assigned to review . . . captured <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> documents." The 
documents in question revealed the wartime record of Karl Blessing, 
"former <ent type='ORG'>Reichsbank</ent> officer and then head of the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> oil cartel, 
<ent type='GPE'>Kontinentale</ent> Ol A.G. 'Konti' was in partnership with <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s 
principal <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> client, I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>. Both companies had despicable 
records regarding their treatment of <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent> during the Holocaust. 
After the war <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> not only 'lost' Blessings <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> party records, 
but he helped peddle a false biography in the ever-gullible 'New 
York Times.'" </p>

<p> The authors' sources reveal that not only did <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> help cover up 
his <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> client's record, he "personally vouched for Blessing as an 
anti-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> in order to protect continued control of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> oil 
interests in the Middle East. Blessing's Konti was the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> link to 
Iben Saud [King of Saudi <ent type='NORP'>Arab</ent>ia] and <ent type='ORG'>Aramco</ent> [the <ent type='NORP'>Arab</ent>ian- <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
Oil Company]. If Blessing went down, he could have taken a lot of 
people with him, including Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>. The cover-up worked, except 
that U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Naval Intelligence</ent> scrutinized a set of the captured Konti 
records." </p>

<p> According to the "old spies," Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> made a deal with the 
young <ent type='ORG'>navy</ent> officer who was reviewing the Konti files - Richard 
Nixon. Nixon would help <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> bury the Konti files. In return, 
Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> "arranged to finance [Nixon's] first congressional 
campaign against Jerry Voorhis." (1) </p>

<p> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s support for Nixon paid off in 1947 when, as the freshman 
congressman from <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>, he "saved John <ent type='ORG'>Foster</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> 
considerable embarrassment by privately pointing out that 
confidential government files showed that one of <ent type='ORG'>Foster</ent>'s foundation 
employees, Alger Hiss, was allegedly a <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent>. The <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> 
brothers took Nixon under their wing and escorted him on a tour of 
<ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> 'freedom fighter' operations in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>, apparently in 
anticipation that the young congressman would be useful after Dewey 
became president." [He would be useful anyway, despite the fact that 
incumbent President Truman won reelection in 1948, defeating Dewey.] 
(2) </p>

<p> After Truman's victory, write the authors, "Nixon became Allen 
<ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s mouthpiece in <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>. Both he and Senator Joseph McCarthy 
received volumes of classified information to support the charge 
that the Truman administration was filled with 'pinkos.' When 
McCarthy went too far in his <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> investigations, it was Nixon 
who worked with his next-door neighbor, <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> director Bedell Smith, 
to steer the investigations away from the intelligence community.</p>

<p> "The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> was grateful for Nixon's assistance, but did not know the 
reason for it. <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> had been recruiting <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> under the cover of 
the <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> Department's <ent type='ORG'>Office of Policy Coordination</ent>, whose chief, 
Frank Wisner, had systematically recruited the <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an 
emigre networks that had worked first for the <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>, then the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>, 
and finally <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>. </p>

<p> "The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> did not know it, but <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> was bringing them to the 
<ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent> less for intelligence purposes than for political 
advantage. The <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>' job quickly became to get out the vote for the 
<ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>s. One <ent type='NORP'>Israeli</ent> intelligence officer joked that when <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> 
used the phrase 'Never Again,' he was not talking about the 
Holocaust but about Dewey's narrow loss to Truman. In the eyes of 
the <ent type='NORP'>Israeli</ent>s, Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> was the demon who infected <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>ern 
intelligence with <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> recruits. </p>

<p> "In preparation for the 1952 Eisenhower-Nixon campaign, the 
<ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>s formed an <ent type='ORG'>Ethnic Division</ent>, which, to put it bluntly, 
recruited the 'displaced <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>s' who arrived in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent> 
after World War II. Like similar migrant organizations in several 
<ent type='ORG'>West</ent>ern countries, the <ent type='ORG'>Ethnic Division</ent> attracted a significant 
number of <ent type='ORG'>Central</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>, who had been recruited 
by the <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> as political and police leaders during the Holocaust. 
These <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> emigres supported the Eisenhower-Nixon 'liberation' 
policy as the quickest means of getting back into power in their 
former homelands and made a significant contribution 'in its first 
operation (1951/1952).'"</p>

<p> The authors point out that "over the years the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>s</ent> had 
acquired one or two <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> of their own, such as Tscherim Soobzokov, 
a former member of the Caucasian <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> who worked as a party boss in 
<ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent>. But in 90 percent of the cases, the members of Hitler's 
political organization went to the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>s. In fact, from the 
very beginning, the word had been put around among <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an 
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> that <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> and Nixon were the men to see, especially if you 
were a rich <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> . . ." (3) </p>

<p> This relationship between Richard Nixon and the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> developed 
because both he and Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> "blamed Governor Dewey's razor-thin 
loss to Truman in the 1948 presidential election on the <ent type='NORP'>Jewish</ent> vote. 
When [Nixon] became Eisenhower's vice president in 1952, Nixon was 
determined to build his own ethnic base.</p>

<p> "Vice President Nixon's secret political war of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> against <ent type='NORP'>Jews</ent> 
in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n politics was never investigated at the time. The foreign 
language-speaking <ent type='NORP'>Croat</ent>ian and other <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> emigre groups had a 
ready-made network for contacting and mobilizing the <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> 
<ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an ethnic bloc. There is a very high correlation between <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> 
domestic subsidies to <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> 'freedom fighters' during the 1950s 
and the leadership of the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> party's ethnic campaign groups. 
The motive for under-the-table financing was clear: Nixon used <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> 
to offset the <ent type='NORP'>Jewish</ent> vote for the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>s</ent>. </p>

<p> "In 1952 Nixon had formed an <ent type='ORG'>Ethnic Division</ent> within the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> 
<ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>al Committee. 'Displaced <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>s, hoping to be returned to 
power by an Eisenhower-Nixon "liberation" policy signed on' with the 
committee. In 1953, when <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>s were in office, the immigration 
laws were changed to admit <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>, even members of the <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>. They 
flooded into the country. Nixon himself oversaw the new immigration 
program. As vice president, he even received <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an 
<ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>s in <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>White</ent> <ent type='ORG'>House</ent></ent>. After a long, long journey, the 
<ent type='NORP'>Croat</ent>ian <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> had found a new home in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>, where they 
reestablished their networks. </p>

<p> "In 1968 Nixon promised that if he won the presidential election, 
he would create a permanent ethnic council within the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> 
party. Previously the <ent type='ORG'>Ethnic Division</ent> was allowed to surface only 
during presidential campaigns. Nixon's promise was carried out after 
the 1972 election, during [George] Bush's tenure as chairman of the 
<ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>al Committee. The <ent type='NORP'>Croat</ent>ian Ustashis became an 
integral part of the campaign structure of <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> politics, 
along with several other <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> organizations." (4)</p>

<p> The authors describe Nixon's pro-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> activities in no uncertain 
terms: "Nixon himself personally recruited ex-<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> for his 1968 
presidential campaign. Moreover, Vice President Nixon became the 
point man for the Eisenhower administration on covert operations and 
personally supervised Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s projects while Ike was ill in 
1956 and 1957." (5) </p>

<p> One of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> recruited by candidate Nixon was Laszlo <ent type='ORG'>Pasztor</ent>, 
described by Aarons and <ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent> as "the founding chair of Nixon's 
<ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> Heritage Groups council" who, "during World War II . . . 
was a diplomat in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent> representing the <ent type='ORG'>Arrow Cross</ent> government of 
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Hungary</ent>, which supervised the extermination of the <ent type='NORP'>Jewish</ent> 
population.</p>

<p> "[A]fter Nixon won [the 1968 Presidential Election], he approved 
<ent type='ORG'>Pasztor</ent>'s appointment as chief organizer of the ethnic council. Not 
surprisingly, <ent type='ORG'>Pasztor</ent>'s 'choices for filling emigre slots as the 
council was being formed included various <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> collaborationist 
organizations.' The former <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>s were coming out of the closet in 
droves. </p>

<p> "The policy of the Nixon <ent type='ORG'>White</ent> <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> was an 'open door' for emigre 
<ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>s, and through the door came such guests as Ivan <ent type='ORG'>Docheff</ent>, 
head of the Bulgarian <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>al Front and chairman of the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
Friends of the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>s (ABN). . . . an 
organization dominated by war criminals and fugitive <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>s. Yet 
Nixon welcomed them with open arms and even had <ent type='ORG'>Docheff</ent> to breakfast 
for a prayer meeting to celebrate Captive <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>s Week." (6) </p>

<p> "During Nixon's 'Four More Years' campaign in 1971-1972, Laszlo 
<ent type='ORG'>Pasztor</ent> again played a key role in marshaling the ethnic vote. No 
longer a marginal player on the fringes, now he held a key position 
as the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>al Committee's nationalities director. . . . </p>

<p> "The <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> leadership cannot claim ignorance as a defense. 
[Syndicated Columnist Jack] Anderson's famous expose of Nixon's 
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> appeared in 'The <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> Post' at the same time as the 
November 1971 convention. Among those mentioned was Laszlo <ent type='ORG'>Pasztor</ent>, 
'the industrious head of the <ent type='ORG'>GOP</ent> ethnic groups, [who] was never 
asked about his wartime activities in <ent type='GPE'>Hungary</ent> by the four <ent type='ORG'>GOP</ent> 
officials who interviewed him for his job.' It was too embarrassing 
for Nixon to admit that <ent type='ORG'>Pasztor</ent> had been a ranking member of a 
<ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> government at war with <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>. </p>

<p> ". . . . It is one thing to promote obscure <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an 
<ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> movements in the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> party. It is quite another to 
let the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> have a major influence. After 1953, the 
<ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> administration changed the rules, and even members of the 
Waffen <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> could immigrate to <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent> as long as they 
claimed only to have fought the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent>s</ent> on the <ent type='ORG'>Eastern</ent> Front." 
(7)</p>

<p> The <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>/Nixon attraction to <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>m was also observed by 
Robert J. Groden and Harrison Edward Livingstone, authors of the 
book, "High Treason," dealing with the Kennedy Assassination. Groden 
and Livingstone write: "Nixon surrounded himself with what was known 
as the <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent> Wall, a long succession of advisors with <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>ic 
names: We recall at the top of his '<ent type='NORP'>German</ent> General Staff' as it was 
also known, <ent type='ORG'>Haldeman</ent>, Erlichman, Krogh, Kliendienst, Kissinger (the 
<ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s' emissary) and many others. </p>

<p> "The selection of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> names was no accident. Many of the 
brighter staff people close to Nixon came to him from the University 
of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='LOC'>South</ent>ern</ent> <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>, and the University of <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> at Los 
Angeles, where there were fraternities that kept alive the vision of 
a new Reich. <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> has for a long time harbored this dark side of 
its character, one of violence and the Valhalla of Wagner and 
Hitler. </p>

<p> "But Gordon Liddy was the one in whose mind '<ent type='ORG'>Triumph</ent> of the Will' 
was the most alive. Some of these men would watch the great <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> 
propaganda films in the basement of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>White</ent> <ent type='ORG'>House</ent></ent> until all hours 
of the night, and drink, in fact, get drunk with their power, with 
blind ambition, as one of them wrote." (8) </p>

<p> "According to several of our sources in the intelligence community 
who were in a position to know," continue <ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent> and Aarons, "the 
secret rosters of the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> party's <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>alities Council read 
like a Who's Who of <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> fugitives. The <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>'s <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> 
connection is the darkest secret of the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> leadership. The 
rosters will never be disclosed to the public. As will be seen in 
Chapter 16 dealing with George Bush, the <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> connection is too 
widespread for damage control. </p>

<p> "According to a 1988 study by Russ Bellant of Political Research 
Associates, virtually all of the <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> organizations of World War 
II opened up a <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> party front group during the Nixon 
administration. The caliber of the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> ethnic leaders can be 
gauged by one <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent> man, Emanuel Jasiuk, a notorious mass 
murderer from what is today called the independent nation of 
<ent type='GPE'>Belarus</ent>, formerly part of the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union. But not all <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
ethnic communities are represented in the <ent type='ORG'>GOP</ent>'s ethnic section; 
there are no black or <ent type='NORP'>Jewish</ent> heritage groups. . . . </p>

<p> "The truth is that the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> immigrants were 'tar babies' that no 
one knew how to get rid of. <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> had brought in a handful of the 
top emigre politicians in the late 1940s. They in turn sponsored 
their friends in the 1950s. By the 1960s ex-<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> who had originally 
fled to <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent> were moving to <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>. . . ." (9)</p>

<p> It is clear that, even before the break-in at the <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>ic Party 
Headquarters on June 17, 1972, the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>s were on the brink of 
having their pro-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> activities over the past four decades become a 
matter of mass-media attention. After the Watergate Break-in, as the 
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>ional Hearings began to reveal the slush-funds, money-
laundering, illegal corporate campaign contributions, the political 
sabotage of the 1972 Presidential election process, the involvement 
of <ent type='ORG'>ITT</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>the Nixon Administration</ent> into the assassination of 
Salvador Allende, the democratically elected president of <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent>, and 
many other aspects of <ent type='NORP'>Nixonism</ent>, the floodgates of truth were about 
to open. Only one thing averted this wholesale learning of the truth 
by the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n people: Nixon's resignation and subsequent pardoning 
by his hand-picked successor, Gerald <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent>. </p>

<p> GEORGE HERBERT WALKER B<ent type='GPE'>US</ent>H </p>

<p> Like Richard Nixon, George Bush was a strong anti-marijuana/hemp 
president, escalating the so-called "war on drugs" begun by Nixon. 
And, like Nixon, George Bush was deeply involved with supporting the 
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> in the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent>'s closet. In fact, support for the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> was 
a Bush family tradition which goes back more than six decades and, 
once again, to Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>. </p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent> and Aarons write: "The real story of George Bush starts well 
before he launched his own career. It goes back to the 1920s, when 
the <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> brothers and the other pirates of Wall Street were making 
their deals with the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent>. . . ." </p>

<p> THE B<ent type='GPE'>US</ent>H-DULLES-<ent type='NORP'>NAZI</ent> CONNECTION</p>

<p> "George Bush's problems were inherited from his namesake and 
maternal grandfather, George Herbert 'Bert' Walker, a native of St. 
Louis, who founded the banking and investment firm of G. H. Walker 
and Company in 1900. Later the company shifted from St. Louis to the 
prestigious address of 1 Wall Street. . . . </p>

<p> "Walker was one of Hitler's most powerful financial supporters in 
<ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>. The relationship went all the way back to 1924, 
when Fritz <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent>, the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> industrialist, was financing Hitler's 
infant <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> party. As mentioned in earlier chapters, there were 
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n contributors as well. </p>

<p> "Some <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent> were just bigots and made their connections to 
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> through Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s firm of Sullivan and <ent type='ORG'>Cromwell</ent> because 
they supported Fascism. The <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> brothers, who were in it for 
profit more than ideology, arranged <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n investments in <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> 
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> in the 1930s to ensure that their clients did well out of 
the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> economic recovery. . . . </p>

<p> "Sullivan &amp; <ent type='ORG'>Cromwell</ent> was not the only firm engaged in funding 
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>. According to 'The Splendid Blond Beast,' Christopher 
Simpson's seminal history of the politics of genocide and profit, 
<ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent> was another bank that specialized in 
investments in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>. The key figure was <ent type='ORG'>Averill <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent></ent>, a 
dominating figure in the <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n establishment. . . . </p>

<p> "The firm originally was known as W. A. <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent> &amp; Company. The 
link between <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent> &amp; Company's <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n investors and <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> 
started in the 1920s, through <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking</ent> Corporation</ent>, which 
began trading in 1924. In just one three-year period, the <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent> 
firm sold more than $50 million of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> bonds to <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
investors. 'Bert' Walker was <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking</ent>'s president, and the firm 
was located in the offices of <ent type='ORG'>Averill <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent></ent>'s company at 39 
Broadway in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>. </p>

<p> "In 1926 Bert Walker did a favor for his new son-in-law, Prescott 
Bush. It was the sort of favor families do to help their children 
make a start in life, but Prescott came to regret it bitterly. 
Walker made Prescott vice president of W. A. <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent>. The problem 
was that Walker's specialty was companies that traded with <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>. 
As <ent type='ORG'>Thyssen</ent> and the other <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> industrialists consolidated Hitler's 
political power in the 1930s, an <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n financial connection was 
needed. According to our sources, <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking</ent> became an out-and-
out <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> money-laundering machine. . . . </p>

<p> "In [1931], <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent> &amp; Company merged with a <ent type='NORP'>British</ent>-<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
investment company to become <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent>. Prescott Bush 
became one of the senior partners of the new company, which 
relocated to 59 Broadway, while <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking</ent> remained at 39 
Broadway. But in 1934 Walker arranged to put his son-in-law on the 
board of directors of <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking</ent>. </p>

<p> "Walker also set up a deal to take over the North <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
operations of the <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Amerika Line</ent>, a cover for I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>'s 
<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> espionage unit in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>. The shipping line smuggled 
in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> agents, propaganda, and money for bribing <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n 
politicians to see things Hitler's way. The holding company was 
Walker's <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Shipping &amp; <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent>, which shared the offices at 
39 Broadway with <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking</ent>. In an elaborate corporate paper 
trail, <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent>'s stock in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Shipping &amp; <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent> was 
controlled by yet another holding company, the <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent> Fifteen 
Corporation, run out of Walker's office. The directors of this 
company were <ent type='ORG'>Averill <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent></ent>, Bert Walker, and Prescott Bush. . . . </p>

<p> ". . . In a November 1935 article in Common Sense, retired marine 
general <ent type='ORG'>Smedley</ent> D. Butler blamed <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent> for having 
the U.S. marines act like 'racketeers' and 'gangsters' in order to 
exploit financially the peasants of <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>. . . . </p>

<p> ". . . A 1934 congressional investigation alleged that Walker's 
'<ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Amerika Line</ent> subsidized a wide range of pro-<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> propaganda 
efforts both in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>.' Walker did not know 
it, but one of his <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n employees, Dan Harkins, had blown the 
whistle on the spy apparatus to <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>. Harkins, one of our best 
sources, became Roosevelt's first double agent . . . [and] kept up 
the pretense of being an ardent <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> sympathizer, while reporting to 
<ent type='ORG'>Naval Intelligence</ent> on the shipping company's deals with <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> 
intelligence.</p>

<p> "Instead of divesting the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> money," continue the authors, "Bush 
hired a lawyer to hide the assets. The lawyer he hired had 
considerable expertise in such underhanded schemes. It was Allen 
<ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>. According to <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s client list at Sullivan &amp; <ent type='ORG'>Cromwell</ent>, 
his first relationship with <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent> was on June 18, 
1936. In January 1937 <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> listed his work for the firm as 
'Disposal of Stan [<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent>] Investing stock.' </p>

<p> "As discussed in Chapter 3, <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> Oil</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent></ent> had 
completed a major stock transaction with <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> client, I.G. 
<ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>. By the end of January 1937 <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> had merged all his 
cloaking activities into one client account: '<ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent> 
<ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent>-Schroeder Rock.' Schroeder, of course, was the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> bank on 
whose board <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> sat. The 'Rock' were the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s of <ent type='ORG'>Standard</ent> 
Oil, who were already coming under scrutiny for their <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> deals. By 
May 1939 <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> handled another problem for <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent>, 
<ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent>, their '<ent type='ORG'>Securities Custodian Accounts</ent>.' </p>

<p> "If <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> was trying to conceal how many <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> holding companies 
<ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent> was connected with, he did not do a very 
good job. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, word leaked from <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> 
that affiliates of Prescott Bush's company were under investigation 
for aiding the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s</ent> in time of war. . . . </p>

<p> ". . . The government investigation against Prescott Bush 
continued. Just before the storm broke, his son, George, abandoned 
his plans to enter <ent type='ORG'>Yale</ent> and enlisted in the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent>. It was, say 
our sources among the former intelligence officers, a valiant 
attempt by an eighteen-year-old boy to save the family's honor. </p>

<p> "Young George was in flight school in October 1942, when the U.S. 
government charged his father with running <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> front groups in the 
<ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent>. Under the Trading with the Enemy Act, all the shares 
of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking</ent> Corporation</ent> were seized, including those held 
by Prescott Bush as being in effect held for enemy nationals. Union 
Banking, of course, was an affiliate of <ent type='ORG'>Brown Brothers</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent>, 
and Bush handled the <ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent>s' investments as well. </p>

<p> "Once the government had its hands on Bush's books, the whole story 
of the intricate web of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> front corporations began to unravel. A 
few days later two of <ent type='ORG'>Union Banking</ent>'s subsidiaries -- the <ent type='GPE'>Holland</ent> 
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Trading Corporation and the Seamless Steel Equipment 
Corporation -- also were seized. Then the government went after the 
<ent type='ORG'>Harriman</ent> Fifteen Holding Company, which Bush shared with his father-
in-law, Bert Walker, the <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>Amerika Line</ent>, and the <ent type='NORP'>Silesian</ent>-
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n Corporation. The U.S. government found that huge sections 
of Prescott Bush's empire had been operated on behalf of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> 
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> and had greatly assisted the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> war effort." (1)</p>

<p> EDWIN PAULEY</p>

<p> "Try as he did," continue the authors, "George Bush could not get 
away from <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s crooked corporate network, which his grandfather 
and father had joined in the 1920s. Wherever he turned, George found 
that the influence of the <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> brothers was already there. Even 
when he fled to <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> to become a successful businessman on his own, 
he ran into the pirates of Wall Street. </p>

<p> "One of Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s secret spies inside <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>ic party</ent> 
later became George Bush's partner in the <ent type='NORP'>Mexican</ent> oil business. 
Edwin Pauley, a <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> oil man, was . . . one of <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s covert 
agents in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations . . . a 'big 
business' <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>. . . ."</p>

<p> Among the key posts held by Pauley were: treasurer of the 
<ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>ic <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>al Committee, director of the <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>ic convention 
in 1944 and, after Truman's election, Truman appointed him the 
"Petroleum Coordinator of Lend-Lease Supplies for the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union 
and <ent type='GPE'>Britain</ent>." </p>

<p> Just after the end of World War II, "in April 1945 Truman appointed 
Pauley as the U.S. representative to the <ent type='ORG'>Allied</ent> Reparations 
Committee, with the rank of ambassador," as well as "industrial and 
commercial advisor to <ent type='ORG'>the Potsdam Conference</ent>, 'where his chief task 
was to renegotiate the reparations agreements formulated at <ent type='GPE'>Yalta</ent>.' 
As one historian noted, the 'oil industry has always watched 
reparations activities carefully.' There was a lot of money 
involved, and much of it belonged to the <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> brothers' clients." </p>

<p> At the same time, report <ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent> and Aarons,</p>

<p> "the <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> brothers were still shifting <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> assets out of <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> 
for their clients as well as for their own profit. They didn't want 
the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>s</ent> to get their hands on these assets or even know that 
they existed. Pauley played a significant role in solving this 
problem for the <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> brothers. The major part of <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>'s 
industrial assets was located in the zones occupied by the <ent type='ORG'>West</ent>'s 
forces. As <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>'s man on the ground, Pauley managed to deceive 
the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>s</ent> for long enough to allow Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> to spirit much of 
the remaining <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> assets out to safety. . . . </p>

<p> "Pauley, a key player in the plan to hide the <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> brothers' <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> 
assets, then moved into another post where he could help them 
further. After successfully keeping <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> assets in <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> hands, 
Pauley was given the job of 'surveying <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent>'s assets and 
determining the amount of its war debt.' Again, it was another job 
that was crucial to the <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> clique's secret financial and 
intelligence operations." (2)</p>

<p> After Pauley retired from government work he went back to being an 
independent oil man. <ent type='ORG'>Loftus</ent> and Aarons state that: "In 1958 he 
founded <ent type='ORG'>Pauley Petroleum</ent> which: . . . teamed up with Howard <ent type='ORG'>Hughes</ent> 
to expand oil production in the Gulf of <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>.</p>

<p> "<ent type='ORG'>Pauley Petroleum</ent> discovered a highly productive offshore petroleum 
reserve and in 1959 became involved in a dispute with the <ent type='NORP'>Mexican</ent> 
Government, which considered the royalties from the wells to be too 
low. </p>

<p> "According to our sources in the intelligence community, the oil 
dispute was really a shakedown of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> by <ent type='NORP'>Mexican</ent> politicians. 
<ent type='ORG'>Hughes</ent> and Pauley were working for the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> from time to time, while 
advancing their own financial interests in the lucrative <ent type='NORP'>Mexican</ent> oil 
fields. Pauley, say several of our sources, was the man who invented 
an intelligence money-laundering system in <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>, which was later 
refined in the 1970s as part of Nixon's Watergate scandal. At one 
point <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agents used <ent type='ORG'>Pemex</ent>, the <ent type='NORP'>Mexican</ent> government's oil monopoly, 
as a business cover at the same time <ent type='ORG'>Pemex</ent> was being used as a money 
laundry for Pauley's campaign contributions. As we shall see, the 
<ent type='NORP'>Mexican</ent>-<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> connection played an important part in the development 
of George Bush's political and intelligence career. . . .</p>

<p> "Pauley, say the 'old spies,' was the man who brought all the 
threads of the <ent type='NORP'>Mexican</ent> connection together. He was Bush's business 
associate, a front man for <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> [Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> was <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> 
director then], and originator of the use of <ent type='NORP'>Mexican</ent> oil fronts to 
create a slush fund for Richard Nixon's various campaigns. . . . </p>

<p> "Although it is not widely known, Pauley, in fact, had been a 
committed, if 'secret,' Nixon supporter since 1960. It should be 
recalled that Nixon tried to conceal his <ent type='NORP'>Mexican</ent> slush fund during 
the Watergate affair by pressuring the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> into a 'national 
security' cover-up. The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, to its credit, declined to participate. 
Unfortunately, others were so enmeshed in Pauley's work for Nixon 
that they could never extricate themselves. According to a number of 
our intelligence sources, the deals Bush cut with Pauley in <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent> 
catapulted him into political life. In 1960 Bush became a protege of 
Richard Nixon, who was then running for president of the United 
<ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s. . . . </p>

<p> "The most intriguing of Bush's early connections was to Richard 
Nixon, who as vice president had supervised Allen <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s covert 
planning for <ent type='ORG'>the Bay of Pigs</ent> [invasion]. For years it has been 
rumored that <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s client, George Bush's father, was one of the 
<ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> leaders who recruited Nixon to run for <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and later 
convinced Eisenhower to take him on as vice president. There is no 
doubt that the two families were close. George Bush described Nixon 
as his 'mentor.' Nixon was a Bush supporter in his very first tilt 
at politics, during his unsuccessful run for the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> in 1964, and 
turned out again when he entered the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> two years later. </p>

<p> "After Nixon's landslide victory in 1972, he ordered a general 
house cleaning on the basis of loyalty. 'Eliminate everyone,' he 
told John Ehrlichman about reappointments, 'except George Bush. Bush 
will do anything for our cause.' . . . According to Bush's account, 
the president told him that 'the place I really need you is over at 
the <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>al Committee running things.' So, in 1972, Nixon appointed 
George Bush as head of the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>al Committee. </p>

<p> "It was Bush who fulfilled Nixon's promise to make the 'ethnic' 
emigres a permanent part of <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> politics. In 1972 Nixon's 
<ent type='ORG'>State</ent> Department spokesman confirmed to his <ent type='NORP'>Australian</ent> counterpart 
that the ethnic groups were very useful to get out the vote in 
several key states. Bush's tenure as head of the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Nation</ent>al 
Committee exactly coincided with Laszlo <ent type='ORG'>Pasztor</ent>'s 1972 drive to 
transform <ent type='ORG'>the Heritage Groups Council</ent> into the party's official 
ethnic arm. The groups <ent type='ORG'>Pasztor</ent> chose as Bush's campaign allies were 
the emigre <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>s whom <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent> had brought to <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s</ent></ent>. . 
. . </p>

<p> ". . . Nearly twenty years later, and after expose's in several 
respectable newspapers, Bush continued to recruit most of the same 
ethnic <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>s, including <ent type='ORG'>Pasztor</ent>, for his own 1988 ethnic outreach 
program when he first ran for president. </p>

<p> "According to our sources in the intelligence community," state the 
authors, "it was Bush who told Nixon that the Watergate 
investigations might start uncovering the <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> skeletons in the 
<ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> party's closet. Bush himself acknowledges that he wrote 
Nixon a letter asking him to step down. The day after Bush did so, 
Nixon resigned. </p>

<p> "Bush had hoped to become Gerald <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent>'s vice president upon Nixon's 
resignation, but he was appointed U.S. ambassador to the <ent type='ORG'>UN</ent>. Nelson 
<ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> became vice president and chief damage controller. He 
formed a special commission in an attempt to preempt the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent>'s 
investigation of the intelligence community. The <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> 
Commission into <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> abuses was filled with old <ent type='ORG'>OPC</ent> [<ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s Office 
of Policy Coordination] hands like Ronald Reagan, who had been the 
front man back in the 1950s for the money-laundering organization, 
the Crusade for Freedom, which was part of <ent type='GPE'>Dulles</ent>'s <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent> 'freedom 
fighters' program." (3)</p>

<p> In 1988, <ent type='ORG'>Project Censored</ent>, a news media censorship research 
organization, awarded the honor of "Top Censored story" to the 
subject of George Bush. The article revealed "how the major mass 
media ignored, overlooked or undercovered at least ten critical 
stories reported in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s alternative press that raised serious 
questions about the <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> candidate, George Bush, dating from 
his reported role as a <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> 'asset' in 1963 to his Presidential 
campaign's connection with a network of anti-<ent type='NORP'>Semites</ent> with <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> and 
fascist affiliations in 1988." (4) </p>

<p> If, before you finished reading this publication, you ever wondered 
why the U.S. federal government refuses to consider the medicinal 
and industrial value of cannabis hemp, despite widespread and 
growing support from the public, medical experts, industry leaders, 
and a growing number of state legislators across this nation . . . 
you now have the answer. </p>

<p> For the past several generations, <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent> have been 
systematically deceived about the true nature of cannabis hemp. Many 
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>ns</ent> have died - victims of political murders. Millions have 
been imprisoned, their children and their property taken away, their 
futures destroyed. The history of my own state - <ent type='GPE'>Kentucky</ent> - and 
others as well, have been "sanitized," rewritten, our heritage 
deleted, our citizens defrauded and impoverished to bury the truth. </p>

<p> And if, before you finished reading this publication, you ever 
wondered why the U.S. federal government would train and finance 
<ent type='ORG'>Central</ent> <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n death squads; or why, while waging the so-called 
"war on drugs," the U.S. federal government would operate cocaine 
and heroin smuggling operations around the world, bringing in tons 
of drugs to places like <ent type='ORG'>Mena</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent>; or why the U.S. federal 
government would "spread democracy" throughout the world by 
assassinating democratically elected politicians - both at home and 
abroad - replacing them with right-wing dictators and training their 
secret police in the latest techniques of torture, terrorism, and 
mind control; or why the U.S. federal government would conduct 
deadly medical and radiation experiments on unsuspecting citizens - 
including pregnant women, the mentally impaired, and children . . . 
you now have the answer. </p>

<p> The last question is "what are we going to do about it?" </p>
