<p>(EDITOR'S NOTE:  A NATIONAL PANEL OF MEDIA EXPERTS ANNUALLY SELECTS
THE TOP TEN UNDER-REPORTED NEWS STORIES OF THE YEAR)</p>

<p>PERSONAL HARASSMENT AND ADMINISTRATION CENSORSHIP
TOP UNDER-REPORTED NEWS STORIES OF 1986</p>

<p>ROHNERT <ent type='GPE'>PARK</ent> -- The official harassment of U.S. citizens
opposed to the Reagan administration's <ent type='LOC'>Central <ent type='GPE'>America</ent></ent> policies topped
the list of 25 overlooked news stories of 1986 according to a national
panel of media experts.</p>

<p>The second most undercovered story of the year, cited by
<ent type='ORG'>Project Censored</ent>, warned of the growth of information control in the
<ent type='GPE'>United States</ent> including censorship, disinformation, and a new, broader
classification category.</p>

<p>Now in its 11th year, <ent type='ORG'>Project Censored</ent>, a national media
research effort conducted annually at <ent type='ORG'>Sonoma State University</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>California</ent>, locates stories about significant issues which are not
widely publicized by the national news media.</p>

<p>Following are the top ten under-reported news stories of 1986
as announced by project director Carl Jensen, professor of
communication studies at <ent type='ORG'>Sonoma State University</ent>:</p>

<p>1.Criticizing <ent type='LOC'>Central <ent type='GPE'>America</ent></ent> Policies Can Be Dangerous.
Political opponents of the Reagan administration's <ent type='LOC'>Central <ent type='GPE'>America</ent></ent>
policies were the targets of mysterious break-ins, Internal Revenue
Service audits, and <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> surveillance and interrogation. <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>man
Don Edwards (D-<ent type='GPE'>CA</ent>), a former <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent></p>

<p>agent, warned that the administration may be "using the various
independent agencies of <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent> government for their
political purposes."</p>

<p>2.<ent type='ORG'>Official Information Control</ent> . The <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> Library
Association documented Reagan administration efforts to eliminate,
restrict, and privatize government documents; in 1986 the government
officially launched a new "disinformation" program which permits it to
release deliberately false, incomplete, and misleading information; it
also developed a new category of "sensitive information" which
restricts public access to a broad range of previously unclassified
data.</p>

<p>3.Personal Privacy Lost.In 1986 the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> was given
extra- ordinary powers to look into private financial and telephonic
files of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> citizens "suspected of being in the employ of a
foreign power." The Intelligence Authorization Bill also permits the
<ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> to share such information with any other government agency, such
as the <ent type='ORG'>IRS</ent>, which has a relevant interest in it.</p>

<p>4.<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> Paid for <ent type='ORG'>Pro <ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent> Media Coverage</ent>.  Edgar
Chamorro, former head of <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> communications in <ent type='LOC'>Central <ent type='GPE'>America</ent></ent>,
testified that "approximately 15 <ent type='NORP'>Honduran</ent> journalists and broadcasters
were on the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> payroll" and that <ent type='NORP'>contra</ent> influence extended to every
major <ent type='NORP'>Honduran</ent> newspaper and television station. Carlos Morales, a
<ent type='NORP'>Costa Rican</ent> professor of journalism, reported that at least eight
<ent type='NORP'>Costa Rican</ent> journalists, including three "top editors," received
monthly payments from the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.</p>

<p>5.President Reagan and the World Anti-Communist League.
According to investigators, the World Anti-Communist League (<ent type='NORP'>WACL</ent>), an
international right-wing group, is so extreme that the John Birch
Society has shunned it and advises its members to do likewise. Yet
President Reagan sent its U.S. leader, retired U.S. Major General John
Singlaub, a letter congratulating the <ent type='NORP'>WACL</ent> on its "leadership role"
and "best wishes for every future success."</p>

<p>6.<ent type='ORG'>Nerve Gas Production</ent> in Residential Areas.  Although
the military has been under orders from <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> since 1984 to dispose
of nerve gases by 1994, nerve gases are currently being manufactured
and tested in 46 U.S. communities, in 26 states across the country,
usually without the knowledge of the local residents.</p>

<p>7.<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent>gate</ent>: The Untold Story.  Affidavits submitted in
a $17 million lawsuit filed last year by <ent type='ORG'>the Christic Institute</ent> reveal
that for a quarter of a century, a secret team of official and retired
U.S. military and <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> officials has trafficked in drugs, assassinated
political enemies, stolen from the U.S.  government, armed terrorists,
and subverted the will of <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and the public with hundreds of
millions of drug dollars at their disposal. Defendants in the suit
include retired Major Generals Richard Secord and John Singlaub, and
businessman Albert Hakim.</p>

<p>8.Federal Radiation Tests on <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent>s. Human radiation
tests, reminiscent of the heinous experiments conducted by the <ent type='NORP'>Nazis</ent>
and <ent type='NORP'>Japanese</ent> during World War II, were conducted from the mid-1940's
until the 1970's by official U.S. federal agencies and prestigious
academic and medical institutions; they were revealed last October.</p>

<p>9.Veterans' Administration Destroys Evidence. In August,
1986, the Veterans' Administration was caught shredding thousands of
case records of contested radiation injury claims filed by military
personnel who had been exposed to nuclear radiation since the 1940's.</p>

<p>10.The Lethal Shuttle: Plutonium Payload Scheduled. The
space shuttle scheduled to follow the tragic Challenger launch last
year would have carried 46.7 pounds of toxic plutonium-238.  A leading
scientist warned that the plutonium, if dispersed in fine pieces by an
exlosion, would release more plutonium radioactivity than the combined
fallout from all nuclear weapons tests of the U.S., <ent type='GPE'>the Soviet Union</ent>,
and the <ent type='GPE'>United Kingdom</ent>.  Despite the global risks involved, <ent type='ORG'>NASA</ent> plans
to go ahead with plutonium-fueled space probes when shuttle missions
start again.</p>

<p>The other 15 under-reported stories of 1986 were: The Unknown
War in <ent type='GPE'>West Papua</ent>, The Forgotten War in <ent type='GPE'>El Salvador</ent>, Senator Jesse
Helms' Military Coup in <ent type='GPE'>Argentina</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>US Air Force Toxic Waste Scandal</ent> In

Breakthrough in Animal Cloning, Feldene: The Deadly Anti-inflammatory

Murders of Black Children In <ent type='GPE'>Atlanta</ent>, The Plowshares Movement:

<p>PROJECT CENSORED JUDGES

<ent type='GPE'>California</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Berkeley</ent>; Noam Chomsky, professor, Linguistics and

<ent type='ORG'>Gannett Center for Media Studies</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Columbia University</ent>; Dr. George
Gerbner, Dean, Annenberg School of Communications, University of

Professor of Communication, University of <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>, San Diego.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Sonoma State University</ent> student researchers participating in
the nationwide research effort were Peggy Sue Alberhasky, Sarah
Alcorn, Larry Crowell, Daren Decker, Dave Hoffman, Mike Jasper, Karen
Kitchens, Tom Montan, Laura Moore, Nancy Neilson, Bebe O'Brien, and
Bruce Schwank. Kathy Wolff, a project researcher in 1986, was
assistant project director.</p>

<p>Dr. Jensen, who originated the media research project in 1976,
said "The most serious warning in this year's results is the
administration's systematic assault on our free flow of information.
<ent type='ORG'>The <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n</ent> Library Association</ent> has published a 33-page document
which lists page after page of specific efforts by the Reagan
administration to restrict government information.  Recently, the
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press issued a summary of
actions by the Reagan administration to restrict public and media
access to government information which includes 135 such actions. The
Reagan administration's efforts at information control are serious and
deserve as least as much media attention as that given the peccadillos
of Gary Hart and Jim Bakker."</p>
