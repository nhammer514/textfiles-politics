<p>Skolnick COMMENTARY #023
========================</p>

<p>[<ent type='ORG'>CfD</ent> Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve 
either all or portions of the following.]</p>

<p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put 
out by a group in <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up 
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>

<p>Hi! Sherman Skolnick, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts 
[<ent type='ORG'>CCCC</ent>], 9800 Oglesby.</p>

<p>A big cover-up with congressman Dan Rostenkowski of <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>, 
arranged by the corrupt <ent type='ORG'>IRS</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>the Justice Department</ent>, and the 
White House.</p>

<p>Clinton, while Governor, supervised a <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> operation in a forest 
in western <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent> called the Mena airport. It was used for dope 
and gun smuggling on a mass scale. Implicated also were George 
Bush as vice-President and Reagan as President, and Ollie North.</p>

<p>Governor Clinton told the state law enforcement to "look the 
other way." Used were several public and private funds, including 
the <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent> Development Finance Authority, Jackson Stephens and 
his bond brokerage and banking empire. Also reportedly used: A 
company called Park-O-Meter.</p>

<p>The hundreds of millions of dollars per month from cocaine and 
such was reportedly funneled through <ent type='ORG'>Garfield Ridge Trust</ent> and 
Savings Bank of <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>. The bank has been owned and operated by 
congressman Rostenkowski and his cronies, who have commented on 
the bank's reported criminality for some 20 years now.</p>

<p>&gt;From the bank, the money was washed through the commodity, 
currency, and options markets here: The <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> Board of Trade, 
the <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> Mercantile Exchange, and the <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> Board Options 
Exchange. (Traders on these markets have told us that they expect 
a scandal. And the <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> <ent type='ORG'>IRS</ent> "torpedoed" their own 
investigation of this.)</p>

<p>Over the years, "<ent type='ORG'>Rosty</ent>" (as the congressman has been called) has 
received bribes of tens of thousands of dollars from these 
markets. Some bribes they attempted to disguise as so-called 
"lecture fees." Did "<ent type='ORG'>Rosty</ent>" ever give some of these speeches for 
them, huh?</p>

<p>As head of the tax writing committee of <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, "<ent type='ORG'>Rosty</ent>" put 
through laws so quietly they were considered private laws; making 
the speculators here exempt from paying taxes on little-known 
market devices such as "hedges" and "straddles." And, of course, 
the crooked <ent type='ORG'>IRS</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> received part of the bribes to cover 
this all up.</p>

<p>"<ent type='ORG'>Rosty</ent>'s" two daughters reportedly worked at <ent type='ORG'>the Board of Trade</ent> 
(Oh yeah?) but were seldom seen there. They reportedly 
facilitated the cocaine money laundering.</p>

<p>"<ent type='ORG'>Rosty</ent>" was also one of the main culprits regarding the bribery 
of <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> by <ent type='ORG'>the Bank of Credit and Commerce International</ent> 
[<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>]. This criminal bank supposedly went under in 1991, *but* 
it continues, however, as <ent type='ORG'>Chemical Bank Group</ent> -- successor to 
<ent type='ORG'>First National Bank</ent> of <ent type='NORP'>Cicero</ent>, run by Paul Marcinkas, the 
gangster who headed <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican Bank</ent>.</p>

<p>Using "cook books" for <ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>, the commodity, currency, and options 
markets here bought 25% of <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> -- *including* congressman 
Rostenkowski and Company.</p>

<p>The crooked mastermind of "<ent type='ORG'>Rosty</ent>'s" election campaign in 1994 has 
been Jeremiah Joyce, a little-known business partner of <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> 
mayor Richie Daley. Joyce, and Daley, are the secret owners of 
<ent type='ORG'>Glenrock Company</ent>, construction supplies. By the way, if you want 
to be a state highway contractor, you'd better get your cement- 
pouring compounds from them! And, you'd better pay "kickbacks." 
<ent type='ORG'>Glenrock Company</ent> reportedly does not keep proper records for the 
<ent type='ORG'>IRS</ent>!</p>

<p>"<ent type='ORG'>Rosty</ent>" is willing to "take the fall" on relatively minor charges 
[in order] to continue the mass media cover-up of Mena airport, 
cocaine and guns, his crooked bank, the big dealers in the 
<ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> markets, and the corrupt tax collectors in the White 
House and <ent type='ORG'>the Justice Department</ent>.</p>

<p>(By the way, if he doesn't "stay shut," I suppose they'd shoot 
him.)</p>

<p>They'd need a very large jail cell for Rostenkowski, and his pal 
Richie Daley, Bill and Hillary Clinton, the head of the <ent type='ORG'>IRS</ent> in 
<ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>, the U.S. attorney general, and the pilots on the markets 
here!</p>

<p>Just another story, suppressed by the liars and whores of the 
press.</p>
