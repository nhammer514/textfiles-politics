DeMohrenschildt told a hospital roommate just before his death, 
were together watching the parade when the shots were fired --

saw him.</p>

<p>Some Nagging Doubts
 
Nixon, having attended a convention of Pepsi-Cola executives in

another city for several days to avoid threats by those who might 
think he was involved. DeMohrenschildt, in <ent type='GPE'>Haiti</ent>, expresses belief 
Oswald was a patsy and that the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> killed Kennedy (though later

Oswald in a right-wing plot to kill JFK). Ferrie allegedly flies 
to <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> on evening after assassination but his actual

kidnapped soon afterward to distract attention from the 
assassination.  Frank Sinatra, Jr., kidnapped, released unharmed.</p>
