   SECRET CONCENTRATION CAMPS
 
 The September issue of <ent type='ORG'>THE OSTRICH</ent> reprinted a story from the
 <ent type='ORG'>CBA</ent> BULLETIN which listed the following principal civilian <ent type='ORG'>concentra</ent>-
 tion camps established in <ent type='ORG'>GULAG USA</ent> under the =<ent type='ORG'>Rex</ent> '84= program:
 Ft. Chaffee, <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent>; Ft. Drum, <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>; Ft. Indian Gap, <ent type='GPE'>Penn</ent>-

 Krome, <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>.  The February OSTRICH printed a map of the expanding
 <ent type='ORG'>Gulag</ent>.  <ent type='GPE'>Alhough</ent> this listing and map stirred considerable interest,
 the report was not new.  For at least 20 years, knowledgeable <ent type='ORG'>Patriots</ent>
 have been warning of these sinister plots to incarcerate dissidents
 opposing plans of the =<ent type='ORG'>Elitist Syndicate</ent>= for a totalitarian
 =New World Order=.  Indeed, the plot was recognized with the insidious
 encroachment of "regionalism" back in the 1960's.  As early as 1968,
 the "greatest land steal in history" leading to global corporate
 socialism, was in a ="Master Land Plan"= for <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>
 by =<ent type='ORG'>Executive Orders</ent>= involving water resource regions, 
 population movement and control, pollution control, zoning
 and land use, navigation and environmental bills, etc.  Indeed,
 the real undercover aim of the so-called "Environmental Rennaissance"
 has been the abolition of private property.
 All prelude to the total grab of the =<ent type='ORG'>World Conservation Bank</ent>=,
 as <ent type='ORG'>THE OSTRICH</ent> has been reporting.  The map on this page and
 the list of executive orders available for imposition of an "emergency"
 are from 1970s files of the late Gen. =P. A. <ent type='ORG'>Del Valle</ent>'s= <ent type='ORG'>ALERT</ent>,

  international tension or financial crisis".  He is also to
  perform such additional functions as the President
  may direct.

   A Dangerous Fact Not Generally Known
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS GROSSLY AND FLAGRANTLY VIOLATE ARTICLE
   4 SECTION 4 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF <ent type='GPE'>THE UNITED STATES</ent>.  "THE
   UNITED STATES SHALL GUARANTEE TO EVERY STATE IN THIS UNION A
   REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT, AND SHALL PROTECT EACH OF THEM
   AGAINST INVASION; AND ON APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE, OR OF THE
   EXECUTIVE (WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT BE CONVENED) AGAINST
   DOMESTIC VIOLENCE."  "REGIONAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT A REPRESENTATIVE
   REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT!"

   When Government gets out of hand and can no longer be controlled
   by the people, short of violent overthrow as in 1776, there are
   two sources of power which are used by the dictatorial government
   to keep the people in line:  <ent type='ORG'>the Police Power</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>the Power</ent> of the
   Purse (through which the necessities of life can be withheld).
   And both of these powers are no longer balanced between the three
   Federal Branches, and between the Federal and the <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> and
   local Governments.  These powers have been taken over, with the
   permission of <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Legislature</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> Governments,
   by <ent type='ORG'>the Executive Branch</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Government</ent> and all attempts
   to reclaim that lost power have been defeated.

   <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>d simply:  the dictatorial power of the <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> rests primarily
   on three basis:  <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Order 11490, <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Order 11647, and
   <ent type='ORG'>the Planning</ent>, Programming, Budgeting System which is operated
   through the new and all-powerful Office of Management and
   Budget.

 E. O. 11490 is a compilation of some 23 previous <ent type='ORG'>Executive Orders</ent>,
   signed by Nixon on Oct. 28, 1969, and outlining emergency functions
   which are to be performed by some 28 <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Departments and
   Agencies whenever the President of <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> declares
   a national emergency (as in defiance of an impeachment edict,
   for example).  Under the terms of E. O. 11490, the President
   can declare that a national emergency exists and the <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent>
   Branch can:
   * Take over all communications media
   * Seize all sources of power
   * Take charge of all food resources
   * Control all highways and seaports
   * Seize all railroads, inland waterways, airports, storage facilities
   * Commandeer all civilians to work under federal supervision
   * Control all activities relating to health, education, and welfare
   * Shift any segment of the population from one locality to another
   * Take over farms, ranches, timberized properties
   * Regulate the amount of your own money you may withdraw from
 your bank, or savings and loan institution

   All of these and many more items are listed in 32 pages incorporating
   nearly 200000 words, providing and absolute bureaucratic
   dictatorship whenever the President gives the word.

--&gt;  <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Order 11647 provides the regional and local mechanisms
--&gt;  and manpower for carrying out the provisions of E. O. 11490.
--&gt;  Signed by Richard Nixon on Feb. 10, 1972, this Order sets up Ten 
--&gt;  <ent type='ORG'>Federal Regional Councils</ent> to govern <ent type='ORG'>Ten Federal Regions</ent> made up
--&gt;  of the fifty still existing <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s of the Union.

  A war, even the most victorious, is a national misfortune.
   --Helmuth Von Moltke, <ent type='NORP'>Prussian</ent> field marshall

 George Bush put <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> on the road to its second war in
  two years by declaring a national emergency on August 21990.  In
  response to <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>'s invasion of <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>, Bush issued two <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent>
  Orders (12722 and 12723) which restricted trade and travel with <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>
  and froze <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>i and <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>i assets within the U.S. and those in the
  possession of U.S. persons abroad.  At least 15 other executive orders
  followed these initial restrictions and enabled the President to
  mobilize the country's human and productive resources for war.  Under
  the national emergency, Bush was able unilaterally to break his 1991
  budget agreement with <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> which had frozen defense spending, to
  entrench further the U.S. economy in the mire of the military-
  industrial complex, to override environmental protection regulations,
  and to make free enterprise and civil liberties conditional upon an
  executive determination of national security interests.

  The <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> of Emergency
 In time of war a president's power derives from both constitutional
  and statutory sources.  Under Article II, Section 2 of the
  Constitution, he is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.  Although
  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> alone retains the right to declare war, this power has become
  increasingly meaningless in the face of a succession of unilateral
  decisions by the executive to mount invasions.
 The president's statutory authority, granted by <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and
  expanded by it under the 1988 National Emergencies Act (50 <ent type='ORG'>USC</ent> sec.
  1601), confers special powers in time of war or national emergency.
  He can invoke those special powers simply by declaring a national
  emergency.  First, however, he must specify the legal provisions under
  which he proposes that he, or other officers, will act.  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> may
  end a national emergency by enacting a joint resolution.  Once invoked
  by the president, emergency powers are directed by the National
  Security Council and administered, where appropriate, under the
  general umbrella of <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Emergency Management Agency</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>).[1]
  There is no requirement that <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> be consulted before an emergency
  is declared or findings signed.  The only restriction on Bush is that
  he must inform <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> in a "timely" fashion--he being the sole
  arbiter of timeliness.
 Ultimately, the president's perception of the severity of a
  particular threat to national security and the integrity of his
  appointed officers determine the nature of any state of emergency.
  For this reason, those who were aware of the modern development of
  presidential emergency powers were apprehensive about the domestic
  ramifications of any national emergency declared by George Bush.  In
  light of Bush's record (see "Bush Chips Away at Constitution" Box
  below) and present performance, their fears appear well-founded.

  The War at Home
 It is too early to know all of the emergency powers, executive
  orders and findings issued under classified National Security
  Directives[2] implemented by Bush in the name of the Gulf War.  In
  addition to the emergency powers necessary to the direct mobilization
  of active and reserve armed forces of <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>, there are
  some 120 additional emergency powers that can be used in a national
  emergency or state of war (declared or undeclared by <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>).  The
  "<ent type='ORG'>Federal Register</ent>" records some 15 <ent type='ORG'>Executive Orders</ent> (EO) signed by
  Bush from August 21990 to February 141991.  (See "Bush's <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent>
  Orders" box, below)
 It may take many years before most of the executive findings and
  use of powers come to light, if indeed they ever do.  But evidence is
  emerging that at least some of Bush's emergency powers were activated
  in secret.  Although only five of the 15 EOs that were published were
  directed at non-military personnel, the costs directly attributable to
  the exercise of the authorities conferred by the declaration of
  national emergency from August 2, 1990 to February 1, 1991 for non-
  military activities are estimated at approximately $1.3 billion.
  According to a February 11, 1991 letter from Bush to congressional
  leaders reporting on the "<ent type='ORG'>National Emergency With Respect</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>,"
  these costs represent wage and salary costs for <ent type='ORG'>the Departments</ent> of
  Treasury, <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>, Agriculture, and Transportation, U.S. Customs,
  <ent type='ORG'>Federal Reserve Board</ent>, and <ent type='ORG'>the National Security Council</ent>.[3]
 The fact that $1.3 billion was spent in non-military salaries alone
  in this six month period suggests an unusual amount of government
  resources utilized to direct the national emergency state.  In
  contrast, government salaries for one year of the state of emergency
  with <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>[4] cost only $430000.

   |   Bush Chips Away at Constitution    |
   |      |
   |  George Bush, perhaps more than any other individual in  |
   | U.S. history, has expanded the emergency powers of   |
   | presidency.  In 1976, as Director of <ent type='ORG'>Central Intelligence</ent>,   |
   | he convened Team B, a group of rabidly anti-<ent type='NORP'>communist</ent>  |
   | intellectuals and former government officials to reevaluate  |
   | <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> inhouse intelligence estimates on <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> military  |
   | strength.  The resulting report recommended draconian civil  |
   | defense measures which led to President Ford's <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> |
   | Order 11921 authorizing plans to establish government  |
   | control of the means of production, distribution, energy |
   | sources, wages and salaries, credit and the flow of money  |
   | in U.S. financial institutions in a national emergency.[1]   |
   |  As Vice President, Bush headed <ent type='ORG'>the Task Force</ent> on  |
   | Combatting Terrorism, that recommended:  extended and  |
   | flexible emergency presidential powers to combat terrorism;  |
   | restrictions on congressional oversight in counter-    |
   | terrorist planning;  and curbing press coverage of   |
   | terrorist incidents.[2]  The report gave rise to the Anti-   |
   | Terrorism Act of 1986, that granted the President clear-cut  |
   | authority to respond to terrorism with all appropriate   |
   | means including deadly force.  It authorized the   |
   | <ent type='ORG'>Immigration and Naturalization Service</ent> to control and  |
   | remove not only alien terrorists but potential terrorist |
   | aliens and those "who are likely to be supportive of   |
   | terrorist activity within the U.S."[3]  The bill superceded  |
   | the War Powers Act by imposing no time limit on the    |
   | President's use of force in a terrorist situation, and   |
   | lifted the requirement that the President consult <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>   |
   | before sanctioning deadly force.   |
   |  From 1982 to 1988, Bush led the Defense Mobilization  |
   | Planning Systems <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>DMPSA</ent>), a secret government   |
   | organization, and spent more than $3 billion upgrading   |
   | command, control, and communications in <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent>'s continuity  |
   | of government infrastructures.  Continuity of Government |
   | (<ent type='ORG'>COG</ent>) was ostensibly created to assure government  |
   | functioning during war, especially nuclear war.  The <ent type='ORG'>Agency</ent>  |
   | was so secret that even many members of the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> were  |
   | unaware of its existence and most of its work was done   |
   | without congressional oversight.   |
   |  Project 908, as the <ent type='ORG'>DMPSA</ent> was sometimes called, was |
   | similar to its parent agency <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> in that it came under  |
   | investigation for mismanagement and contract   |
   | irregularities.[4]  During this same period, <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> had been   |
   | fraught with scandals including emergency planning with a  |
   | distinctly anti-constitutional flavor.  The agency would |
   | have sidestepped <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and other federal agencies and |
   | put the President and <ent type='ORG'>FEMA</ent> directly in charge of the U.S.  |
   | planning for martial rule.  Under this state, the executive  |
   | would take upon itself powers far beyond those necessary to  |
   | address national emergency contingencies.[5]   |
   |  Bush's "anything goes" anti-drug strategy, announced  |
   | on September 6, 1989, suggested that executive emergency |
   | powers be used:  to oust those suspected of associating  |
   | with drug users or sellers from public and private housing;  |
   | to mobilize <ent type='ORG'>the National Guard</ent> and U.S. military to fight  |
   | drugs in the continental U.S.;  to confiscate private  |
   | property belonging to drug users, and to incarcerate first   |
   | time offenders in work camps.[6]   |
   |  The record of Bush's fast and loose approach to   |
   | constitutionally guaranteed civil rights is a history of |
   | the erosion of liberty and the consolidation of an imperial  |
   | executive.       |
