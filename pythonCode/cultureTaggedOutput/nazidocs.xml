<xml><p>The following are excerpts from original <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> documents, relating
directly to the extermination of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> and others which was carried
out by the <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent>s during WW2. The purpose of this collection is both
to present such documents in an easily accessible form, and to
point out more complete references.</p>

<p>Naturally, in preparing a collection like this, one has to decide
which documents to use; the amount of material is enormous. I have
tried to choose a small set of representative ones, which touch
as many aspects as possible. Many of these documents are very long,
so I have restricted myself to short excerpts. </p>

Today I will once more be a prophet: If the international <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> financiers
in and outside <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> should succeed in plunging the nations once more into
a world war, then the result will not be the bolshevization of the earth,
and thus the victory of <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ry, but the annihilation of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> race in
<ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>!</p>

<p>Adolph Hitler speaking to a crowd at the Sports Palace in <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent>,
30 January 1942. Quoted in "The Holocaust", by Martin Gilbert,
Holt, Rinehart and Winston, NY, 1985, p. 285. Text as monitored by the 
Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service, Federal Communications Commission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
And we say that the war will not end as the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> imagine it
will, namely with the uprooting of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Aryan</ent>s</ent>, but the result of
this war will be the complete annihilation of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>.</p>

<p>Excerpts from the meeting between Hitler and the <ent type='ORG'>Mufti</ent>,
Haj Amin Husseini, on 28 November 1941. The notes were taken by
Dr. Paul Otto Schmidt and are quoted in <ent type='ORG'>Fleming</ent>'s "Hitler and the
Final Solution", p. 101-104. Also geheime <ent type='ORG'>Reichssache</ent> 57 a/41, Records 
Dept. Foreign and  <ent type='ORG'>Commonwealth Office</ent> Pa/2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Fuehrer then made the following declaration, requesting
the <ent type='ORG'>Mufti</ent> to lock it deep in his heart:</p>

<p>1) He (the Fuehrer) would carry on the fight until the last
 traces of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an hegemony had been
 obliterated.</p>

<p>2) In the course of this fight, the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> army would - at a
 time that could not yet be specified, but in any case in
 the clearly foreseeable future - gain the southern exit of
 <ent type='NORP'>Caucasus</ent>.</p>

<p>3) As soon as this breakthrough was made, the Fuehrer would
 offer the <ent type='NORP'>Arab</ent> world his personal assurance that the hour
 of liberation had struck. Thereafter, <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y's only
 remaining objective in the region would be limited to the
 annihilation of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> living under <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> protection
 in <ent type='NORP'>Arab</ent> lands.</p>

<p>Adolf Hitler, quoted in "Hitler", by Joachim Fest, Vintage
Books Edition, 1974, p. 679-680:
---------------------------------------------------------------
Nature is cruel; therefore we are also entitled to be cruel. When I
send the flower of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> youth into the steel hail of the next war
without feeling the slightest regret over the precious <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> blood
that is being spilled, should I not also have the right to eliminate
millions of an inferior race that multiplies like vermin?</p>

----------------------------------------------------------------------
I mean the evacuation of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>, the extermination of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent>
race. It's one of those things it is easy to talk about, "the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent>
race is being exterminated", says one party member, "that's quite
clear, it's in our program, elimination of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>, and we're doing
it, exterminating them". And then they come, 80 million worthy
<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>s, and each one has his decent <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>. Of course the others are
vermin, but this one is an A-1 <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>. Not one of those who talk this way
has watched it, not one of them has gone through it. Most of you know
what it means when 100 corpses are lying side by side, or 500, or
1000.  To have stuck it out and at the same time - apart from
exceptions caused by human weakness - to have remained decent fellows,
that is what has made us hard.  This is a page of glory in our history
which has never been written and is never to be written.</p>

<p>I ask of you that what I say in this circle you really only hear and
never speak of. We come to the question: how is it with the women and
the children? I have resolved even here on a completely clear
solution. That is to say I do not consider myself justified in
eradicating the men - so to speak killing or ordering them killed -
and allowing the avengers in the shape of the children to grow up for
our sons and grandsons. The difficult decision has to be taken, to
cause this Volk [people] to disappear from the earth.</p>

 archives in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, DC]</p>

We have - I would say, as very consistent <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>National Socialist</ent>s</ent>,
taken the question of blood as our starting point. We were the
first really to solve the problem of blood by action, and in
this connection, by problem of blood, we of course do not
mean antisemitism. Antisemitism is exactly the same as delousing.
Getting rid of lice is not a question of ideology. It is a 
matter of cleanliness.</p>

World <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ry will suffer a great catastrophe at the same time as
<ent type='NORP'>Bolshevism</ent>. The Fuehrer once more expressed his determination to
clean up the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> pitilessly. There must be no squeamish
sentimentalism about it. The <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> have deserved the catastrophe that
has now overtaken them. Their destruction will now go hand in hand
with the destruction of our enemies. We must hasten this process
with cold ruthlessness.</p>

[<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> occupied <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent>] are now being evacuated eastward. The procedure 
is a pretty barbaric one and not to be described here more definitely. 
Not much will remain of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>. On the whole it can be said that about 
60 per cent of them will have to be liquidated whereas only 40 per cent 
can be used for forced labor.</p>

In all these weeks, they [i.e., your families] will be thinking
of you, saying to themselves: my God, there he sits in
<ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent> where there are so many lice and <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>, perhaps he is
hungry and cold, perhaps he is afraid to write.
It would not be a bad idea to send our dear ones back home a
picture, and tell them: well now, there are not so many
lice and <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> any more, and conditions here in the General
Government have changed and improved somewhat already. Of
course, I could not eliminate all lice and <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> in only one
year's time. But in the course of time, and above all, if you
help me, this end will be attained. After all, it is not
necessary for us to accomplish everything within a year and
right away, for what would otherwise be left for those who
follow us to do?</p>

---------------------------------------------------------------
One way or another -- I will tell you quite openly -- we must finish 
off the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>. The Fuehrer put it into words once: should united <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ry
again succeed in setting off a world war, then the blood sacrifice
shall not be made only by the peoples driven into war, but then the
<ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent> of <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> will have met his end....</p>

<p>But what should be done with the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>? Can you believe that they will
be accommodated in settlements in the <ent type='GPE'>Ostland</ent>? In <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent> we were told:
why are you making all this trouble? We don't want them either, not in
<ent type='GPE'>Ostland</ent> nor in the <ent type='ORG'>Reichskommissariat</ent>; liquidate them yourselves!
Gentlemen, I must ask you to steel yourselves against all
considerations of compassion. We must destroy the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> wherever we
find them, and wherever it is at all possible, in order to maintain
the whole structure of the Reich...</p>

<p>The <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> represent for us also extraordinary malignant gluttons. We
have now approximately 2500000 of them in <ent type='ORG'>the General Government</ent>
[<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> occupied <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent>], perhaps with the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> mixtures and
everything that goes with it, 3500000 <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>. We cannot shoot or
poison those 3500000 <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>, but we shall nevertheless be able to take
measures which will lead somehow to their annihilation, and this in
connection with the gigantic measures to be determined in discussions
with the Reich.</p>

<p>Subject: Solution of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> question
 .
 .</p>

<p>4) This winter there is a danger that not all of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> can be <ent type='ORG'>fed</ent>
 anymore. One might weigh honestly, if the most humane solution
 might not be to finish off those of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> who are not employable
 by means of some quick-working device. At any rate, that would be
 more pleasant than to let them starve to death.
5) For the rest, the proposal was made that in this camp all the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent>
 women, from whom one could still expect children, should be
 sterilized so that the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> problem may actually be solved
 completely with this generation.</p>

<p>Extracts from the minutes of the Wannsee conference, January 20
1942, regarding the "Final Solution of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> Question"
[Trials of War Criminals Before the <ent type='GPE'>Nuernberg</ent> Military Tribunals - 
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, U.S Govt. Print. Off., 1949-1953, Vol. XIII, p. 210-216]

 II. At the beginning of the meeting the Chief of the <ent type='ORG'>Security</ent>
Police and the SD, <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> Lieutenant General Heydrich, reported his
appointment by <ent type='ORG'>the Reich Marshal</ent> [Goering] to service as
Commissioner for the preparation of the Final Solution of the
<ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> Problem....</p>

<p>In the course of this final solution of the <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent>
Problem, approximately 11 million <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> are involved. They are
distributed among individual countries as follows:</p>

<p>A. <ent type='ORG'>Original Reich Territory [</ent><ent type='GPE'>Altreich</ent>] 131800
 <ent type='GPE'>Austria</ent>   43700
 <ent type='LOC'>East</ent>ern territories   420000
 Government General [<ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> occupied <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent>] 2284000
 .
 .
 .
 The Netherlands   160800
 .
 .
 <ent type='GPE'>Rumania</ent>, including <ent type='GPE'>Bessarabia</ent>   342000
 .
 .
 <ent type='GPE'>Hungary</ent>   742800
 U<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>R     5000000
 .
 .
   White <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>, excluding Bialystok  446484</p>

<p>[Many countries deleted for brevity]</p>

<p>    TOTAL over 11000000
 .
 .</p>

<p>Under proper direction the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> should now in the course of the
Final Solution be brought to the <ent type='LOC'>East</ent> in a suitable way for use 
as labor. In big labor gangs, with separation of the sexes, the
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> capable of work are brought to these areas and employed in
road building, in which task undoubtedly a great part will fall
out through natural diminution.</p>

<p>The remnant that finally is able to survive all this - since this
is undoubtedly the part with the strongest resistance - must
be treated accordingly since these people, representing a natural
selection, are to be regarded as the germ cell of a new <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent>
development. (See the experience of history).</p>

<p>In the program of the practical execution of the Final Solution,
<ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> is combed through from the <ent type='LOC'>West</ent> to the <ent type='LOC'>East</ent>...
 .
 .
In the course of the final solution plans, the <ent type='GPE'>Nuernberg</ent> laws
are in a certain degree to form the basis, and accordingly the
complete settlement of the problem is to include also the
solution of the mixed marriage and the Mischling [people partly
of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> descent]...</p>

<p>The first degree Mischling excepted from the evacuation is to
be sterilized in order to prevent any offspring and to settle
the Mischling problem once and for all...</p>

Re:  the Solution of the <ent type='NORP'>Polish</ent> Question </p>

<p> ...It should be obvious that one cannot solve the <ent type='NORP'>Polish</ent> problem by 
liquidating the <ent type='LOC'>Pole</ent>s in the same way as the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>.  Such a solution 
to the <ent type='NORP'>Polish</ent> problem would burden the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> people with guilt for 
years to come and lose us the sympathies of people everywhere,

they would be treated in the same way when the time came. </p>

 ...The fact that <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> receive special treatment requires no further
discussion. However, it appears hardly believable that this is done
in the way described in the report of the General Commissioner of
1 June 1943. What is Katyn against that? Imagine only that these
occurrences would become known to the other side and exploited by them!
Most likely such propaganda would have no effect only because
people who hear who hear and read about it simply would not be ready
to believe it.</p>

[Hitler and the Final Solution - G. <ent type='ORG'>Fleming</ent>, University of California
Press, 1984, p. 70]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
With regard to my letter of 18 October 1941, please be informed that
Oberdiensleiter [Chief Executive Officer] Brack from the Fuehrer's
Chancellory has stated his readiness to assist in the construction of
the necessary accommodations and gassing apparatuses, so they must
first be constructed. Brack's view is that, since construction of the
apparatuses within the Reich would present far greater difficulties
than on-site production, the most expedient course of action is to
send his people directly to <ent type='GPE'>Riga</ent>, in particular his chemist Dr.
Kallmeyer, who will take the necessary steps from there.
Oberdiensleiter Brack further points out that the procedure in
question is not without its hazards, and that therefore special safety
precautions are needed. Under these circumstances, I ask you to
contact Oberdiensleiter Brack in the Fuehrer's Chancellory through
your higher <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> and Police leader. Please request from him the
dispatching of the chemist Dr. Kallmeyer and any further assistants
that are needed. I might further point out that Sturmbannfuehrer
Eichmann, the adviser on <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> affairs in the Reich main security
office, is in complete accord with this procedure. According to the
information received here from Sturmbannfuehrer Eichmann, camps for
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> will be set up in <ent type='GPE'>Riga</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Minsk</ent>, where <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> from the <ent type='GPE'>Altreich</ent>
[<ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y proper] might also be sent. <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> are currently being
evacuated from the <ent type='GPE'>Altreich</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Lodz</ent> and other camps, from which those
fit for work will be transferred to work forces in the east. Given the
present situation, <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> who are not fit for work can be eliminated
without qualms through use of the Brack device. Incidents such as
those that took place during the shootings of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Vilna</ent>, according
to a report I have on my desk, can hardly be sanctioned, keeping in
mind that the executions were undertaken openly, and the new
procedures assure that such incidents will no longer be possible. <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>
fit for work, on the other hand, will be transported to work forces in
the east. That the men and women in this latter group must be kept
apart from each other goes without saying. Please keep me informed as
to any further measures you take.</p>

houses in the country. The vans became so well known, that not only
the authorities but also the civilian population called the van "death
van", as soon as one of these vehicles appeared. It is my opinion the
van cannot be kept secret for any length of time, not even
camouflaged...</p>

<p>Besides that, I ordered that during application of gas all the men
were to be kept as far away from the vans as possible, so they should
not suffer damage to their health by the gas which eventually would
escape. I should like to take this opportunity to bring the following
to your attention: several commands have had the unloading after the
application of gas done by their own men. I brought to the attention
of those S.K [Special Kommando] concerned the immense psychological
injuries and damages involved to their health that this work can have
for those men, even if not immediately, at least later on. The men
complained to me about head-aches which appeared after each unloading.
Nevertheless they don't want to change the orders, because they are
afraid prisoners called for that work could use an opportune moment to
flee. To protect the men from these damages, I request orders to be
issued accordingly.</p>

<p>The application of the gas is not undertaken correctly. In order to
come to an end as fast as possible, the driver presses the accelerator
to the fullest extent. By doing that the persons to be executed suffer
death from suffocation and not death by dozing off as was planned. My
directions have now proved that by correct adjustment of the levers
death comes faster and the prisoners fall asleep peacefully. Distorted
faces and excretions, such as could be seen before, are no longer
noticed.</p>

RE: Technical alterations to the special vehicles already in operation
and those in production.</p>

<p>Since December 1941, for example, 97000 have been processed using
three vans without any faults developing in the vehicles. The
well-known explosion in <ent type='ORG'>Kulmhof</ent> (Chelmno) must be treated as a special
case. It was caused by faulty practice. Special instructions have been
given to the relevant offices in order to avoid such accidents. The
instructions were such as to ensure a considerable increase in the
degree of security.</p>

<p>Further operational experience hitherto indicates that the following
technical alterations are appropriate....</p>

<p> 2) The vans are normally loaded with 9-10 people per square meter.
With the large <ent type='ORG'>Saurer</ent> special vans this is not possible because
although they do not become overloaded their maneuverability is much
impaired. A reduction in the load area appears desirable. It can be
achieved by reducing the size of the van by c. 1 meter. The difficulty
referred to cannot be overcome by reducing the size of the load. For a
reduction in the numbers will necessitate a longer period of operation
because the free spaces will have to be filled with CO. By contrast, a
smaller load area which is completely full requires a much sorter
period of operation since there are no free spaces.....</p>

<p> 3) The connecting hoses between the exhaust and the van frequently
rust through because they are corroded inside by the liquids which
fall on them.  To prevent this the connecting piece must be moved so
that the gas is <ent type='ORG'>fed</ent> from the top downwards. This will prevent liquids
flowing in.....</p>

<p> 6) The lighting must be better protected against damage than
hitherto....It has been suggested that lighting should be dispensed
with since they are allegedly never used. However, experience shows
that when the rear door is closed and therefore when it becomes dark,
the cargo presses hard towards the door....It makes it difficult to
latch the door. Furthermore, it has been observed that the noise
always begins when the doors are shut presumably because of fear
brought on by the darkness.</p>

In <ent type='GPE'>Kiev</ent>, difficulties that arose during the execution of a major action
of this type - particularly with regard to registration - were overcome
by the use of posters announcing that all <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> were to report for
resettlement. Although it was initially thought that the action would
only involve 5000 to 6000 <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>, more than 30000 <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> reported, who
as a result of extremely efficient organization still believed they
were going to be resettled right up until the time they were executed.</p>

<p>Despite that fact that up to now a total of some 75000 <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> have been
liquidated in this way, it has nevertheless become apparent that this
method will not provide a solution to the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> problem.</p>

The resettlement of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> (which partly assumes forms not worthy of

the <ent type='ORG'>Gestapo</ent> with those of the <ent type='ORG'>GPU</ent>. The railway wagons are said to
be in such a bad state that it is impossible to prevent <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> breaking
out. The result is that at wayside stations there occur wild shootings
and regular man-hunts. It is also reported that corpses of shot <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>
lie on the streets for days. Although the Reich <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>s, as well as
the foreign population, are convinced of the necessity of liquidating
all <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>, it would still be more appropriate to carry this out in
a manner that causes less sensation and offense.</p>

<ent type='ORG'>Dear Reich</ent> Minister,</p>

<p>The measure being taken at present with mental patients of all
kinds have caused a complete lack of confidence in justice among
large groups of people. Without the consent of relatives and
guardians, such patients are being transferred to different
institutions. After a short time they are notified that the
person concerned has died of some disease...</p>

<p>If the state really wants to carry out the extermination of these
or at least of some mental patients, shouldn't a law be
promulgated, which can be justified before the people - a law
that would give everyone the assurance od careful examination
as to whether he is due to die or entitled to live and which
would also give the relatives a chance to be heard, in a
similar way, as provided by the law for the prevention of
Hereditarily affected Progeny?</p>

<ent type='ORG'>Dear Reich</ent> Minister,</p>

<p>On July 19th I sent you a letter about the systematic extermination
of lunatics, feeble-minded and epileptic persons. Since then this
practice has reached tremendous proportions: recently the inmates of
old-age homes have also been included. The basis for this practice
seems to be that in an efficient nation there should be no room
for weak and frail people. It is evident from the many reports which
we are receiving that the people's feelings are being badly hurt
by the measures ordered and that the feeling of legal insecurity
is spreading which is regrettable from the point of view of national
and state interest.</p>

Regarding the report submitted on July 16 by the Chairman of the Fulda
Bishops' conference, Cardinal Dr. Bertram, I consider it my duty to
present the following as a concrete illustration of destruction of
so-called "useless life".</p>

<p>About 8 Kilometers from <ent type='GPE'>Limburg</ent> in the little town of Hadamar, on a
hill overlooking the town, there is an institution which had formerly
served various purposes and of late had been used as a nursing home.
This institution was renovated and furnished as a place in which, by
consensus of opinion, the above mentioned Euthanasia has been
systematically practiced for months- approximately since February
1941. This fact is, of course, known beyond the administrative
district of <ent type='GPE'>Wiesbaden</ent>...</p>

<p>Several times a week buses arrive in Hadamard with a considerable
number of such victims. School children of the vicinity know this
vehicle and say "here comes the murder-box again". After the arrival
of the vehicle, the citizens of Hadamar watch the smoke rise out of
the chimney...</p>

<p>The effect of the principles at work here that children call each
other names and say "you're crazy; you'll be sent to the baking oven
in Hadamar"...</p>

<p>All God-fearing man consider this destruction of helpless beings a
crass injustice...</p>

<p>Officials of the State Police, it is said, are trying to suppress
discussions of the Hadamar occurrences by means of severe threats...</p>

<p>I beg you most humbly, Herr Reich Minister, in the sense of the report
of the Episcopate of 16 July of this year, to prevent further
transgressions of the Fifth Commandment of God.</p>

Dear Brack,</p>

<p>I hear there is great excitement on the <ent type='ORG'>Alb</ent> because of the Grafeneck
Institution. 
The population recognizes the gray automobiles of the <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> and think they
know what is going on at the constantly smoking crematory.  What happens
there is a secret and yet is no longer one.  Thus the worst feeling has
arisen there, and in my opinion there remains only one thing, to
discontinue the use of the institution in this place and in any event
disseminate information in a clever and sensible manner by showing motion
pictures on the subject of inherited and mental diseases in just that
locality. 
May I ask for a report as to how the difficult problem is solved?</p>

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Honorable Mr. Reichsfuehrer!</p>

<p>On instruction from Reichsleiter Bouhler I placed a part of my men at
the disposal of Brigadefuehrer Globocnik some considerable time ago
for his special task. Following a further request from him, I have
now made available more personnel. On this occasion Brigadefuehrer 
Globocnik pressed the view that the whole action against the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> 
should be carried out as quickly as it is in any way possible, so
that we will not some day be stuck in the middle should any kind
of difficulty make it necessary to stop the action. you yourself,
Mr. Reichsfuehrer, expressed the view to me at an earlier time that
one must work as fast as possible, if only for reasons of concealment.
Both views are more than justified according to my own experience,
and basically they produce the same results. Nevertheless I beg to
be permitted to present the following consideration of my own in
this connection:</p>

<p>According to my impression there are at least 2-3 million men and
women well fit for work among the approx. 10 million <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>. In consideration of the exceptional difficulties posed for
us by the question of labor, I am of the opinion that these 2-3
million should in any case be taken out and kept alive. Of course
this can only be done if they are in the same time rendered
incapable of reproduction. I reported to you about a year ago that
persons under my instruction have completed the necessary experiments
for this purpose. I wish to bring up these facts again. The type
of sterilization which is normally carried out on persons with
genetic disease is out of the question in this case, as it takes
too much time and is expensive. Castration by means of X-rays, 
however, is not only relatively cheap, but can be carried out on
many thousands in a very short time. I believe that it has become
unimportant at the present time whether those affected will then
in the course of a few weeks or months realize by the effects that
they are castrated.</p>

<p>In the event, Mr. Reichsfuehrer, that you decide to choose these
means in the interest of maintaining labor-material, Reichsleiter
Bouhler will be ready to provide the doctors and other personnel
needed to carry out this work. He also instructed me to inform you
that I should then order the required equipment as quickly as
possible.</p>

Prompted by the thought that the enemy must not only be conquered but
exterminated, I feel obliged to submit the following to you as the
Reich Plenipotentiary for the Consolidation of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> Folkdom:</p>

<p>Dr. <ent type='GPE'>Madous</ent> is publishing the results of his research into sterilization
by medicaments (I enclose both works). In reading this article, I was
struck by the enormous importance of this medicament in the present
struggle of our people. Should it be possible to produce as soon as
possible, as a result of this research, a medicament which, after a
comparatively brief period, would cause an unnoticed sterilization
in individuals, we would have in our disposal a new and very effective
weapon. The thought alone that the 3 million <ent type='NORP'>Bolsheviks</ent> now in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>
captivity could be sterilized, so that they would be available for
work but precluded from propagation, opens up the most far-reaching
perspectives.</p>

------------------------------------------------------------------
At the orders of Gauleiter Dr. Jury, his staff have hitherto busied
themselves especially with the problems of population, racial policy,
and antisocial elements. Since the prevenation of reproduction by
the congenitally unfit and racially inferior belongs to the duties
of our <ent type='ORG'>National Socialist</ent> racial and demographic policy, the present 
director of the District Office for Racial Policy, Gauhauptstellenleiter
Dr. Fehringer, has examined the question of sterilization and found
that the methods so far available, castration and sterilization, are
not sufficient in themselves to meet expectations. Consequently, the
obvious question occurred to him whether impotence and sterility in
could not be produced in men and women by the administration of medicine
or injections...</p>

<p>The director of my race policy office points out that the necessary
research and human experiments could be undertaken by by an
appropriately selected medical staff, basing their work on the
<ent type='ORG'>Madaus</ent> animal experiments in cooperation with the pharmacological
institute of the Faculty of Medicine of <ent type='GPE'>Vienna</ent>, on the persons of
of the inmates of the Gypsy camp of <ent type='GPE'>Lackenbach</ent> in Lower Danube.</p>

Dear Brack,</p>

<p>It is only today that I have the opportunity of acknowledging the
receipt of your letter of June 23. I am positively interested in
seeing the sterilization by X-rays tried out at least once in one camp
in a series of experiments.</p>

------------------------------------------------------------------------
By order of Reichsleiter Bouhler I submit to you as an enclosure a work
of Dr. Horst Schumann on the influence of X-rays on human genital glands.</p>

<p>Previously you have asked Oberfuehrer Brack to perform this work, and
you supported it by providing the adequate material in the concentration
camp Auschwitz. I point especially to the second part of this work,
which shows that by those means castration of males is almost impossible
or requires an effort which does not pay. As I have convinced myself,
operative castration requires not more than 6 to 7 minutes, and therefore
can be performed more reliably and quicker than castration by X-rays.</p>

<p>Soon I will be able to submit a continuation of this work to you.</p>

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Today the Reich Leader <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> charged me with transmitting to you his wish
that you go to <ent type='ORG'>Ravensbrueck</ent> after you have had another talk with
<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-Obergruppenfuehrer Pohl and the camp physician of the women's
concentration camp <ent type='ORG'>Ravensbrueck</ent>, in order to perform the sterilization
of <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>esses according to your method...</p>

<p>Thorough experiments should be conducted to investigate the effect of
the sterilization largely in a way that you find out after a certain
time, which you would have to fix, perhaps by X-rays, what kind of
changes have taken place. In some cases a practical experiment might
be arranged by locking up a <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ess and a <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent> together for a certain
period and then seeing what results are achieved.</p>

    <ent type='ORG'>Fuehrer Headquarters</ent>, July 1942</p>

<p>On 7 July 1942 a discussion took place between the Reich Leader <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-Brigadefuehrer Professor Dr. Gebhart, <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-Brigadefuehrer Gluecks,
and <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-Brigadefuehrer Clauberg, Koenigshette. The topic of the
discussion was the sterilization of <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>esses. The Reich Leader
<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> has promised Brigadefuehrer Professor Clauberg that Auschwitz
concentration camp will be at his disposal for his experiments on
human beings and animals. By means of some fundamental experiments,
a method should be found which would lead to sterilization of persons
without their knowledge. The Reich Leader <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> wanted to get another
report as soon as the result of these experiments was known, so
that the sterilization of <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>esses could then be carried out in 
actuality.</p>

<p>It should also be examined, preferably in cooperation with Professor
Dr. Hohlfelder, an X-ray specialist in <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, what way sterilization
of men could be achieved by X-ray treatment.</p>

<p>The Reich Leader <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> called the special attention of all gentlemen
present to the fact that the matter involved was most secret and
should be discussed only with the officers in charge and that
the persons present at the experiments had to pledge secrecy.</p>

<p>Letter from Professor Clauberg to <ent type='ORG'>Himmler</ent>, June 7 1943, on his
research concerning sterilization of women

<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, U.S Govt. Print. Off., 1949-1953, Vol 1, p. 730]
----------------------------------------------------------------
<ent type='ORG'>Dear Reich</ent> Leader,</p>

<p>Today I am fulfilling my obligation to report to you from time to
time about the state of my research work...</p>

<p>The method I contrived to achieve the sterilization of the female
organism without operation is as good as perfected. It can be
performed by a single injection made through the entrance of
the uterus in the course of the customary gynecological
examination known to every physician. If I say that the
method is "as good as perfected" this means:</p>

<p>1. Still to be worked out are only minor improvements of the method.</p>

<p>2. Already today it could be put to practical use in the course
 of our regular eugenic sterilization and could thus replace
 the operation.</p>

<p>As to the question which you, Reich Leader, asked me almost a
one year ago, i.e., how much time would probably be required
to sterilize 1000 women by using this method. Today I can
answer you with regard to the future as follows:</p>

<p>If my researches continue to have the same results as up to 
now - and there is no reason to doubt that - then the moment is
not far off when I can say:</p>

<p>"One adequately trained physician in one adequately equipped
 place, with perhaps 10 assistants (the number of assistants in
 conformity with the speed desired) will most likely be able to
 deal with several hundred, if not even 1000 per day".</p>

<p>As you know, the Reichsfuehrer-<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> has directed that
<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-Hauptsturmfuehrer Prof. Dr. Hirt be supplied with everything
needed for his research work. For certain anthropological
researches - I already reported to the Reichsfuehrer-<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> on

<ent type='ORG'>Dear Reich</ent>sfuehrer,</p>

<p>The fuehrer's Commissioner-General, <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> Brigadefuehrer Professor Dr. Brandt,
called me with the request that I should assist him by placing prisoners
at his disposal for research work into the cause of contagious 
jaundice (Hepatitis epidemica) which he was furthering considerably.</p>

<p>The work has been carried out up to now by a medical captain, Dr. Dohmen,
within the framework of the research place of the army medical inspectorate,
with the participation of the Robert Koch institute. It has up to now led
to the result, in agreement with the result of other <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> research
workers, that contagious jaundice is not carried by bacteria but by a
virus. In order to increase our knowledge, which is based up to now
only on vaccination experiments from men to animals, the reverse way
is now necessary, namely the vaccination of the cultivated virus germ
into humans. One must reckon on cases of death.</p>

Highly esteemed Reich Leader:</p>

<p>Enclosed is an interim report on the low-pressure experiments so far
conducted in the concentration camp of <ent type='GPE'>Dachau</ent>...</p>

<p>Only continuous experiments at altitudes higher than 10.5 Km resulted
in death. These experiments showed that breathing stopped after about
30 minutes, while in two cases the electrocardiographically charted
action of the heart continued for another 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The third experiment of this type took such an extraordinary course
that I called an <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> physician of the camp as a witness, since I had
worked on these experiments all by myself. It was a continuous
experiment without oxygen at a height of 12 Km. conducted on a 37-year
old <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent> in good general condition. Breathing continued up to 30
minutes. After 4 minutes the experimental subject began to perspire
and to wiggle his head, after 5 minutes cramps occurred, between 6
and 10 minutes breathing increased in speed and the experimental
subject became unconscious; from 11 to 30 minutes breathing slowed
down to three breaths per minute, finally stopping altogether. </p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Severest</ent> cyanosis developed in between and foam appeared at the mouth...</p>

<p> Autopsy report
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>One hour later after breathing had stopped, the spinal marrow was
completely severed and the brain was removed. Thereupon the action
of the auricle stopped for 40 seconds. In then renewed its action,
coming to a complete standstill 8 minutes later. A heavy subarchnoid
oedema was found in the brain. In the veins and arteries of the brain
a considerable quantity of air was discovered.</p>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Highly esteemed Reich Leader,</p>

<p>Enclosed I am forwarding a short summary on the principle experiments
conducted up to date...</p>

<p>For the following experiments <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> professional criminals who had 
committed race pollution were used. The question of the formation of 
embolism was investigated in 10 cases. Some of the experimental subjects 
died during a continued high-altitude experiment; for instance, after
one-half hour at the height of 12 Km. After the skull had been opened
under water an ample amount of air embolism was found in the brain
vessels and, in part, free air in the brain ventricles.</p>

<p>To find out whether the severe psychic and physical effects, as 
mentioned under No. 3, are due to the formation of embolism, the
following was done: After relative recuperation from such a 
parachute descending test had taken place, however, before regaining
consciousness, some experimental subjects were kept under water
until they died. When the skull and the cavities of the breast and
of the abdomen had been opened under water, an enormous amount of
air embolism was found in the vessels of the brain, the coronary
vessels, and vessels of the liver and the intestines, etc.</p>

<p>It was also proved by experiments that air embolism occurs in
practically all vessels even while pure oxygen is being inhaled.
One experimental subject was made to breathe pure oxygen for
2.5 hours before the experiment started. After 6 minutes at a
height of 20 Km, he died and at dissection also showed ample
air embolism, as was the case in all other experiments.</p>

<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, U.S Govt. Print. Off., 1949-1953, Vol. I, p. 220]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The experimental subjects were placed in the water, dressed in complete
flying uniform, winter or summer combination, and with an aviator's
helmet. A life jacket made out of rubber kapok was to prevent
submerging. The experiments were carried out at water temperatures
varying from from 2.5 to 12 Centigrade. In one experimental series,
the <ent type='ORG'>occiput</ent> (brain stem) protruded above the water, while in another
series of experiments the <ent type='ORG'>occiput</ent> (brain stem) and back of the head
were submerged in water.</p>

<p>Electrical measurements gave low temperature readings of 26.4 in the
stomach and 26.5 in the rectum. Fatalities occurred only when the
brain stem and the back of the head were also chilled. Autopsies of
of such fatal cases always revealed large amounts of free blood, up
to one-half litter, in the cranial cavity.</p>

--------------------------------------------------------------------
If the experimental subject was placed in the water under narcosis,
one observed a certain arousing effect. The subject began to groan
and made some defensive movements. In a few cases a state of excitation
developed. This was especially severe in the cooling of head and
neck. But never was a complete cessation of the narcosis observed.
The defensive movements ceased after about 5 minutes. There
followed a progressive rigor, which developed especially strongly
in the arm musculature; the arms were strongly flexed and pressed to
the body. The rigor increased with the continuation of the cooling,
now and then interrupted by tonic-clonic twitchings. With still more
marked sinking of the body temperature it suddenly ceased. These
cases ended fatally, without any successful results from resuscitation
efforts.</p>

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Reich leader <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> wants to be informed of the state of the
experiments. I can announce that the experiments have been
concluded, with the exception of those on warming with body
heat. The final report will be ready in about 5 days. Prof.
Holzloehner, for reasons I cannot fathom, does not himself
want to make the report to the Reich Leader <ent type='ORG'>Himmler</ent> and has
asked me to attend to it. This report must be made before
20 October, because the great <ent type='ORG'>Luftwaffe</ent> [<ent type='NORP'>German</ent> air-force]
conference on freezing takes place on <ent type='GPE'>Nuernberg</ent> on 25 October.
The report on the results of our research must be made there,
to assure that they be used in time for the troops. May I ask 
you to arrange for a decision from the Reich Leader regarding
the final report to him, and the submission to him of the
relevant material? </p>

<p>Today I received your letter of 22 September 1942, in which the
Reich Leader orders that the experiments on warming through
body heat must absolutely be conducted. Because of incomplete
address it was delayed. Today I asked Obersturmbannfuehrer
Sievers to send a telegram to the camp commander immediately,
to the effect that four Gypsy women be procured at once
from another camp. Moreover, I asked <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> Obersturmbannfuehrer
Sievers to take steps to have the low pressure chamber ready
for use.</p>

[Hitler and the Final Solution - G. <ent type='ORG'>Fleming</ent>, University of California
Press, 1984, p. 142-143]
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Auschwitz camp plays a special role in the resolution of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent>
question. The most advance methods permit the execution of the
Fuehrer-order in the shortest possible time and without arousing much
attention. The so-called "resettlement action" runs the following
course: The <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> arrive in special trains (freight cars) toward
evening and are driven on special tracks to areas of the camp
specifically set aside for this purpose. There the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> are unloaded
and examined for their fitness to work by a team of doctors, in the
presence of the camp commandant and several <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> officers. At this point
anyone who can somehow be incorporated into the work program is put in
a special camp. <ent type='ORG'>The curably ill</ent> are sent straight to a medical camp
and are restored to health through a special diet. The basic principle
behind everything is: conserve all manpower for work. The previous
type of "resettlement action" has been thoroughly rejected, since it
is too costly to destroy precious work energy on a continual basis.</p>

<p>The unfit go to cellars in a large house which are entered from
outside.  They go down five or six steps into a fairly long,
well-constructed and well-ventilated cellar area, which is lined with
benches to the left and right. It is brightly lit, and the benches are
numbered.  The prisoners are told that they are to be cleansed and
disinfected for their new assignments.  They must therefore completely
undress to be bathed. To avoid panic and to prevent disturbances of
any kind, they are instructed to arrange their clothing neatly under
their respective numbers, so that they will be able to find their
things again after their bath.  Everything proceeds in a perfectly
orderly fashion.  Then they pass through a small corridor and enter a
large cellar room which resembles a shower bath.  In this room are
three large pillars, into which certain materials can be lowered from
outside the cellar room. When three- to four-hundred people have been
herded into this room, the doors are shut, and containers filled with
the substances are dropped down into the pillars.  As soon as the
containers touch the base of the pillars, they release particular
substances that put the people to sleep in one minute. A few minutes
later, the door opens on the other side, where the elevator is
located. The hair of the corpses is cut off, and their teeth are
extracted (gold-filled teeth) by specialists (<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>). It has been
discovered that <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> were hiding pieces of <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>elry, gold, platinum
etc., in hollow teeth. Then the corpses are loaded into elevators and
brought up to the first floor, where ten large crematoria are located.
(Because fresh corpses burn particularly well, only 50-100 lbs. of
coke are needed for the whole process.)  The job itself is performed
by <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> prisoners, who never step outside this camp again.</p>

<p>The results of this "resettlement action" to date: 500000 <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>.
Current capacity of the "resettlement action" ovens: 10000 in 24
hours.</p>

2 September 1942</p>

<p>3.00 a.m. attended my first Sonderaktion. Dante's Inferno seems to 
me almost a comedy compared to this. They don't call Auschwitz the
extermination camp for nothing!</p>

<p>[Sonderaktion = special action, meaning extermination; in this case,
 gassing. See, for instance, two following document].</p>

<p>5 September 1942</p>

<p>In the morning attended a Sonderaktion from the women's concentration
camp (<ent type='NORP'>Muslims</ent>); the most dreadful of horrors. Hschf. Thilo -- army
doctor -- was right when he said to me this is the 'anus mundi'. In
the evening towards 8.00 attended another Sonderaktion from
<ent type='GPE'>Holland</ent>.</p>

<p>['<ent type='NORP'>Muslims</ent>' does not mean "practicing <ent type='ORG'>Islam</ent>"; this is the way the <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>

<p>Extracted and fixed fresh live material from liver, spleen and

<p>11 October 1942</p>

<p>Today, Sunday, there was roast hare for lunch -- a real fat leg -- with
dumplings and red cabbage for 1.25 RM.</p>

<p>12 October 1942</p>

<p>Second inoculation against typhus, later on in the evening severe
generalized reaction (fever). Despite this in the night attended a
further Sonderaktion from <ent type='GPE'>Holland</ent> (1600 persons). Ghastly scenes in
front of the last bunker! That was the 10th Sonderaktion.</p>

<p>13 November 1942</p>

<p>Extracted fresh live material (liver, spleen and pancreas) from a
previously photographed, severely atrophied <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> prisoner aged
eighteen. Fixed as always, liver and spleen in <ent type='LOC'>Carnoy</ent> and pancreas in

[This document is interesting for two reasons: first, it demonstrates
that the underground cellars in the crematoriums could not have possibly
been morgues, as morgues are never heated; heating, however, does 
facilitate the evaporation of Zyklon-B. Also, the document - like
many others - makes reference to an "undressing room", and there is
no reason for a morgue to have one near by. Pressac contains numerous
other documents attesting to the design and use of the Auschwitz gas
chambers. Even the fake shower heads are mentioned].</p>

<p>Subject: KL Auschwitz Krematorien II and III</p>

<p>In accordance with your suggestion, the service agrees that cellar 1
should be preheated with the air coming from the rooms of the 3
forced draught installations. The supply and installation of the
ductwork and blowers necessary to this end are to be effected as soon
as possible. As you point out in your above-mentioned letter, 
execution should commence this week. We would ask you to send in
triplicate detailed quote for supply and installation.</p>

<p>At the same time, we would ask you to send an additional quotation
for the modification of the air-extraction installation in the
undressing room.</p>

a) Only such measures may be taken which do not jeopardize
 <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> life or property (for instance, burning of synagogues
 only if there is no danger of fires for the neighbourhoods).</p>

<p>b) Business establishments and homes of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> may be destroyed but
 not looted. The police have been instructed to supervise the
 execution of these directives and to arrest looters.</p>

<p>c) In Business streets special care is to be taken that non-<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent>
 establishments will be safeguarded at all cost against damage.

<p>As soon as the events of this night permit the use of the designated
officers, as many <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>, particularly wealthy ones, as the local
jails will hold, are to be arrested in all districts. Initially
only healthy male <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>, not too old, are to be arrested. After
the arrests have been carried out the appropriate concentration
camp is to be contacted immediately with a view to a quick
transfer of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> to the camps...</p>

<p>VERDICT OF <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-COURT
*******************</p>

<p>Excerpts from Verdict of the <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> Court in <ent type='GPE'>Munich</ent>, against 
<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-Untersturmfuehrer Max Taubner, 24 of May 1943
['The Good Old Days' - E. Klee, W. Dressen, V. Riess, The Free Press, 
NY, 1988, p, 196-207]
-----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>1. The accused shall not be punished because of the actions against
the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> as such. The <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> have to be exterminated and none of the 
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> that were killed is any great loss. Although the accused should
have recognized that the extermination of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> was the duty of
<ent type='ORG'>Kommandos</ent> which were set up especially for this purpose, he should
be excused for considering himself to have the authority to take
part in the extermination of <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ry himself. Real hatred of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>
was the driving motivation for the accused. In the process he let
himself be drawn into committing cruel actions in <ent type='ORG'>Alexandriya</ent> which
are unworthy of a <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> man and an <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-officer. These excesses cannot
be justified, either, as the accused would like to, as retaliation
for the pain that the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> have caused the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> people. It is not
the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> way to apply Bolshevic methods during the necessary
extermination of the worst enemy of our people. In so doing the
conduct of the accused gives rise to considerable concern. The
accused allowed his men to act with such vicious brutality that
they conducted themselves under his command like a savage horde...</p>

<p>2. By taking photographs of the incidents or having photographs
taken, by having these developed in photographic shops and showing
them to his wife and friends, the accused is guilty of disobedience.
Such pictures could pose the gravest risks to the security of the
Reich if they fell into the wrong hands...</p>

<p>Dismissal of the case against the remaining parties, 1 June 1943</p>

<p>The following has been established on the basis of the main trial
of <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-Untersturmfuehrer Max Taubner...
The following men were party to the punishable acts committed or
ordered by <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-Untersturmfuehrer Max Taubner:</p>

<p>1. <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-Unterscharfuehrer Walter Muller particularly stood out during
the shootings of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> with the brutality with which he tore small
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> children from their mothers. He held these children in
front of him with his left hand and then, with his right hand,
shot them with a pistol.</p>

<p> .
 . [three more <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-personnel accused]
 .</p>

<p>Allowances have been made for the fact that the accused were, without
exception, acting on the orders of and under the responsibility
of Untersturmfuehrer Max Taubner. In this respect, their own 
culpability may be described as slight...</p>

<p>The cases against these accused have therefore been dismissed.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Memorandum</ent> from the Ministry of <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> to Hitler, regarding prosecution

--------------------------------------------------------------------
After the birth of her child, a full-blooded <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ess sold her mother
milk to a pediatrician and concealed that she was a <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ess. With
this milk babies of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> blood were <ent type='ORG'>fed</ent> in a nursing home for
children. The accused will be charged with deception. The buyers of 
the milk have suffered damage, for mother's milk from a <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ess
cannot be regarded as food for <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> children. The impudent behavior
of the accused is an insult as well. Relevant charges, however, have
not been applied for, so that the parents, who are unaware of the
true facts, need not subsequently be worried.</p>

<p>I shall discuss with the Reich health leader the racial hygienic
aspect of the case.</p>

<p>Death to the "Race Defiler":
Excerpts from Opinion and Sentence of the <ent type='GPE'>Nuernberg</ent> Special Court in
the Katzenberger Case
[Trials of War Criminals Before the <ent type='GPE'>Nuernberg</ent> Military Tribunals - 
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, U.S Govt. Print. Off., 1949-1953, Vol. III, 653-663]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Findings:</p>

<p>1. The defendant Katzenberger is fully <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> and a <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> national; he
 is a member of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> religious community...</p>

<p>2. Irene Seiler is a <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> citizen of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> blood...</p>

<p>[Testimonies about the relationship between Katzenberger and Seiler deleted]</p>

<p>The court is therefore convinced that Katzenberger, after the <ent type='GPE'>Nuernberg</ent> laws
had come into effect, had repeated sexual intercourse with Seiler, up to
March 1940...</p>

<p>The conduct to which the defendants admitted and which in the case of
Katzenberger and consisted in drawing Seiler close to him, kissing
her, patting and caressing her thighs over her clothes, makes it clear
that in a crude manner Katzenberger did to Seiler what is popularly
called "Abschmieren" [petting]. It is obvious that such actions
are motivated only by sexual impulses. Even if the <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent> had only done
these so-called "<ent type='ORG'>Ersatzhandlungen</ent>" [sexual acts in lieu of actual
intercourse] to Seiler, it would have been sufficient to charge him
with racial pollution in the full sense of the law...</p>

<p>He is therefore guilty of a continuous crime of racial pollution
according to sections 2 and 5, paragraph 11 of the Law for
Protection of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> Blood and <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> Honor of 15 September 1935...</p>

<p>As the only feasible answer to the frivolous conduct of the defendant,
the court therefore deems it necessary to pronounce the death sentence
as the heaviest punishment provided by section 4 of the decree
against public enemies...</p>

from the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>: Expulsion or extermination! Both methods have been
tried in the course of the centuries, but they were never carried
to a conclusion...</p>

<p>The teaching of <ent type='NORP'>Christianity</ent> has stood in the way of a radical
solution of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> problem in <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>...</p>

<p>Fate has decreed that it was finally left to the 20th century to see
the total solution of the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> problem. Just how this solution
will be achieved has been made known to the <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>an nations and
to entire non-<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> humanity in a proclamation read out by the
Fuehrer of the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> people on the 24th February 1942:</p>

<p>Today the ideas of our <ent type='ORG'>Nationalsocialists</ent> and those of the <ent type='NORP'>Fascist</ent>
revolution have conquered large and mighty nations and my
prophecy will find its fulfillment, that in this war not the
<ent type='NORP'>Aryan</ent> race will be destroyed, but the <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent> will be exterminated.
What ever else this struggle may lead to, or however long it
may endure, this will be the final result.</p>

<p>Two thousand children rejoiced with Julius Streicher...</p>

<p>The Gauleiter [Streicher] told the little ones about the terrible times
after the war, when the Devil dominated mankind. "Do you know who the
Devil is", he asked his breathlessly listening audience. "The <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>, the

Dear comarade Brandt,</p>

<p>Concerning the matter "children of executed <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Czech</ent>s</ent>" I wish to
reply to your letter as directed to <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-Lieutenant General Frank,
date 6 February of this year, diary index No. 26/2/44 g Bra/H,
that the conversation between <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-Lieutenant General Frank and
<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> Colonel Sollmann took place on 2 July of last year in <ent type='GPE'>Prague</ent>.
Colonel Sollmann stated during this conversation that racially
valuable children up to six years would be considered eligible
by the "Lebensborn"...</p>

<p>It was intended, to have children up to six years and suitable 
for <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>ization brought into <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> families through the
"Lebensborn"...</p>

<p>It is intended to have the racially acceptable elements of the
collectively housed children transferred through the "Lebensborn"
to <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> families or to a children's home whereas the
children over 16 years are to be sent to a concentration camp.</p>

If any <ent type='LOC'>Pole</ent> has any sexual dealing with a <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> woman, and by this
I mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in
front of his camp. Then the others will not do it. Besides,
provisions will be made that a sufficient number of <ent type='NORP'>Polish</ent> women
and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this
kind is out of the question.</p>

<p>The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and
where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline
cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp.
This we must do, unless these one million <ent type='LOC'>Pole</ent>s and those
hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict
untold damage on the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> blood. Philosophizing is of no avail
in this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all -
we all know that - but we need them.</p>

<p>From the speech of Reichsfuehrer-<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Himmler</ent>, speaking to <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>

-------------------------------------------------------------------
One basic principal must be the absolute rule for the <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent> man: we
must be honest, decent, loyal, and comradely to members of our own
blood and to nobody else. What happens to a <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>n, to a <ent type='NORP'>Czech</ent>,
does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer
in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping
their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in
prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we
need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest
to me. Whether 10000 <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>n females fall down from exhaustion
while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as
the anti-tank ditch for <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y is finished. We shall never be rough
and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>s,
who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude
towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these
human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry
about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and
grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone
comes to me and says, "I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women
and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them", then I
would have to say, "you are a murderer of your own blood because
if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> soldiers will die, and
they are the sons of <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> mothers. They are our own blood".</p>

<ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent> can only be administered by utilizing the country through

for work within <ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y, reduction of the entire <ent type='NORP'>Polish</ent> economy
to absolute minimum necessary for bare existence of the population,
closing of all educational institutions, especially technical
schools and colleges in order to prevent the growth of a new

Dear Pruetzmann,</p>

<p>Infantry general staff has special orders with regard to the Donetz
area. Get in touch with him immediately. I order you to cooperate as
much as you can. The aim to be achieved is that when areas in the 
<ent type='GPE'>Ukraine</ent> are evacuated, not a human being, not a single head of cattle, 
not a hundredweight of cereals and not a railway line remain behind; 
that not a house remain standing, not a mine is available which is 
not destroyed for years to come, that there is not a well which is 
not poisoned. The enemy must really find completely burned and destroyed
land. Discuss these things with Stampf straight away and do your
absolute best.</p>

<p>Detailed report by <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-Standartenfuehrer Jager about mass killings
in <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> occupied U<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>R, July-November 1941
['The Good Old Days' - E. Klee, W. Dressen, V. Riess, The Free Press, 
NY, 1988, p. 46-58].
------------------------------------------------------------------
[The "Jager report" was written by a commander of one of the
"Einsatzgruppen" (special task forces) which were in charge of
liquidating <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>, communist leaders, partisans and others in the
<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union.</p>

<p>To understand the magnitude of the massacres, note the total number
of victims - 137346. This is for one Einsatzgruppen, in a five month
period, in one area. This report reflects very clearly on the plan
to kill all the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>, except those which were needed for working
purposes; those were, as the report notes, "only" to be sterilized;
Jager goes on to state that "if despite sterilization a <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ess becomes 
pregnant she will be liquidated".</p>

<p>There are many documents about the Einsatzgruppen massacres in the
<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union, but the "Jager report" is one of the most chillingly
detailed of them].</p>

<p>Today I can confirm that our objective, to solve the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> problem for
<ent type='GPE'>Lithuania</ent>, has been achieved by <ent type='ORG'>EK</ent> 3. In <ent type='GPE'>Lithuania</ent> there are no more
<ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent>, apart from <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> workers and their families.</p>

<div> .
 .
 .</div>

<p>The distance between from the assembly point to the graves was on average
4 to 5 Km.</p>

<div> .
 .
 .</div>

<p>I consider the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ish</ent> action more or less terminated as far as
<ent type='ORG'>Einsatzkommando</ent> 3 is concerned. Those working <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>esses still
available are needed urgently and I can envisage that after the winter
this workforce will be required even more urgently. I am of the view
that the sterilization program of the male worker <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>s</ent> should be
started immediately so that reproduction is prevented. If despite
sterilization a <ent type='NORP'>Jew</ent>ess becomes pregnant she will be liquidated.</p>
