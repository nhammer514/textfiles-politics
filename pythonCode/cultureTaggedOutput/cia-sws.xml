<p> unless we know MUCH MORE about the atrocities committed "in the interests 
 and name of `national security,'" how can we possibly become sufficiently 
 motivated and driven to dedicate our energies towards changing this form 
 of "government" by lies, dissembling, expediency, profit-as-god, and 
 murder?  we have no idea what is "done in our name."  if we did, we would 
 no longer be able to participate in its commoditized seductiveness because
 we would not be able to look ourselves in the mirror or sleep at night.

   THE <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>'S SECRET WEAPONS SYSTEMS
    by Andrew Stark</p>

<p>  Exploding wine bottles, guns constructed out of pipes,
  bullets made of teeth, aspirin explosives:  they sound like
  props from a second-rate spy story.  <ent type='ORG'>Horrifyingly</ent> enough,
  they are real.  The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> has spent a great deal of its time--
  and your money--developing countless bizarre weapons for
  assassination, sabotage, and mass destruction.  If that's
  news to you, it's because the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> doesn't want these
  products, some of which are quite easy to put together, to
  fall into the "wrong hands."  As for whether they are in the
  right hands now--judge for yourself.</p>

<p>   The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> has developed many exotic and sophisticated devices
  intended for use in interrogation, sabotage, and assassination.
  These weapons are necessary--if you grant that what the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> itself
  does is necessary.  If the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> wants to eliminate a key <ent type='ORG'>KGB</ent> agent
  operating in <ent type='GPE'>Hungary</ent>, it faces certain problems.  It would be
  virtually impossible to slip a deadly weapon, such as a gun or
  bomb, past <ent type='NORP'>Hungarian</ent> customs officials.  Thus, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> assassin
  must assemble his weapon from commonly obtainable materials after
  he crosses the border.
   The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agent might decide to construct a urea nitrate
  explosive, commonly known as a urine bomb.  This weapon is quite
  deadly, easily exploded, and consists primarily of nitric acid and
  urine.  The urine bomb is one of literally hundreds of murderous
  weapons in the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> arsenal.
   "The New York Times" of September 26, 1975 revealed the
  existence of guns that shoot cobra-venom darts.  Then there was the
  shoe polish compound intended to make Fidel Castro's beard fall
  out, so that he would lose his "charisma."  And <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> laboratories in
  <ent type='GPE'>Fort Monmouth</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent> developed the famous rifle that shoots
  around corners.
   Some <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> weapons are designed to kill many people--deadly germs
  can be released in subways;  others are intended to kill a single,
  specific individual--the Borgia ring contains deadly poison to be
  slipped into a victim's drink;  and still others are standard
  weapons supplied for such missions as overthrowing the Allende
  government in <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent> in 1973.
   The information about <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> weapons that you will read in this
  article generally has not been made public before.  It was not
  intended to be.  But your tax dollars pay for these devices;  it is
  your right to know about them.
   There is a booklet, written in 1977 and distributed to a select
  group of U.S. mercenaries, titled "<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> Improvised Sabotage
  Devices."  This instructional guidebook, part of "the Combat
  Bookshelf," was published by <ent type='ORG'>Desert Publications</ent>, P.O. Box 22005,
  <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> 85028.  If you want to know how the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> turns a
  cigar box into an explosive that can destroy a 10000-gallon
  capacity storage tank, then "<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Improvised Sabotage Devices</ent>" is
  what you should read.  You will need it if you want to build the
  "Water-Drip Electric Delay," a bomb that requires little more than
  wood scrap, a tin can, and a battery.  The "<ent type='ORG'>Pocket Watch Electric</ent>
  Delay" requires little more than a watch, a screw, and a battery.
  The "Mousetrap Electric Release" is another bomb, this one
  requiring a mousetrap, a trip wire, a battery, and little else.  It
  is described as "an excellent device to use with bazooka rockets
  against trucks, tanks, or locomotives."  The "Chemical
  Instantaneous Initiator" is made from a sugar-chlorate mix and is
  effective in sabotaging trains.  The "Martini Glass Shaped Charge"
  is a bomb that also can be made out of a beer can.  You might want
  to try to construct the "Vehicle Booby Trap."  The "Potassium
  Chlorate and Sugar Igniter" and the "Sawdust, Moth Flakes, and Oil
  Incendiary" can be made with only what you see in their titles.
   For these and more than fifty other <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> devices, step-by-step
  instructions on how to make them and illustrations of what they
  should look like when completed are given.  Turn a wine bottle into
  a bomb.  Build a land-mine rocket.  Manufacture napalm in your
  basement.  Even the simple how-tos of causing a dust explosion can
  be found in "<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Improvised Sabotage Devices</ent>."
   Why is the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> so deeply involved in sabotage techniques?  The
  <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> might think it is in this country's interest to delay
  scientific work being done by another nation.  Or, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> might
  want to disrupt a nation's economy in the hope that the resulting
  chaos will lead to civil unrest and the overthrow of the existing
  government (some of this actually happened in <ent type='GPE'>Chile</ent>).  The original
  John Rockefeller used such tactics against his competitors.  He
  simply had their refineries blown up.
   Another pamphlet the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> would not like you to see is titled
  "How to Kill," written by John Minnery, edited by Robert Brown and
  Peder Lund, and published by <ent type='ORG'>Paladin Press</ent>, Box 1307, <ent type='GPE'>Boulder</ent>,
  <ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent> 80306.  The reason the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> would prefer that you not see
  this eighty-eight-page pamphlet, which is unavailable at bookstores
  and newsstands, is because it contains a number of "ingenious"
  methods of doing what the title says.  Also, <ent type='ORG'>Paladin Press</ent>, which
  published a book called "<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>OSS</ent> Sabotage and Demolition</ent> Manual," is
  widely regarded by journalists as an organization with close ties
  to mercenary groups and the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.  <ent type='ORG'>Paladin Press</ent> doesn't want you to
  know that, but how else could they have published the "<ent type='ORG'>OSS</ent> Sabotage
  and Demolition Manual?"  <ent type='ORG'>The Office of Strategic Services</ent> was the
  precursor of today's <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.
   This writer's call to <ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent> yielded the following
  conversation:</p>

<p>   "How could you publish the "<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>OSS</ent> Sabotage and Demolition</ent> Manual,"
  I asked Peter Lund, editor and publisher of <ent type='ORG'>Paladin Press</ent>, "if your
  organization, at the least, was not dealing with former <ent type='ORG'>OSS</ent> agents?
  And what about "How to Kill?"
   "I don't talk to journalists," Lund said.
   "You're called the <ent type='ORG'>Paladin Press</ent>.  You must publish books.  Can
  I order them?"
   "No."
   "Why not?  You're a publisher, aren't you?"
   "We're afraid our publications might fall into the wrong hands."
   "What are the right hands?" I asked.
   "I don't talk to journalists."
   "Have you ever heard of <ent type='ORG'>Desert Publications</ent>?" I asked.
   "A fine outfit," Lund said.  "If they recommend you, I'll send
  you our material."
   "That's my problem," I said.  "They don't seem to have a phone
  number."
   "Well, they're a good group."
   "Listen," I said, "wasn't your group, and <ent type='ORG'>Desert Publications</ent>
  besides, involved in <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> mercenary activity in <ent type='LOC'>Africa</ent>?"
   "I don't know anything about that."
   "Were you in the Special Forces?"
   "July 1967 to July 1968 in <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>."
   "Were you <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>?"
   "I was MACV [Military Armed Forces Command <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>]."
   "You weren't affiliated with <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>?"
   "I didn't say that."
   "What do you say?"
   "We did joint operations with <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> on the <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent> Program."
   "Wasn't that a murder operation?"
   "No.  It was snatching people."</p>

<p>   The <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent> Program was designed for a job that the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
  euphemistically described as "eliminating the <ent type='GPE'>Viet Cong</ent>
  infrastructure."  In reality, it was a rampant reign of terror run
  out of <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> headquarters at Langley, Virginia.  Former <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> director
  William Colby later termed the program "effective."  The <ent type='GPE'>Phoenix</ent>
  Program was a naked murder campaign, as proved by every realistic
  report, ranging from <ent type='ORG'>the Bertrand Russell Tribunal</ent> to the Dellums
  Committee to admissions by <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agents themselves.  The program
  killed--and *none* of these killings occurred in combat--18000
  people, mostly women and children.
   But what about Peder Lund, editor and publisher of Paladin
  Press?  The book he edited and published, "How to Kill," outlined a
  surfeit of murder methods, horrific techniques of causing people to
  die.  For example:
   "Without getting too deeply into the realm of the bizarre,"
  wrote John Minnery, the author of "How to Kill" as he proceeded to
  just that, "a specially loaded bullet made from a human tooth
  (bicuspid) could be fired under the jaw or through the mouth into
  the head.  The tooth is a very hard bone, and its enamel shell
  would allow it to penetrate into the brain.  The intention here is
  also to hide the cause of death because the examiner in his search
  for a projectile will disregard bone fragments."
   One last example from "How to Kill" should give you the flavor
  of the book:</p>

<p>    Lesson Nine:  Hot Wire</p>

<p>   "Essentially, the weapon is an electrified grid in the urinal
   basin.  This can take the form of a screen cover for the drain 
 or a metal grill.  If the urinal is completely porcelain, the 
 screen must be added by the assassin.  The drain cover is 
 connected to the electrical system of the washroom by means of 
 an insulated cord that is hidden behind the plumbing.
   "What happens when the subject uses the urinal should be 
   obvious now.  The subject's urine, which is a salty liquid and
 a perfect conductor of electricity, makes contact with the 
 charged grid, and the shock will kill him."</p>

<p>   This reporter's investigation revealed that the "Hot Wire" was
  child's play compared to certain other <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> weapons devices.  For
  instance, I was able to obtain Volumes One and Two of the "<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
  Black Book" on improvised munitions, volumes that are stamped "for
  official use only" on almost every page.  It is obvious why the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
  would like these books to remain secret.  With elaborate
  instructions, they describe how to make high explosives from
  aspirin, how to construct a nail grenade, and how to turn a Coke
  bottle into a bomb.
   Described in detail in the "Black Book" is the previously
  mentioned urea nitrate explosive, or, as it is known to the pros,
  "the piss bomb."  Instructions for the preparation of this weapon
  assure the maker that animal urine will do as well as human;  the
  important thing is to have ten cups of it, boil it down to one cup,
  and mix it with the nitric acid.
   Also described in the "Black Book" is how to construct a pipe
  pistol, which, as the name indicates, is a gun constructed out of a
  pipe.  Other weapons include a cooking syringe filled with poison
  that can be stabbed into "the subject's" stomach;  a cyanide gas
  pistol;  a throat cutter gauntlet knife (razor sharp and only an
  inch or so in length);  and a mixture of fertilizer and aluminum
  powder that can be made into a powerful bomb.
   Why build murder weapons out of such weird material?  Is the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
  insane?
   No.  In its own way, the whole thing is perfectly logical.
   The pamphlet "How to Kill" explained it all:  "As most of these
  devices are homemade, this precludes the possibility of their being
  traced.  They are, in effect, `sanitized' and perfect for
  assassinations, where weapons are prohibited, or where customs in
  the hostile country are stringent, so these can be made from local
  materials."
   Being a contract killer for the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> is not all roses.  You
  cannot kill in just any way.  A number of attempts have been made
  on Fidel Castro's life--some with the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>
  cooperating--and some of them may have failed because of
  restrictions imposed on the potential assassins.  It would be
  unacceptable for Castro's murder to be laid at the door of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.
  This would make Castro a martyr in the eyes of his countrymen.
  Thus, a method that would suggest death by natural causes must be
  found.
   Abundant speculation and considerable evidence suggest that the
  <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> or some other government agency arranged for the "natural"
  deaths of David Ferrie, Jack Ruby, George De Mohrenschildt, and
  other potential witnesses into the assassination of John Kennedy.
  Some methods of killing, like the injection of an air bubble into
  the bloodstream, will often go unnoticed by medical examiners.
   Another hard-to-trace method of killing is to mail a snake to
  the victim.  This is known as killing by long distance.  A
  disadvantage to this method is that the snake might bite an
  innocent third party who just happens to open the package.  The
  advantage is that once the snake has struck, the evidence can
  simply slither away.
   Sometimes, as the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> knows, killing has to be done at close
  range.  For this purpose, a valuable weapon is the ice pick with a
  blood arrester attached.  The blood arrester is a cloth wrapped
  near the tip of the ice pick.  When the pick is shoved into the
  victim, the spurting blood is absorbed by the blood arrester.
  People who see the victim fall will probably think he has had a
  heart attack.  While the onlookers try to help the victim, the
  assassin uses this valuable ten or fifteen seconds to escape
  unnoticed.
   Often it is advisable to use what is called in the trade a
  "quiet weapon."  Silenced weapons can include pistols, rifles, and
  even machine guns.
   <ent type='ORG'>Poison</ent> is a quiet killer.  Here is a partial list of the poisons
  the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> has become expert at administering:  oil of bitter almonds;
  ant paste;  cadmium, used in vapor form, and death is delayed four
  hours;  radiator cleaner, also causing a delayed death;
  Cantharides (Spanish Fly);  ethyl mercury;  and freon, heated by a
  flame.  These poisons and many others are listed in "How to Kill."
  The author then cautions the reader:
   "Unless otherwise stated, these poisons are either to be
  injected into the subject, or taken orally by him by adding it to
  his food.  Use common sense in the application of these potions
  and, if possible, double the O.D. necessary."
   W.H. <ent type='ORG'>Bowart</ent>, in his book, "<ent type='ORG'>Operation Mind Control</ent>" described the
  <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>'s use of drugs:  "In 1953, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> made plans to purchase ten
  kilograms of LSD for use in `drug experiments with animals and
  human beings.'  Since there are more than 10000 doses in a gram,
  that meant the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> wanted 100 million doses.  The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> obviously
  intended to `corner the market' on LSD so that other countries
  would not be ahead of the U.S. in their potential for `LSD
  warfare.'"
   Dr. Albert Hoffman, an early researcher into the uses of LSD,
  was horrified by what the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> was doing:  "I had perfected LSD for
  medical use, not as a weapon.  It can make you insane or even kill
  you if it is not properly used under medical supervision.  In any
  case, the research should be done by medical people and not by
  soldiers or intelligence agencies."
   Perhaps the most frightening weapon of all is the one that can
  be used to alter weather and climate.  It was used with
  considerable success in <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>.  It slowed troop movements with
  heavy rains, and it destroyed the rice crop, as well.  The danger
  is that these climatological changes may become permanent,
  affecting not only enemies of <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>, but also the
  entire planet.
   Finally, considerable evidence exists that <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>,
  through the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, employed germ warfare during the Korean War.  A
  number of captured pilots testified that germ warfare was used, but
  their testimony was dismissed as brainwashing.  A <ent type='ORG'>Marine Corps</ent>
  colonel named Frank H. Schwable signed a germ warfare confession
  and, according to W.H. <ent type='ORG'>Bowart</ent>, "named names, cited missions,
  described meetings and strategy conferences."
   Schwable later repudiated his confession.  But the charges of
  germ warfare were taken up in front of the <ent type='ORG'>United Nations</ent>, and a
  number of countries believed them.
   <ent type='GPE'>The United States</ent>, incidentally, was later charged with using
  nerve gas in <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>.
   What you have read on these pages is pretty revolting stuff.
  Yet, if the world ought to be saved from Communism, who can say it
  is not necessary?  One danger, of course, is that these terrible
  weapons have been introduced into our body politic and have
  produced strange and terrible fruits on our own native soil.  When
  assassination becomes government policy, when men are trained to
  kill in every conceivable way, when morality is set aside for a
  "higher good," can even the President of <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> consider
  himself safe?</p>
