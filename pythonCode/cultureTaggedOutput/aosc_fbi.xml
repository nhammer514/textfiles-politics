<p>SYSTEM PROFILE - The FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</p>

<p>History</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> traces its roots back to the year 1908 when then U.S. Attorney General
Charles Bonaparte directed that Department of Justice investigations be handled
by a small group of special investigators. The group was formed as <ent type='ORG'>the Bureau</ent>
of Investigation and, in 1935, the present day name was designated by <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>.</p>

<p>Duties</p>

<p>The primary functions of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> and its agents are the investigations of
violations of certain <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> statutes and the collection of evidence in cases
in which <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> is or may be an interested party. The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> performs
other duties specifically imposed by law or Presidential directive and conducts
a number of service activities for other law enforcement agencies. The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> can
investigate a matter only when it has authority to do so under a law passed by
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> or on instructions of the President or the Attorney General.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> is not a <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> police force, it is a fact-finding organization
investigating violations of <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> laws and its authority is strictly limited
to matters within its jurisdiction. <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> agents may make arrests without a
warrant for any <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> offense committed in their presence, or when they have
reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or
is attempting to commit a felony violation of <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent> laws. Agents may
also make arrests by warrant.</p>

<p>Agents do not make arrests for "investigation" or "on suspicion". Before
arrests are made, if at all possible, the facts of each case are presented tom
the U.S. Attorney who decides whether or not a <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent> violation has occurred
and, if so, the U.S. Attorney may authorize agents to file a complaint which
serves as the basis of the arrest warrant.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> has no authority to investigate local crimes which are not within its
jurisdiction. The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> will, however, render all possible assistance to the
local police through the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> Laboratory and Identification Division. The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>
LID maintains fingerprint files on approximately 70 million (yes, million)
people. The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> also maintains <ent type='ORG'>the National Crime Information Center</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>NCIC</ent>)
which keeps records of missing persons, serialized stolen property, wanted
persons for whom an arrest warrant is outstanding, and criminal histories on
individuals arrested and fingerprinted for serious or significant offenses.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>NCIC</ent> is a computerized information system established by the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> as a
service to all criminal justice agencies- local, state and <ent type='ORG'>Federal</ent>. The
information can be instantly retrieved over a vast communications network
through the use of telecommunications equipment in criminal justice centers in
various locations in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Canada</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Puerto Rico</ent>. Many times when
monitoring the local or county police/sheriff departments a reference to a <ent type='ORG'>NCIC</ent>
check is heard.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> is involved in criminal investigations and foreign counterintelligence
efforts. Most notably criminal investigations are those of bank robberies and
kidnapping cases. The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> can also investigate criminal activity associated
with interstate transportation of stolen property, and the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> can investigate
graft and corruption cases of local government under certain circumstances.
Department of Justice offices mat be found on some military installations as
the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> has jurisdiction when a crime involves Government property, or funds,
or when only civilians are involved.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>'s responsibility with respect to foreign counterintelligence, within
<ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>, is to detect, lawfully counteract, and/or prevent espionage
and other clandestine intelligence activities, sabotage, international
terrorist activities, or assassinations conducted for or on behalf of foreign
powers, organizations, or persons. The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> also investigates murders,
kidnappings, and assaults against foreign diplomatic officials while in the
<ent type='GPE'>United States</ent>, as well as damage to property of foreign governments in the
<ent type='GPE'>United States</ent>.</p>

<p>Organization</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> is an agency within the U.S. Department of Justice, which is lead by
the U.S. Attorney General. The head of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> is the Director who is appointed
by the President with the advice and consent of the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent>. Assistant directors
are the next level of command within the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>. The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> has ten assistant
directors who are accountable to the Director for all matters within their
sphere of operations.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> has 59 field offices located in major cities throughout the United
States and in <ent type='GPE'>San Juan</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Puerto Rico</ent>. Each, with the exception of the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>
Office which is headed by an Assistant Director, is under the direct
supervision of a Special Agent In Charge (<ent type='ORG'>SAIC</ent>). The <ent type='ORG'>SAIC</ent> is supervised and
receives directions from the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> headquarters in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C.</p>

<p>Each <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> Field Office has <ent type='ORG'>Resident Agencies</ent> which are local offices in some of
the larger cities within the field offices jurisdiction. Refer to the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> field
office map for the sectioning of the field offices across <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>.

<p>The list of <ent type='ORG'>Field Offices</ent> and RA's is not 100% accurate, updates please. The
number of RA's may differ from the call letter assignment block for a given
F.O. because many RA's were closed and consolidated during the Carter and early
Regan administrations. The call letters were assigned prior to their
administrations.</p>

<p>The F.O. call letters will be the first is an assigned block for a given F.O.
Example <ent type='GPE'>Cincinnati</ent> F.O. call is <ent type='ORG'>KQC</ent> 390 (or simply 390 as often will be heard)
or <ent type='GPE'>Cleveland</ent> F.O. call is <ent type='ORG'>KEX</ent> 740 (740).</p>

<p>The following is a list of <ent type='ORG'>Resident Agencies</ent> for the primary coverage states of
the <ent type='ORG'>AOSC</ent>. The list is as of 1 October 1987. I will send a copy of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> Field
Office and <ent type='ORG'>Resident Agency</ent> map for a SASE to those who desire a copy. A list of
RA's may be obtained from the map for your local area. The map will be a copy
of a copy, however it will be fairly legible. Note the two <ent type='ORG'>Ohio Field Office</ent>
lists are presented later in this column with the detailed <ent type='GPE'>Ohio</ent> data.</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> F.O. utilizes 8 banks, A through H. Channel banks C through H are not
confirmed to exact frequencies and usage. There are one way links in the upper
162, lower 164 and upper 165 MHz ranges. The one way links are often a control
station to a repeater site utilizing a directional antenna. The one way links
may also be a point-to-point relay of communications from an outer fringe RA to
the F.O.</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> appears to configured similarly as several other F.O.'s in that up to
five other VHF frequencies can be active with 163.9875 simultaneously with the
same radio traffic. <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> F.O. also still uses some remote VHF receive/UHF
re-transmit link sites, but most are believed to be converted to microwave
links.</p>

<p>Also 167.7625 which Randy Strayer and this editor received via skip between <ent type='ORG'>KSC</ent>

<p><ent type='GPE'>CINCINNATI</ent> FIELD OFFICE OPERATIONS</p>

<p>The <ent type='GPE'>Cincinnati</ent> Field Office originally had nine <ent type='ORG'>Resident Agencies</ent> which were
located in <ent type='GPE'>Athens</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Chillicothe</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Columbus</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Dayton</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Hamilton</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Portsmouth</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Springfield</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Steubenville</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Zanesville</ent>. The <ent type='GPE'>Springfield</ent> office is closed and
I am not sure about the <ent type='GPE'>Zanesville</ent> R.A.</p>

<p>The CI F.O. and R.A.'s radio communication systems are DES (Digital Encryption
Standard) capable and are utilized on a regular basis. CI appears to have a 32
channel DES system in place as testing was monitored during 1988 and 1989. Most
of their frequencies remained the same from the previous DES days. Note that
the CI radios are VHF/UHF mobiles. Refer to the B channel series in the
frequency list.</p>

<p>The signal numbers do not appear to be squad base (logically grouping by
general agent function such as bank robbery squad or drug enforcement, or by
R.A.'s), but rather a numeric numbering scheme starting with 1 and into the low
100's.</p>

<p>The CI F.O./R.A. operations still need some work from our southern <ent type='GPE'>Ohio</ent> members
as allot of holes and gaps remain. The following profile on CI was mainly made
possible by the efforts of Bill Gillie, Tony Cono, Rick Poorman, another member
who desires to named Mr. Anonymous, and this editor.</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>CLEVELAND FIELD</ent> OFFICE OPERATIONS</p>

<p>The <ent type='GPE'>Cleveland</ent> Field Office originally had 10 <ent type='ORG'>Resident Agencies</ent> located in

and <ent type='GPE'>Youngstown</ent>. The Mentor R.A. currently is the only R.A. out of service in
the CV division.</p>

<p>The CV F.O. And R.A.'s radio communication system is DES capable and utilized
quite often in the DES mode. The CV F.O. has been in DES since the mid-eighties
on a limited basis and a full system since early 1989. The CV system appears to
be a 64 channel system which was implemented during the latter part of 1989.</p>

<p>The CV division utilizes a squad numbering scheme for assignment of signal

<p><ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> COMMON FREQUENCY RANGES</p>

<p>I suggest searching the following frequency ranges for <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> radio activity. Note
that in many areas across the U.S. the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> have picked up many traditional
non-<ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> frequencies. Originally <ent type='ORG'>the Department</ent> of Justice had only 82 VHf
frequencies assigned for ALL of its members, let alone just the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>. The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>
originally had less than 40 of the 82 frequencies for their exclusive use.</p>

<p>During the change over to DES nationwide, the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> has received additional
frequencies from other branches and departments who did not utilize or need
them. In the NE region the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> received 110 VHF frequencies - almost 300%
increase in the number of frequencies available. The early days saw the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> in
the 163 MHz range for repeaters and the 167 MHz range for simplex operations.</p>

<p>Limit your search to 500 KHz at a time, certainly no more than a 1 MHz. The

<p>FEDERAL NEWS - <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent></p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>FCC</ent> has established a nationwide radio frequency for stolen vehicle
tracking systems operating on the frequency of 173.025. The frequency was
reported as a <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> assignment (wouldn't we like to see the exact frequency
assignment chart?) <ent type='ORG'>Nationwide</ent>. Perhaps this frequency was used for wireless
microphones or bugs, and if so perhaps others operate on nearby similar
frequencies. Give it a listen and let us know.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> Academy, located 40 miles south of <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, is the host to the most
crime ridden town in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> - Hogan's <ent type='ORG'>Alley</ent>. Hogan's <ent type='ORG'>Alley</ent> is a
"<ent type='GPE'>Hollywood</ent>" town with a motel, bank, post office, drug store, laundry and even
a theater. It is used as a training ground for <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> agent trainees. Various
scenarios are enacted under the careful eyes of supervisors. The trainees
performance are evaluated with each exercise.</p>

<p>One thing about Hogan's <ent type='ORG'>Alley</ent> - it has a 100% success rate in solving of cases,
pretty impressive. Something that is not pretty impressive about the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> is the
starting pay agents earn. According to a 8 January 1990 U.S. News and World
Report quirk the starting pay of a <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> agent is $26261. Consider that an agent
does not choice his assignment location, the agent could be placed in a very
high cost of living area. Placement in certain cities such as <ent type='GPE'>NYC</ent> offer
slightly more pay, however it is not enough for the work that they perform for
all of us. Yet even worse is the pay for <ent type='ORG'>DEA</ent> agents $19493 to $23846.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> is aware of these low salaries (after all they, the <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>men
and Senators literally took care of themselves) and will hopefully rectify the
problem this year.
