<p>The following extract is submitted to resurrect long
forgotten material concerning the assassination of Robert F,
Kennedy.  The evidence for conspiracy that it presents,
regarding the assassination, speaks for itself.  I do not
necessarily agree that there was a second conspiracy to
cover it up, as does the cited source.  I believe, rather,
that the obscurity of the material is a classic
manifestation of <ent type='ORG'>Collective Denial</ent>, resulting in the
seemingly irrational appearance of secondary suppression
suggested here.  As an example of <ent type='ORG'>Collective Denial</ent> by
investigators, and the press, content versus coverage leaves
no other logical analysis.  The evidence was Too Bad to be
True, and therefore "invisible" in the most literal sense.
The most important aspect of the article may well be its
demonstration of the power of clinical <ent type='ORG'>Collective Denial</ent>.
That there was something to Deny is clearly stated.</p>

important <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> leaders in our times is of the utmost
significance to every <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> - and especially to computer
people, because computers can be used: to handle large
amounts of information easily; to correlate the information
rapidly; to prove or disprove or possibilities of
conspiracy; etc.  Therefore, computer people can make a
unique and important contribution to society in this area.

 "Accordingly, _Computers and Automation_ is publishing
from time to time articles and reports on investigations

important, useful, and authoritative information in order

<p>  "<ent type='ORG'>THE CONSPIRACY TO ASSASSINATE SENATOR</ent>
  ROBERT F. KENNEDY AND THE SECOND CONSPIRACY
    TO COVER IT UP</p>

<p>   "Richard E. Sprague,
   Hartsdale, N.Y.</p>

<p>  "In June 1970, a group action suit was filed in Los
Angeles on behalf of all the residents of the State of
<ent type='GPE'>California</ent> by Theodore Charach, a free-lance journalist, to
force <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent> Police Department</ent> to make public
additional information in their possession relating to a
possible conspiracy in the assassination of Senator Robert
F. Kennedy in June 1958...
 "...The Charach suit...claims that another man also fired
shots, and that it was likely that he, not Sirhan, was the
killer.  Charach, and his lawyer, Godfrey Isaac, held a
press conference on Thursday, June 4, 1970, in <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent>
to announce the filing of the suit and its withdrawal.  The
withdrawal was made so that the defendants would have an
opportunity to assess all of Charach's findings.
 "The only news organization apparently that this story
was the _<ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent> Free Press_ (7813 Beverly Blvd., Los
Angeles, <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>, 90036 [in 1970] in their June 12-18,
1970, issue.  The news of this suit was not published in
any other of the <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent> papers, nor distributed by the
Associated Press, <ent type='ORG'>United Press International</ent>, or <ent type='ORG'>Reuters</ent>,
nor published in the _New York Times_, nor published or
broadcast by many other important new media...</p>

<p>    "STATEMENTS IN THE CHARACH SUIT</p>

<p> "The assassin that is suggested in the suit of Theodore
Charach was a uniformed security guard employed on a
contract basis by <ent type='ORG'>the Ambassador Hotel</ent> to guard Senator
Kennedy. His name is Thane Eugene Cesar, a part time
employee, at the time, of <ent type='ORG'>the Ace Security Guard Service</ent> in
<ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent>, and a known right-wing supporter of George
Wallace and hater of the Kennedys'.</p>

<p> "Cesar's name is mentioned in a book and in an article,
both by Robert Blair Kaiser. The book is to be published in
the fall of 1970.  The article was published in "LADIES HOME
JOURNAL" magazine in May 1970 and is entitled "<ent type='ORG'>RFK</ent> Must
Die." Cesar is quoted in the article as saying he did draw
his service revolver at the time Kennedy was hit, but
replaced it in his holster because Sirhan was by then under
control.</p>

<p> "Charach's suit  says that <ent type='ORG'>District</ent> Attorney Evelle
Younger, Chief of Police Edward M. Davis, and Deputy Chief
Robert A. <ent type='GPE'>Houghton</ent> (also author of the book "Special Unit
Senator" on the assassination published 1970 by Random
House) have all purposely concealed from the people of
<ent type='GPE'>California</ent>, without the legal right to do so, the following
alleged facts:</p>

<p>   "1.  Senator Robert F. Kennedy was NOT killed by a
 bullet from the gun of Sirhan B. Sirhan.</p>

<p>   "2. Another gun was fired at <ent type='ORG'>RFK</ent> at the same time.</p>

<p>   "3.  The fatal shot did not come from the direction
 of Sirhan's position.</p>

<p>   "4. A witness, Donald <ent type='ORG'>Schulman</ent>, an employee of <ent type='ORG'>KNX</ent>-
 TV,  SAW Cesar fire his gun while standing directly
 behind Senator Kennedy.  <ent type='ORG'>Schulman</ent> saw Kennedy being hit
 from behind by three bullets. <ent type='ORG'>Schulman</ent> was interviewed
 about what he saw within minutes after the assassination;
 but he was not called as a witness at Sirhan's trial; nor
 was he mentioned in <ent type='ORG'>Evelle Younger</ent>'s report to the people
 of <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>; nor was he mentioned in <ent type='GPE'>Houghton</ent>'s book,
 'Special Unit Senator.'...</p>

<p>   "5.  Karl <ent type='ORG'>Uecker</ent>, the maitre d' who was escorting
 Senator Kennedy through the pantry where he was shot, saw
 Cesar with his drawn gun in his hand, immediately after
 <ent type='ORG'>Uecker</ent> helped  subdue Sirhan.  Younger, Davis, and
 <ent type='GPE'>Houghton</ent> (asserts Charach) did not present this evidence
 to the jury or at the Sirhan trial.</p>

<p>   "6.  Cesar's presence in the pantry, his possession
 of a gun, his drawing of the gun from his holster, and
 his close  proximity to  Kennedy's back  were  all
 suppressed. Cesar was never called to testify before the
 grand jury or at the trial. (<ent type='GPE'>Houghton</ent>'s book even states
 that there were NO security guards at the doors or in the
 kitchen at the time of the shooting, and that NO persons
 of right wing connections were in the pantry; this is
 simply not true.)</p>

<p>   "7.  The facts determined at the autopsy by Dr.
 Thomas T. Noguchi, coroner, were glossed over, changed,
 or not allowed to be presented before the grand jury or
 at the trial.</p>

<p>   "8. One of these facts was that the fatal wound was
 caused by a bullet in the head, the trajectory of which
 was back to front, right to left, and upward. Sirhan WAS
 NEVER in a position to have fired on that trajectory.
 Cesar WAS.</p>

<p>   "9.  A second of these facts was that the fatal
 wound was inflicted from a distance of one inch to three
 inches, while two other wounds fired from the rear were
 inflicted from a distance of less than six inches away.
 Sirhan was never closer to Kennedy than several feet
 away. Cesar was right behind him and to his right.</p>

<p>   "10.  Dr. Noguchi started to testify about the
 wounds at the Sirhan trial, but was stopped by the judge.</p>

<p>   "OTHER EVIDENCE</p>

<div> "....</div>

<p>  "The Sounds of Three Shots Recorded on Tape</p>

<p> "Several TV and radio network microphones were open and
operating during  the shooting.  They were all in the
Ambassador Ballroom, quite a distance from the pantry. One
of these microphones, attached to an <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Broadcasting
Corp. TV camera, produced a live and video tape recording of
the event.  Researchers in <ent type='GPE'>New York City</ent> have examined this
tape and found that only THREE shots can be heard above the
noise of the crowd.
 "The microphone was continuously open from the time
Kennedy left the podium until all the shots had been fired
and for some time beyond that. The TV video tape with sound
shows that there were no breaks in either picture or
sound...
 "Now, the fact that ONLY THREE shots can be heard
confirms the probability that more than one gun was being
fired, and that shots from a second gun are those recorded
on the tape.  Sirhan's gun shots were apparently not loud
enough to be recorded.  If they had been, all eight of his
shots should have been audible also."</p>

<p>(NOTE: Sirhan was firing a .22. Cesar had a service
revolver).</p>

<p>  "SOUND TEST BY THE LOS ANGELES POLICE</p>

<p> "Confirmation of the evidence that Sirhan's gun could not
have been heard above the crowd noise from the position of
the <ent type='ORG'>ABC</ent> microphone is presented on pages 118-119 of "Special
Unit Senator," <ent type='GPE'>Houghton</ent>'s  book.  Unwittingly, thus,
<ent type='GPE'>Houghton</ent> presents evidence of a second presents evidence of
a second gun, whereas he had intended the evidence to help
prove there was no conspiracy.
 "The following is quoted from the book:</p>

<p>  "The next day, June 20, Pena [L.A. Police Lt.
   Manny Pena]  ordered sound  level tests to be
   conducted at the Ambassador to determine whether a
   gun fired in the pantry could be heard by the stairs
   outside the opposite end of the Embassy Room. The
   two locations were approximately a hundred yards,
   and many walls, drapes and doors apart.
  "Officer DeWayne Wolfer conducted the sound
   tests at the hotel between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.
   when...there was no talking, shouting, or music to
   deaden the sounds of the shots... "</p>

<p>(<ent type='GPE'>Houghton</ent>'s text, as quoted by COMPUTERS AND AUTOMATION,
goes on to give technical details of the test, how the
ammunition and firing position was duplicated, etc.,
particularly noting measurements taken at the location from
which Sandra Serrano, a Kennedy worker, claimed to have
heard the shots).</p>

<p>  "...registered no greater change than one half
   decibel during ANY of the tests. ...The minimum
   change in noise level discernible for people with
   normal hearing is two decibels...
  "She [Sandra Serrano] obviously thought, in the
   furor of the moment, that she heard and saw certain
   things which were not physically possible or did not
   actually occur. It happens every day. ...People ...
   hear something which cannot be detected by the most
   sensitive electronic device.</p>

<p> "Now <ent type='GPE'>Houghton</ent> is right on one count; Miss Serrano did not
hear the shots from Sirhan's gun... What she did hear,
however, was the sound of a second gun firing three shots...
 "Also, the crowd noise was present. Nearly everyone in
the ballroom interviewed heard a few shoots.  Why wouldn't
they, if the microphones 300 to 400 feet away on the podium
recorded the three shots?
 "In this way, <ent type='GPE'>Houghton</ent>, in an effort to invalidate Miss
Serrano's report, unwittingly produced just the right test
to prove that a gun, not Sirhan's but a second gun, was
firing."</p>

<p> "SECRECY OVER THE <ent type='ORG'>RFK</ent> AUTOPSY REPORT</p>

<p> "The reports on the autopsy of Senator Robert F. Kennedy
have been suppressed in three separate ways: first, by the
judge's ruling before the trial of Sirhan; second, by
attempts to silence the coroner, Dr. Thomas Noguchi, by
intimidation; and third, by passing a special <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> law
making the autopsy reports secret for 75 years.
 "The attempts to intimidate Dr. Noguchi are like a scene
out of the movie "Z". After he told in public the results of
the autopsy, he was accused of being insane and fired. He
took the issue to court and won a victory, when his lawyer,
Godfrey Isaac threatened to subpoena the autopsy and
introduce it in court.  Then the <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent> Police Dept.
rehired Noguchi.</p>

<p>    "SUMMARY</p>

<p> "To summarize, the officials of the <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent> Police
Department have been and still are suppressing important
evidence about the <ent type='ORG'>RFK</ent> assassination.  This evidence points
toward a conspiracy, with Sirhan being a patsy, toward a
hotel security guard firing the three shots which hit
<ent type='ORG'>RFK</ent>..."</p>
