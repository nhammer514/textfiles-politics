<p>THE INFLUENCE OF <ent type='ORG'>VEDIC</ent> PHILOSOPHY ON NIKOLA TESLA'S UNSTANDIING FREE ENERGY</p>

<p>  "The first thing to realize about the ether is its  absolute
   continuity.  A  deep  sea  fish  has  probably  no  means  of
   apprehending  the existence  of water; it is too  uniformly
   immersed in it: and that is our  condition  in regard to  the
   ether."
   Sir Oliver Lodge, Ether and Reality.</p>

<p>   ABSTRACT</p>

<p>  Nikola <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> used ancient Sanskrit terminology in his descriptions of
  natural phenomena.  As early as 1891 <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> described the universe as  a
  kinetic  system  filled  with energy which could be  harnessed  at  any
  location. His  concepts  during  the  following  years  were  greatly
  influenced  by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda. Swami  Vivekananda
  was  the  first  of a succession of eastern yogi's  who  brought  <ent type='NORP'>Vedic</ent>
  philosophy and religion to the west.  After meeting the Swami and after
  continued  study  of  the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>East</ent>ern</ent> view of the  mechanisms  driving  the
  material world, <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> began using the Sanskrit words Akasha, Prana, and
  the  concept of a luminiferous ether to describe the source,  existence
  and  construction of matter.  This paper will trace the development  of
  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>'s  understanding of <ent type='ORG'><ent type='NORP'>Vedic</ent> Science</ent>, his correspondence  with  Lord
  Kelvin  concerning  these matters, and the relation between  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>  and
  Walter  Russell  and other turn of the  century  scientists  concerning
  advanced  understanding of physics.  Finally, after being obscured  for
  many  years, the author will give a description of what he believes  is
  the the pre-requisite for the free energy systems envisioned by <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> .</p>

<p>   TESLA'S EARLIER DESCRIPTION OF THE PHYSI<ent type='GPE'>CA</ent>L UNIVERSE</p>

<p>  By  the  year 1891, Nikola <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> had invented  many  useful  devices.
  These included a system of arc lighting (1886), the alternating current
  motor,  power  generation and transmission systems (1888),  systems  of
  electrical  conversion  and  distribution  by  oscillatory discharges
  (1889),  and a generator of high frequency currents (1890), to  name  a
  few. The  most well known patent centers around an  inspiration  that
  occurred while walking with a friend in a park in <ent type='GPE'>Budapest</ent>, Hungry.  It
  was while observing the sunset that <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> had a vision of how  rotating
  electromagnetic  fields could be used in a new form of electric  motor.
  This  led  to  the  well  known  system  of  alternating current power
  distribution.  In 1891 however, <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> patented what one day may  become
  his  most  famous  invention. It  is  the  basis  for  the wireless
  transmission  of  electrical  power  and is  know  as  the  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>  Coil
  Transformer. It  was during this year that <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> made  the  following
  comments  during a speech before the American Institute  of  Electrical</p>

<p>  Engineers;</p>

<p>  "Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be driven  by
   a  power obtainable at any point in the universe.  This  idea
   is  not  novel... We  find  it in the  delightful  myth  of
   Antheus, who derives power from  the  earth; we find it among
   the subtle speculations of one of your splendid
   mathematicians... Throughout space there is  energy. Is
   this  energy static or kinetic.?  If static our hopes are  in
   vain;  if kinetic -  and this  we know it is, for  certain  -
   then it is a mere question  of  time when  men  will  succeed
   in  attaching  their  machinery  to  the  very  wheelwork  of
   nature."  1</p>

<p>  This description of the physical mechanisms of the universe was given
  before  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>  became familiar with the <ent type='NORP'>Vedic</ent> science  of  the  eastern
  <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Nations</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>India</ent></ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Tibet</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Nepal</ent>.  This science was first  popualized
  in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> and the west during the three year visit of Swami
  Vivekananda.</p>

<p>    <ent type='ORG'>VEDIC</ent> SCIENCE AND <ent type='ORG'>SWAMI</ent> VIVEKANANDA</p>

<p>  The Vedas are a collection of writings consisting of hymns,  prayers,
  myths, historical accounting, dissertations on science, and the  nature
  of  reality,  which  date back at least 5000  years. The  nature  of
  matter,  antimatter, and the make up of atomic structure are  described
  in  the  Vedas.  The language of the Vedas is known as  Sanskrit. The
  origin  of Sanskrit is not fully understood.  Western scholars  suggest
  that  it was brought into the <ent type='LOC'>Himalayas</ent> and thence south into <ent type='GPE'>India</ent>  by
  the  southward migrations of the <ent type='NORP'>Aryan</ent> culture.  Paramahansa  Yogananda
  and other historians however  do not subscribe to that theory, pointing
  out  that  there  is  no evidence within  <ent type='GPE'>India</ent>  to  substantiate  such
  claims. 2</p>

<p>  There are words in Sanskrit that describe concepts totally foreign to
  the  western  mind. Single words may require  a  full  paragraph  for
  translation  into english.  Having studied Sanskrit for a brief  period
  during  the late 70's, it finally occurred to this writer that  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>'s
  use of <ent type='NORP'>Vedic</ent> terminology could provide a key to understanding his  view
  of  electromagnetism  and the nature of the universe. But  where  did
  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>  learn <ent type='NORP'>Vedic</ent> concepts and Sanskrit terminology?  A review of  the
  well  known biographies by Cheney, Hunt and Draper, and  O'Neil  345,
  reveal  no  mention of <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>'s knowledge of Sanskrit. O'Neal  however
  includes the following excerpt from an unpublished article called Man's
  Greatest Achievement;</p>

<p>  "There manifests itself in the fully developed being ,  Man,
   a desire   mysterious, inscrutable and  irresistible:  to
   imitate  nature, to create, to  work himself the  wonders  he
   perceives....  Long ago he recognized  that all
   perceptible  matter  comes  from  a  primary  substance, or
   tenuity  beyond conception, filling all space, the Akasha  or
   luminiferous ether, which is acted upon by the life  giving</p>

<p>   Prana  or creative force, calling into  existence,  in  never
   ending  cycles  all  things  and  phenomena.  The primary
   substance,  thrown  into  infinitesimal  whirls  of
   prodigious velocity,  becomes  gross  matter; the force
   subsiding, the  motion ceases  and matter disappears,
   reverting to the primary substance."
  According  to  Leland Anderson the article was  written  May  13th,
  1907. Anderson  also suggested that it was through  association  with
  Swami  Vivekananda that <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> may have come into contact with  Sanskrit
  terminology  and  that  John  Dobson  of  the  San  Francisco  Sidewalk
  Astronomers Association had researched that association. 6</p>

<p>  Swami  Vivekananda  was  born in <ent type='GPE'>Calcutta</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>India</ent>  in  1863. He  was
  inspired by  his  teacher,  Ramakrishna  to  serve  men  as visible
  manifestations  of God.  In 1893 Swami Vivekananda began a tour of  the
  west by attending <ent type='ORG'>the Parliament of Religions</ent> held in <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>. During
  the  three  years  that  he  toured  the  United  States  and <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>,
  Vivekananda  met  with many of the well known scientists  of  the  time
  including  Lord  Kelvin  and  Nikola  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>.  7 According  to Swami
  <ent type='ORG'>Nikhilananda</ent>;</p>

<p>   Nikola  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>, the great scientist who specialized  in  the
   field  of  electricity, was much impressed to hear  from  the
   Swami his explanation of the Samkhya cosmogony and the theory
   of cycles given by the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Hindu</ent>s</ent>.  He was particularly struck by
   the  resemblance  between the Samkhya theory  of  matter  and
   energy and that of modern physics.  The Swami also met in New
   York  Sir  William  <ent type='ORG'>Thompson</ent>,  afterwards  Lord  Kelvin,  and
   Professor  Helmholtz, two leading representatives of  western
   science. Sarah Bernhardt, the famous <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> actress had  an
   interview with the Swami and greatly admired his teachings. 8</p>

<p>  It was at a party given by Sarah Bernhardt that Nikola <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> probably
  first met Swami Vivekananda. 9  Sarah Bernhardt was playing the part of
  '<ent type='ORG'>Iziel</ent>' in a play of the same name.  It was a <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> version about  the
  life  of  Bhudda. The actress upon seeing Swami  Vivekananda  in  the
  audience,  arranged a meeting which was also attended by Nikola  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>.
  In  a letter to a friend, dated February 13th, 1896, Swami  Vivekananda
  noted the following;</p>

<p>   ...Mr.  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> was charmed to hear about the Vedantic  Prana
   and  Akasha  and the Kalpas, which according to him  are  the
   only  theories  modern  science  can  entertain.....Mr  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>
   thinks he can demonstrate that mathematically that force  and
   matter are reducible to potential energy.  I am to go see him
   next week to get this mathematical demonstration. 10</p>

<p>  Swami  Vivekananda was hopeful that <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> would be able to show  that
  what  we  call  matter is simply potential energy  because  that  would
  reconcile  the teachings of the Vedas with modern science. The  Swami
  realized  that "In that case, the Vedantic cosmology [would] be  placed
  on  the surest of foundations".  The harmony between Vedantic  theories
  and and western science was explained by the following diagram;</p>

<p>   BRAHMAN  =  THE ABSOLUTE
    |    |
    |    |
  <ent type='ORG'>MAHAT</ent> OR <ent type='ORG'>ISHVARA</ent>  =  PRIMAL CREATIVE ENERGY
    |    |
   +---------+    +---------+
   PRANA and AKASHA   =  ENERGY and MATTER</p>

<p>  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>  understood the Sanskrit terminology and philosophy  and  found
  that  it  was a good means to describe the physical mechanisms  of  the
  universe  as seen through his eyes.  It would behoove those  who  would
  attempt to understand the science behind the inventions of Nikola <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>
  to study Sanskrit and <ent type='NORP'>Vedic</ent> philosophy.</p>

<p>  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>  apparently failed to show the identity of energy  and  matter.
  If  he  had,  certainly  Swami Vivekananda  would  have  recorded  that
  occasion.  The  mathematical proof of the principle  did  come  until
  about  ten  years  later when Albert Einstein published  his  paper  on
  relativity. What had been known in the <ent type='LOC'>East</ent> for the last 5000  years
  was then known to the West.</p>

<p>  Brahman  is defined as the one self existent impersonal  spirit;  the
  Divine  Essence,  from  which all things emanate,  by  which  they  are
  sustained, and to which they return.  Notice that this is very  similar
  to  the  concept of the Great Spirit as understood by  Native  American
  cultures.  Ishvara  is  the  Supreme  Ruler;  the  highest possible
  conception  of the <ent type='ORG'>Absolute</ent>, which is beyond all thought.  Mahat  means
  literally  the Great One, and is also interpreted as meaning  universal
  mind or cosmic intelligence.  Prana means energy (usually translated as
  life  force)  and Akasha means matter (usually  translated  as  ether).
  Dobson  points  out that the more common translations  for  Akasha  and
  Prana  are not quite correct, but that <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> did understand their  true
  meanings.</p>

<p>  The meeting with Swami Vivekananda greatly stimulated Nikola  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>'s
  interest in <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>East</ent>ern</ent> Science.  The Swami later remarked during a lecture
  in <ent type='GPE'>India</ent>, "I myself have been told by some of the best scientific minds
  of  the  day, how wonderfully rational the conclusions of  the  <ent type='ORG'>Vedanta</ent>
  are. I know of one of them personally, who scarcely has time  to  eat
  his meal, or go out of his laboratory, but who would stand by the  hour
  to attend my lectures on the <ent type='ORG'>Vedanta</ent>; for, as he expresses it, they are
  so  scientific, they so exactly harmonize with the aspirations  of  the
  age  and with the conclusions to which modern science is coming at  the
  present time". 11</p>

<p>    TESLA AND LORD KELVIN</p>

<p>  William S. <ent type='ORG'>Thompson</ent> was one of the prominent scientists and engineers
  of the 1800s.  He developed analogies between heat and electricity  and
  his work influenced the theories developed by James Clerk Maxwell,  one
  of  the  founders of electromagnetic theory.  <ent type='ORG'>Thompson</ent>  supervised  the
  successful  laying  of <ent type='ORG'>the Trans <ent type='LOC'>Atlantic</ent> Cable</ent> and for that  work  was
  knighted Lord Kelvin. Kelvin had endorsed <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>'s theories and proposed
  system for the wireless transmission of electrical power. 12  FootNOTE-
  <ent type='ORG'>Grotz</ent> PACE</p>

<p>  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>  continued to study <ent type='NORP'>Hindu</ent> and <ent type='NORP'>Vedic</ent> philosophy for a number  of
  years  as  indicated  by the following letter written to  him  by  Lord
  Kelvin.</p>

<p>      15, Eaton Place
      <ent type='GPE'>London</ent>, S.W.
      May 20, 1902</p>

<p>   Dear Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>,</p>

<p>  I  do not know how I can ever thank you enough  for  the
   most kind letter of May, 10, which I found in my cabin in the
   <ent type='GPE'>Lucania</ent>, with the beautiful books which you most kindly  sent
   me  along  with  it: -"The Buried  Temple",  "The  Gospel  of
   Bhudda",  Les  Grands  Inities",  the  exquisite  edition  of
   <ent type='ORG'>Rossetti</ent>'s  "House  of  Life", and last but not  least  the
   Century  Magazine  for  June,  1900  with  the  splendid  and
   marvelous photographs on pp. 176, 187, 190, 191, 192, full of
   electrical lessons.</p>

<p>    We had a most beautiful passage across the <ent type='LOC'>Atlantic</ent>,  much
   the finest I have ever had.  I was trying hard nearly all the
   way, but quite unsuccessfully, to find something definite  as
   to the functions of ether in respect to plain, old  fashioned
   magnetism.  A  propos  of  this,  I  have  instructed the
   publishers,  Messrs. Macmillan, to send you at the Waldorf  a
   copy of  my  book  (Collection  of  Separate Papers) on
   <ent type='ORG'>Electrostatics</ent>  and Magnetism.  I shall be glad if  you  will
   accept it from me as a very small mark of my gratitude to you
   for your  kindness. You  may  possibly find something
   interesting in the articles on <ent type='ORG'>Atmospheric Electricity</ent>  which
   it contains.</p>

<p>    Lady Kelvin joins me in kind regards, and I remain,</p>

<p>    Yours always truly,</p>

<p>       Kelvin</p>

<p>   Thank you also warmly for the beautiful flowers  13</p>

<p>   TESLA AND RUSSELL</p>

<p>  Walter  Russell was one of the most accomplished artists,  sculptors,
  writers  and  scientists of this century.  His periodic  chart  of  the
  elements accurately predicted the location and characteristics of  four
  elements years before they were discovered in laboratories.  These  are
  now  known  as Deuterium, Tritium, Neptunium, and  Plutonium. Russell</p>

<p>  apparently  entered  into a heightened state of awareness  after  being
  struck  by  lightning.  He began several weeks of drawing  and  writing
  about the basic nature and make up of the physical universe.  <ent type='ORG'>Russells</ent>'
  family finally called the family doctor to determine if Russell  should
  be  committed  to an mental institution.  The doctor, upon  seeing  the
  results  of  <ent type='ORG'>Russells</ent>  weeks of work, said that he did  not  know  what
  Russell was doing, but that he definitely was not mad.</p>

<p>  Although  the  exact time and occasion of their meeting has  not  yet
  been  determined, Nikola <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> and Walter Russell did meet and  discuss
  their respective cosmologies. 14 <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> recognized the wisdom and  power
  of  <ent type='ORG'>Russells</ent>' teaching and urged Russell to lock up his knowledge in  a
  safe for 1000 years until man was ready for it.  15</p>

<p>    WHY FREE ENERGY HASN'T HAPPENED YET</p>

<p>   COMMENTS, POSSIBILITIES AND SOCIO ECONOMIC IMPLI<ent type='GPE'>CA</ent>TIONS</p>

<p>  Although  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> did not accept many of the tenants of relativity  and
  quantum  theory and  never made the  connection  between  matter  and
  energy,  he did recognize the possibility of free and unlimited  energy
  as demonstrated by the following statement.</p>

<p>  Can Man control [the ] grandest, most awe inspiring of all  processes
  in nature?...If he could do this, he would have powers almost unlimited
  and  supernatural... He could cause planes to collide and  produce  his
  suns  and  stars, his heat and light.  He could originate  and  develop
  life in all its infinite forms....[Such powers] would place him  beside
  his creator, make him fulfill his ultimate destiny.  16</p>

<p>  We see that <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> is asking a question, speculating, searching for an
  answer. If <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> had developed free energy sources or learned how  to
  manipulate  space time and gravity, during the time of his most  public
  and productive years, (up until about 1920), he would have had  answers
  to those questions.</p>

<p>  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>'s most misunderstood invention is popularly known as the "Death
  Ray". It was simply a particle beam weapon which he proposed in  1937
  and was fabricated under contracts with <ent type='ORG'>Alcoa Aluminum</ent> and the  English
  and <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent>  governments. 17  It  used electrostatic propulsion
  techniques  and  similar  devices  are being  developed  today  by  the
  Strategic  Defense  Initiative  Organization (SDIO)  and  the  US  Army
  Strategic Defense Command.  18</p>

<p>  So  we see that mankind has not yet harnessed the infinite  power  of
  the universe as envisioned by Nikola <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>.  The question remains,  why
  not?</p>

<p>  Free  energy  devices, if they are feasible, are  not  about  smaller
  faster  microcircuits  or  a  bigger better mouse  traps. This  is  a
  technology  which  may revolutionize the socio-economic status  quo  on
  planet  <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent>. At this moment the big pie is unevenly  divided. One
  quarter  of the population on this rock, the third stone from the  sun,
  consumes  three  quarters of the yearly resource output. As  one  can
  easily  deduce,  from a brief study of world affairs, there  are  about</p>

<p>  three  billion  people who have just about had it with  this  scenario.
  There  are wars starvation and strife in every nook and cranny  of  the
  planet. So what do we do about it?</p>

<p>  Spaceship <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent> Needs A Flight Plan</p>

<p>  Either we divide the pie more evenly or we make the pie larger. The
  first option requires that our standard of living must fall so that the
  standard  of  living in the third world may rise. The  second  option
  allows  us to maintain our standard of living while we help  raise  the
  standard  of living of under privileged nations.  This we must do. It
  is our destiny. It is our responsibility.  It is our final test.</p>

<p>  Thirty thousand people starve to death every day on this planet, most
  of them are children.  <ent type='ORG'>Nations</ent> fight nations, war is part of our lives.
  What drives our economy in the western world, allows us to enjoy a high
  standard  of living, a life of leisure compared to our neighbors  south
  of  the  imaginary line called a border?  Many answers  both  economic,
  social,  political,  and spiritual can be given.  We do know  that  the
  standard  of  living that a nation enjoys is  directly  related  energy
  consumption.</p>

<p>  <ent type='ORG'>Energy</ent> drives the economies of nations and <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>'s life long goal was
  to  make  electric power equally available to all people any  where  on
  this  planet. He  continued  to promote his  plan  for  the  wireless
  transmission of power in the yearly interviews he gave on his  birthday
  as late as 1940.  19  Electrical power allows on site processing of raw
  materials. Electrical power can run pumps from water wells  in  areas
  affected  by  drought. Electrical  power  delivered  to  the  poverty
  stricken  areas  of the world can make the pie larger, can  help  bring
  about the needed economic equality which is our birth right.</p>

<p>  Why  hasn't  power  been made equally available  to  all  people  and
  nations?  Why haven't the much touted free energy devices described  by
  Tom Bearden, John Bedini, Bruce DePalma, and others ever  materialized?
  Perhaps  because "easy things are seldom done for the same reason  that
  impossible  things  are  rarely  done: no one  will  pay  for  anything
  believed  to be easy or impossible".  20  Perhaps because when we  talk
  about  power  there is more there than one would  initially  visualize.
  What we are talking about is personal power, national power,  planetary
  power, karmic power and the power of love.</p>

<p>  The  sages tell us that in order to enjoy power we have to let go  of
  power,  to overcome ourselves.  As an example this author can  describe
  one  of  his  recent experiences.  After a  very  successful  symposium
  celebrating  the  100th year after Nikola <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> arrived in  the  United
  States 21, a non profit corporation, 501(c)(3), was formed specifically
  to encourage and pursue research into the inventions and discoveries of
  Nikola  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>.  Two years later, after a second symposium,  several  of
  the founding members approached the board of directors with a  proposal
  to  validate  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>'s  claim that wireless transmission  of  power  was
  possible.  <ent type='ORG'>Board</ent> members suggested that permission be obtained from the
  <ent type='ORG'>FCC</ent>,  an environmental impact statement be filed with the <ent type='ORG'>EPA</ent>,  and  we
  should  go  form  "our own non profit corporation". 22  It  was  also
  decided  that  since  there was no procedure  to  cover  research,  the</p>

<p>  organization could not be involved.</p>

<p>  Another goal of the organization had been to establish a museum to be
  named  the Nikola <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> Museum of Science and Technology.  We  proposed
  that  since  60  -70  billion dollars are  given  away  to  non  profit
  organizations  annually,  we  had  as  good  a  chance  as  any other
  organization  for  obtaining  funding, for a museum  or  research. We
  reasoned that:</p>

<p>   "Since  only  16%  of  the museums in  this  country  are  science
  museums,  this  museum in honor of Nikola <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> will help  educate  the
  public in technological  areas. With  the need for economic
  revitalization  of  industry  in <ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent>, 1986is  the  time  to  begin
  supporting  the scientific education of our region.  With  the  current
  statistics  showing that <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> is falling behind the  world
  technologically,  the  effort to educate the public  is  becoming  more
  important,  and  the  surge  of  public  awareness  of  Nikola  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>'s
  inventions  makes  him  an  appropriate  namesake  for  a  science  and
  technology museum."  23</p>

<p>  The board moved to table our proposal indefinitely.</p>

<p>  What  had  happened? Of the 15 - 20 people  that  had  started  the
  organization  only four remained as part of the governing body. Three
  of those members were opposed to research.  The collective mind of  the
  board of directors had become the antithesis of the momentum <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>  had
  gained in  his  lifetime. Unlike  the  independent inventor and
  businessman, the board was now composed of members who were bureaucrats
  and  paper pushers for Fortune 500 companies.  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> was a  vegetarian,
  the board members all ate meat.  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> did not ask for permission to be
  inventive  and  strike  out on bold new adventures,  the  board  needed
  approval from higher sources.  The dichotomies were endless.</p>

<p>  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>'s  visions  have  been delayed for 89  years. The  squabbling
  started with Thomas Edison, J.P. Morgan and Nikola <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> himself. 24 It
  continues  to this day.  Perhaps the reason for the delay  of  wireless
  power  transmission or free energy devices lies even deeper within  the
  human psyche.  Is it possible that we could compare the <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> story  to
  a  biblical  story? Bruce Gordan thinks  so. In  Gordan's  analysis
  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>'s attempt  at  building  a  prototype  magnifying transmitter
  parallels <ent type='ORG'>Genesis</ent> 11:1-9. 25</p>

<p>  "The message; human curiosity and technological derring-do makes  God
  nervous;  God demolishes project, confounds language".  Gordan  further
  outlines the the scenario as follows:</p>

      science &amp; engineering circles
      Perpetuation of mediocre
      technology for energy
      generation, storage,distribu-
      tion, to maintain favorable

<p>  "When  everything is perfect, the right time shows up." 26 This  is
  equivalent  to  saying, "<ent type='ORG'>Absolute</ent> knowledge in the hands of  one  whose
  heart is not yet tender, would be a terrible weapon. 27 We might postulate that technological developments do not occur until
  the  planet  is ready.  The recent examination of the  theory  of  Gaia
  credits  the <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent> with an intelligence.  "Thousands of years  ago,  by
  means  of seeing, sorcerers became aware that the <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent>  was  sentinent
  and  that its awareness could affect the awareness of humans." 28  By
  implication  of  reciprocity the reverse could be true.  The  group  or
  collective  unconscious is still struggling with the result of  quantum
  and  relativity  theory.  We as a race were ready  for  nuclear  power,
  every  thing  was perfect and the right time showed up.  Soon  we  will
  have  put  the  technology  to good use or abandon  it  to  insure  our
  survival as a species.</p>

<p>    SO WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT</p>

<p>   FREE ENERGY: CREATING AN IDEA WHOSE <ent type='ORG'>TIME</ent> HAS COME</p>

<p>  Wireless transmission of power and free energy have not happened yet,
  perhaps  we aren't ready, perhaps the <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent> isn't ready.  <ent type='ORG'>Pogo</ent> said  it
  best,  " we have met the enemy and it is us."  In the <ent type='NORP'>Jungian</ent>  view  of
  collective  unconscious, things happen when the time is right,  we  get
  what  we agree to.  We need a flight plan.  And that plan must  realize
  that,</p>

<p>    WHEN THE POWER OF LOVE</p>

<p>   OVERCOMES</p>

<p>   THE LOVE OF POWER</p>

<p>     THERE WILL BE</p>

<p>     PEACE</p>

  engineer  and  has  16 years experience in  the  field  of  geophysics,
  aerospace  and industrial research and design.  While working  for  the
  Geophysical Services  Division  of  Texas  Instruments  and  at the
  University  of Texas at <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Grotz</ent> was introduced to and  worked
  with  the geophysical concepts which are of importance to the  wireless
  transmission  of power.  As a Senior Engineer at Martin  Marietta,  Mr.
  <ent type='ORG'>Grotz</ent>  designed and supervised the construction of  industrial  process
  control systems and designed and built devices and equipment for use in
  research  and development and for testing space flight  hardware. Mr.
  <ent type='ORG'>Grotz</ent>  also  worked  for the public utility  industry  installing  mini
  computer  based pollutant measuring data acquisition systems in  fossil
  fuel  power plants and as a results engineer in a nuclear power  plant.
  Mr. <ent type='ORG'>Grotz</ent> organized and chaired the 1984 <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> Centennial Symposium and
  the  1986  International  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>  Symposium and  was  president  of  the
  International  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent> Society, a not for profit corporation formed as  a
  result the first symposium.  As <ent type='ORG'>Project</ent> Manager for <ent type='ORG'>Project</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>,  Mr.
  <ent type='ORG'>Grotz</ent>  aided  in  the design and construction of a  recreation  of  the
  equipment  Nikola  <ent type='ORG'>Tesla</ent>  used  for  wireless  transmission  of power
  experiments  in  1899  in <ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent> Springs. Mr.  <ent type='ORG'>Grotz</ent>  received  his
  B.S.E.E. from <ent type='ORG'>the University of Connecticut</ent> in 1973.
