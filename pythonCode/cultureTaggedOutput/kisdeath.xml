<p>  In inve<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>igating events surrounding the massacre at <ent type='GPE'>Waco</ent>, I have
made some rather <ent type='GPE'>st</ent>artling discoveries.  For in<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>ance, I discovered that
three of the four <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> agents killed during the initial seige at <ent type='GPE'>Waco</ent> had
been Bill Clinton's bodyguards during his presidential campaign.  Film
footage from the initial seige (which can be seen in the video tape,
"<ent type='GPE'>Waco</ent>, the Big Lie"), shows an <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> agent throwing a grenade and shooting
a machine gun into the room where three other <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> agents have ju<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>
entered a window. In other words, this footage appears to show that these
agents were assasinated.  In the March 3, 1993, <ent type='ORG'>Dallas Morning News</ent>, all
three of the agents who went into the window on the roof of the Branch
Davidian house at Mt. Carmel were reported by the <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> to have been
killed inside.  This certainly seemed curious, as did the connections to
<ent type='GPE'>Waco</ent> of numerous highly placed government officials.  <ent type='ORG'>Curiouser</ent> and
curiouser.
  A former <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agent and a former <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> agent both told me to begin
 checking into the body count around Hillary and Bill Clinton, during
 Clinton's rise to governor of <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent> and since he has become
 President.  With ju<ent type='GPE'>st</ent> a little preliminary research of the period ju<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>
 prior to the election through the present, I found 21 people who
 Clinton knew personally, many of whom he knew intimately, and several
 who had been his escorts or bodyguards, all of whom had died under
 my<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>erious circum<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>ances or been ki "accidental" airplane or helicopter
 crashes:
   CLINTON BODY COUNT</p>

<p>(Not including 96 <ent type='NORP'>Branch Davidian</ent>s murdered in <ent type='GPE'>Waco</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, Feb. 28,

<p>PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM:</p>

<p>+ 2   July 30, 1992, C. Victor Raiser II, 52, the national
finance co-chairman of the Clinton for President campaign, and his son,
R. Montgomery Raiser, 22, were among five (5) people killed July 30 in a
crash of a private plane near <ent type='GPE'>Dillingham</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Alaska</ent>. Vincent Raiser was a
pa<ent type='GPE'>st</ent> national finance chairman of <ent type='ORG'>the Democratic National Committee</ent>, and
he served on the boards of <ent type='ORG'>the Democratic Business Council</ent> and the
Center for National Policy and the board of advisers of the Democratic

worked in <ent type='GPE'>Buffalo</ent> before moving to <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> in 1979.  He was a
speciali<ent type='GPE'>st</ent> in communications and corporate law and consultant to the law
firm of Jones Day Reavis &amp; Pogue until 1991.  He was chairman of the
<ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Mobile Satellite Corp., a telecommunications development

<p>+ 1   July 21, 1993 (<ent type='GPE'>UPI</ent>): Vincent Fo<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>er, A top legal aide to
President Clinton was announced to have "committed suicide in a park
outside <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>," by <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent></ent>.
  In a <ent type='GPE'>st</ent>atement, <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> press secretary Dee Dee Myers said
Vince Fo<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>er Jr., 48, <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent></ent> deputy counsel, was found dead in
a suburban <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> park, apparently killed by a self-inflicted gunshot
wound. Fo<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>er, originally from Hope, Ark., like Clinton, had come to
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> from the law firm of Hillary Rodham Clinton.
  No note was found near the body, which was discovered by local
authorities in Fort Marcy Park, near <ent type='GPE'>Fairfax</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Va</ent>., officials said, nor
was any possible reason Fo<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>er might have taken his life put forward.
  Fo<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>er mo<ent type='GPE'>st</ent> recently was involved in the admini<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>ration's
so-called <ent type='ORG'>Travelgate</ent> scandal, involving the abrupt firing of seven
longtime employees from <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent></ent> travel office and the hiring of
a di<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>ant cousin of Clinton's.
  An internal inve<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>igation by <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> chief of <ent type='GPE'>st</ent>aff Thomas
McLarty documented Fo<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>er's involvement in the process, which included
contacts with the fir<ent type='GPE'>st</ent> lady on the subject of possible criminal
wrongdoing. But Fo<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>er was not among the four <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> <ent type='GPE'>st</ent>affers
reprimanded for their roles in the dismissals.
  Fo<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>er was among those responsible for initiating a private
audit, then an <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> inve<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>igation of the matter. [Also reported in "Park
Police To Conduct Inquiry 'Routine' Probe Set On Fo<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>er's Death," The

<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> Po<ent type='GPE'>st</ent> Staff Writer, Section: A SECTION, p. a08.]
  Fo<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>er was purportedly speaking with an Editor at a <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>
newspaper prior to his death.  He was found shot in the back of the head
with a 1913 Colt .38 revolver which he did not own.  The revolver had no
serial number, even though all Colt revolvers since the late 1800's have
had serial numbers except a special series issued to the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.  Fo<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>er
advised the Clinton's on their finances.  There are presently at lea<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>
two bank scandals that are emerging from Little Rock <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent>, involving
banks in which the Clintons have an intere<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>.  Additionally, it is now
well e<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>ablished that gun and drug running out of <ent type='ORG'>Mena</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent>, via
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>Evergreen Aviation</ent> and Pat Foley's <ent type='ORG'>Summit Aviataion</ent> has fuelled
political coffers for sometime, as the beneficiaries turned a blind eye.
Perhaps Fo<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>er was privy to this information, among others.</p>

<p>+ 1   June 22, 1993, the partially decomposed body of Paul Wilcher, a
49-year-old inve<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>igative lawyer, was found on a toilet in his Capitol
Hill apartment in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C.  At the time of his death, he was
inve<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>igating the "October Surprise" conspiracy during the 1980 federal
election campaign.  He had been interviewing an inmate who claimed to
have piloted George Bush to <ent type='GPE'>Paris</ent> so he could secretly seek to delay the
release of 52 <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> ho<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>ages in <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>. [Reported in the "<ent type='ORG'>Autopsies</ent>
delayed as body count rises," The <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> Times, Thursday, July 15,
1993, By: Brian Reilly - Edition: Final Section: A Page: A1.] Not
mentioned in this article are other facts.  Prior to his death, Wilcher
had recently spoken with John Parsons, a producer of syndicated
television programs, about making a documentary of his findings.  He had
also spoken with John <ent type='GPE'>Va</ent>ssillos, the attorney for <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> operative Mike
Riconosciuto. Riconosciuto claims he was involved in a web of
underworld, <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, and <ent type='ORG'>Department of Ju<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>ice</ent> dealings, revealed in
allegations brought by a computer company called <ent type='ORG'>Inslaw Inc</ent>. that the
Ju<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>ice Department had <ent type='GPE'>st</ent> s software product, "Promis," then driven the
firm into bankruptcy and that the program had been sold to countries all
over the world by persons affiliated with then attorney-general Ed
Meese. Riconosciuto says that the program was provided to Wackenhut
Corp. of <ent type='ORG'>Coral Gables</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>FL</ent>, and that Wackenhut hired 50 of the world's
top programmers to modify the code of the software at the <ent type='NORP'>Southern</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>California</ent> Cabazon <ent type='NORP'>Indian</ent> reservation. Riconosciuto also has detailed
his involvement in gun running and drug dealing conducted out of <ent type='ORG'>Mena</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent>. Danny Casalero, 44, a reporter who was inve<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>igating the
Inslaw scandall and had spoken with Riconosciuto, was found murdered in
a hotel bathtub in Washing C. in 1991, the day after telling friends and
family that was about to receive material that would provide him with
documentation linking Inslaw to October Surprise and the <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>-Contra
scandals. Paul Wilcher was also inve<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>igating these same links, as well
as their connection to the deaths of the <ent type='ORG'>ATF</ent> agents and <ent type='NORP'>Branch Davidian</ent>s
at Mt. Carmel at the time of his own death.</p>

<p>THE USS DEATHSHIP (a/k/a USS ROOSEVELT):</p>

prominantly in a "<ent type='ORG'>Nato</ent> Peacekeeping Plan" for <ent type='GPE'>Serbia</ent>/<ent type='GPE'>Bosnia</ent>.  Both also
figure prominantly in three separate crashes, killing more than a dozen
people associated with Clinton [Reported in "All Plans Include Key <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent>

Carrier Roosevelt:</p>

<p>+ 4   February 23, 1993: Maj.  Gen.  Jarrett J.  Robertson, 52, the
deputy commanding general of V Corps, died when an Army UH-60 <ent type='ORG'>Blackhawk</ent>
helicopter crashed as it attempted to land at <ent type='GPE'>Wiesbaden</ent> air base
February 23, 1993.  V Corps is an armored force headquartered in nearby

currently has troops in <ent type='GPE'>Somalia</ent> and a medical unit in <ent type='GPE'>Croatia</ent>.  Also
killed were Col. William J. Densberger, 47, the corps' chief of
operations and plans; Col. Robert J. Kelly, 48, its chief of

<p>  These five men had been escorts for President Clinton when he
visited the Carrier Roosevelt.</p>

<p>+ 4   May 19, 1993: On May 21, 1993, <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Marine</ent> Corps</ent> grounded its
entire presidential fleet of nine <ent type='ORG'>VH</ent>-60N helicopters pending the outcome
of the inve<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>igation of a crash involving one of the presidential fleet
helicopters, a <ent type='ORG'>VH</ent>-60N <ent type='ORG'>Blackhawk</ent> helicopter that went down in a heavily
wooded area near <ent type='LOC'>the Potomac River</ent> about 35 miles southwe<ent type='GPE'>st</ent> of
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> on May 19, 1993.  Killed in the crash were Maj. William S.
Barkley, Jr., Staff Sgt. Brian D. <ent type='ORG'>Haney</ent>, and Sgt. Timothy D. <ent type='ORG'>Sabel</ent>, and
Capt. Scott J. Reynolds.</p>

<p> Maj. Barkley, 27, of <ent type='GPE'>Hickory</ent>, N.C. became a naval aviator in 1977
and was assigned to the presidential squadron in January 1990.  He was
one of only eight pilots in the squadron authorized to fly the
president, according to Betty Jo Bragg, longtime secretary to Barkley's
father.
  Sgt. Timothy D. <ent type='ORG'>Sabel</ent>, 27, of Ripon, Wis., was "responsible for
the maintenance of the airplane.  He goes on all flights," said Ma<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>er
Sgt. Paul Earle, a <ent type='ORG'>Marine</ent> spokesman at Quantico, <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> (which is also
<ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> headquarters).
  Staff Sgt. Brian D. <ent type='ORG'>Haney</ent>, 32, of <ent type='GPE'>North Ridgeville</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Ohio</ent>, was the
quality assurance representative on the helicopter. Carolyn <ent type='ORG'>Haney</ent>, his
mother, said her son had flown with President George Bush to <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> and
in the presidential campaign "all over <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>."
  Capt. Scott J. Reynolds, 33, of <ent type='GPE'>Wausau</ent>, Wis., joined the <ent type='ORG'>Marine</ent>s
in 1984, was designated a naval aviator in 1987 and was a veteran of the
Persian Gulf War
  Clinton had flown once on that particular craft, according to
<ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers. That flight took the president to
the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt off the <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> coa<ent type='GPE'>st</ent> in
March, she said.  [Reported in "<ent type='ORG'>Marine</ent>s identify crash victims,"

  Notice, above, that the President's escorts during Clinton's one
visit to the Carrier Roosevelt on March 12, 1993, were all later killed
in a plane crash, too.</p>

<p>More Bodyguards:</p>

<p>+ 4   February 28, 1993.  In the initial assault on Mt. Carmel in
<ent type='GPE'>Waco</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, four agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
were killed.  Those killed in the attack were : Steve Willis, 32, of
Hou<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>on; Robert J. Williams, 26, Little Rock, Ark.; Conway LeBleu, 30,
<ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent>; and Todd McKeehan, 28, <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent>. [Reported in "UPDATE:
AT LEAST FIVE DEAD, 15 INJURED IN TWO SHOOTOUTS AT TEXAS CULT COMPOUND
WACO, TEXAS," MARCH 1, 1993, <ent type='GPE'>UPI</ent>.]
  President Clinton himself revealed that these men had been his
bodyguards in a speech on March 18, 1993, before employees of the
Treasury Department:
  "My prayers and I'm sure yours are <ent type='GPE'>st</ent>ill with the families of
all four of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents who were killed in
<ent type='GPE'>Waco</ent> -- Todd McKeehan and <ent type='ORG'>Conway Le Bleu</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New Orleans</ent>; Steve Willis of
Hou<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>on, and Robert Williams from my hometown of Little Rock.  Three of
those four were assigned to my security during the course of the primary
or general election." ["REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT TO EMPLOYEES OF THE
TREASURY DEPARTMENT," The Cash Room, Treasury Department, March 18,
1993, 11:48 A.M. EST.]</p>

<p>21 - Total confirmed deaths of persons connected to Clinton in the pa<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>
year. (I have not included people who were also killed in the crashes
with whom there is no confirmed link at this time, such as the three
persons who were killed in the same crash as Vincent Raiser and his
son).  All of these people died of unnatural causes.  Four were shot, 17
were killed in crashes of helicopters or airplanes.
  The <ent type='GPE'>st</ent>ati<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>ical probabilities of Clinton knowing 21 people, all
of whom died either in accidents or under my<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>erious circum<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>ances in
less than a year's time, is virtually zero.</p>

<p>  And Where Do These Guys Fit In:</p>

<p>+ 3 July 21, 1993, (<ent type='GPE'>AP</ent>): Three <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> National <ent type='ORG'>Guard</ent>smen, reportedly
mi<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>aken for pop-up targets, were shot to death by fellow soldiers
Wednesday during a night vision training exercise.
 "They were hit by fire from other soldiers," said Lt. Col. Ed
Komandosky, a spokesman at <ent type='ORG'>Guard</ent> headquarters in Au<ent type='GPE'>st</ent>in.  Komandosky
said the victims were members of the 3rd Battalion, 141<ent type='GPE'>st</ent> Infantry of
the <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> National <ent type='ORG'>Guard</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>McAllen</ent>, had experience in the training
exercise and "had been in the <ent type='ORG'>Guard</ent> for some time."
  Killed were Spc. Daniel F. Benitez, 27, of Donna; Spc. Jose C.
Ramos Jr., 42, of Weslaco; and Sgt. Raul Cardenas, 27, of Weslaco were
pronounced dead at <ent type='ORG'>Darnall Army Community Hospital</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Killeen</ent>.
  Did these people have any connection to the flame-throwing tank
that was used to set the fire at Mt. Carmel, in <ent type='GPE'>Waco</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent> on April 19,
1993?  All of them were <ent type='NORP'>Latinos</ent>.  Were they killed in <ent type='LOC'>South America</ent> and
an accident arranged to explain their deaths?</p>

<p>+ 1   Could John A. <ent type='ORG'>Wilson</ent> have known too much about insider politics?
John A. <ent type='ORG'>Wilson</ent>, for 16 years a <ent type='ORG'>City Councilman</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C., was
found dead from a supposed suicide. His wife had already left for work
and he was found in his underwear, hanging in his basement, later in the
morning, as if he had awakened, gone to the basement and hung himself.
No suicide note was found.</p>

<p>  What is emerging from the research I have conducted is a clear
picture that those who know too much or those who interfere with the one
world government plan, die.  Did any of these people know too much? And
what is it that they know or saw? As the information develops, I will
provide updates.  Stay tuned.</p>
