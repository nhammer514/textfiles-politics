<p>This text is being posted with the intent to EDUCATE those of you who
know not the silent and pervasive influence of your hidden masters. Some
have looked for shadows of the old illuminati; they look amiss, not seeing
that which is all around them. If you know not the "who" and the "why",
efforts will be mis-directed. This is NOT a "conspiracy"..nay, it is a
very cold and calculated <ent type='ORG'>NETWORK</ent> of individuals whose intent is nothing
short of implementation of a "New <ent type='ORG'>World Order</ent>"; an oligarchic rein in which
*you* serve as little more that slaves in their "technocracy". This network
has every intention to implement a cashless society, for it is they who
control every aspect of finance and banking over the entire globe. They
have had about 100 years to perfect their plans and put them into practice.
 
Please understand that the <ent type='NORP'>Bilderbergers</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>the Council</ent> on Foreign Relations,
the Tri-lateral Commission,<ent type='ORG'>the Institute for Policy Studies</ent>, the Roundtables,
the "Club of Rome",etc are ALL bound by common denominators of long-standing
families ties, and interests and come together as a _single_ policy making
body that is known today as "<ent type='ORG'>The Committee</ent> of 300" . This has also been
known as "The <ent type='NORP'>Olympians</ent>", the "<ent type='ORG'>Policy Committee</ent>".
 
Don't be mis-led by labels such as "<ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>" or "Rothschild"; for these
are simply the families who have the mechanisms of control already set in
place,but of themselves are not the entire network; that being the
"Committee of 300". It is THEY who control the UN, who tell the heads of
nations "when to jump and how high", they who are behind the world's illicit
drug trade via the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and the old <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> <ent type='LOC'>East India</ent> links. They who
manage the <ent type='ORG'>IMF</ent>,set policy at <ent type='ORG'>GATT</ent> conferences. It is they who ARE the
"<ent type='ORG'>Shadow Government</ent>". It is they who manage the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>,<ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>,<ent type='ORG'>DIA</ent>..the same
group that took out JFK and have MURDERED around 173 people in their efforts
to suppress the truth about all the links..they who were behind the
assassination of <ent type='ORG'>RFK</ent>,MLK..they who are behind the suppression of truth
regarding the <ent type='ORG'>MIA</ent>'s; It is the same group behind E. Howard Hunt,
John Singlaub, Ollie North..the very same group who brought down Richard
Nixon in Watergate..the same group behind the persecution of the <ent type='NORP'>Christic</ent>
Institute..the same people who were behind Nugan-Hand..the same group
that groomed Jimmy Carter for the Presidency..the same group who ARE
the "Military-Industrial complex", the same group behind the total
militarization of <ent type='ORG'>NASA</ent>..the same group who ARE "MJ-12", were behind the
"<ent type='ORG'>Jason Group</ent>"..the same behind <ent type='ORG'>Project Blue Book</ent>, The Condon Committee,
the same who started up the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>..who are responsible for the MURDER of
Danny Casalaro..the same group responsible for the world-wide DISINFO
campaign regarding the <ent type='ORG'>TRUTH</ent> of UFO sightings and contacts. The very
SAME group who OWN THE ME<ent type='ORG'>DIA</ent>..ie..<ent type='ORG'>The Washington Post</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>NBC</ent> (General
Electric),ABC,CBS,<ent type='ORG'>The New York Times</ent>,etc. The same group behind the
the Warren Commission,ad nauseum..
 
I DO believe I could make a DIRECT connection here with just what 
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>BASE says on WACKENHUT that also ties in the <ent type='ORG'>Shadow Government</ent>
with UFO related installations; this is but *ONE* connection..there
are many,many more that can be and will be ferreted out for exposure.</p>

   To : John Galt
Subject : Wackenhut
John Galt said:</p>

<p> &gt; <ent type='ORG'>Wackenhut Corp</ent>., one of the nation's largest security firms, said Friday
 &gt; it has bought the U.S. security operations of <ent type='ORG'>ISS International</ent> Service
 &gt; System Inc.  The purchase price was not disclosed.  <ent type='ORG'>ISS International</ent>
 &gt; has more than 700 employees in its U.S. security operations, primarily
 &gt; in <ent type='GPE'>Jacksonville</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Atlanta</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Cleveland</ent> and
 &gt; <ent type='GPE'>Chattanooga</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Tenn</ent>.</p>

<p>In several investigations that I am currently involved in for <ent type='ORG'>UFO Magazine</ent> as
well as my radio show "UFOs Tonite", I have come across the Wackenhut
connection. As many of you may know, Wackenhut is responsible for outside
security around <ent type='LOC'>Area</ent> 51 and site S-4. Last year there was a helicopter crash
in <ent type='GPE'>Las Vegas</ent> that killed a number of Wackenhut employees, plus they are
involved in the Inslaw scandel. At any rate much more than I can go into here.

<p>This information was reported in the June 24, 1991 issue of "THE SPOTLIGHT".</p>

<p>This is not the entire article, only the highlights.  If you would like to
read this article in its entirety please refer to the above publication.</p>

<div>    ----------------------------</div>

<p>The word out of the Bilderberg annual meeting is that there will be another
war within the next five years.</p>

<p>It was repeatedly stated at the Bilderberg meeting that there will be 
"other Saddams" in the years ahead who must be dealt with swiftly and 
efficiently.</p>

<p>The Bilderberg group plans a global army at the disposal of the United 
Nations.  It is their hope that the U.N. will become the world government
by the year 2000.</p>

<p>"A U.N. army must be able to act immediately, anywhere in the world, without
delays involved in each country making its own decision whether to
participate, based on parochial considerations," said Henry Kissinger.</p>

<p>If <ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent> can be persuaded to surrender warmaking decisions to the U.N.,
"parochial nationalism" in <ent type='NORP'>Briton</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> and elsewhere will disappear,
Bilderberg speakers said.</p>

<p>"The <ent type='LOC'>Persian Gulf</ent> venture has advanced the cause by years" one speaker said.</p>

<div>    ----------------------------</div>

<p>So there you have it, the "One Worlders" are still alive and well.</p>

<p>The following is on the historical perspective of just the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>
and Rothschild connections and in no way attempts to cover every
aspect, but will suffice to give you a basis on which to understand
how pervasive the Web of influence is and that it is a good deal MORE
than "merely a conspiracy". Just <ent type='ORG'>WHO</ent> makes up the ILLEGAL SHADOW
GOVERMNENT,YOUR HIDDEN MASTERS?</p>

<p>I ask no one to accept any of this at face value, and would heartily
encourage you to perform your own investigation. To that end,I've
provided an extensive list of reading materials at the end of this
text. 
 
And lastly, I would include a very lucid assessment of our situation
by John DiNardo, which in my opinion, is absolutely correct. There have
been MANY people who are posting such as John, Dave Radcliffe, Rich
Winkel and others who have been showing you just *<ent type='ORG'>WHO</ent>* the CANCER IS.</p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If the usurpers of our freedom, the plunderers of our life's earnings,
  the despoilers of our planet <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent>, the deluders of our TV-zombified
  society, the desecrators of our Constitution can crush the <ent type='NORP'>Christic</ent> 
  Institute -- than what refuge is left for the few remaining 
  <ent type='NORP'>Christic</ent>-like organizations to shelter THEM from this Frankenstein
  Monster government?  What refuge is left for you and me, and for our
  children who will necessarily find themselves forced to riot and
  spill their blood in the streets during the twenty-first century? 
  It always degenerates to that, you know.</p>

<p>  We <ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent> are a lazy, short-sighted bunch. We realize that if we
  don't earn a living, we will be impoverished. We realize that if we
  don't brush our teeth, our teeth will rot out of our mouths. We 
  realize that if we don't service our cars, they will fail to operate.
  Yet, we don't realize -- or we're too lazy to admit -- that if we
  don't supervise and participate in our system of government to ensure
  that our Constitution is protected from the greedy, power-mad 
  neurotics whose ambitions drive them to seize the reins of power 
  and wealth vested in our <ent type='ORG'>Federal Government</ent>, then our libertarian 
  foundations will crumble beneath us, leaving us to fall into the
  pit of subjugation that the corporate rulers have prepared for us.</p>

<p>  As we witness our free-fall into the pit, we finally understand
  that the law is slipping out of our hands; that we and our children
  will have to resort to meeting in dark rooms and plotting to recover
  our Constitutional freedoms which the usurpers have seized through
  television, that great national <ent type='NORP'>Svengali</ent> -- that opiate of the masses 
  which they have so cleverly employed to sedate, delude and distract us
  while quietly cuffing our ankles and wrists. How could we be so stupid
  as to surrender our minds to Big Brother, never suspecting that 
  whenever someone offers you free entertainment, day after day and
  year after year, it's got to be costing you.  </p>

<p>  Why shouldn't we be as vulnerable to totalitarianism as are
  the peoples of most other societies around the world. More so, 
  considering the fact that totalitarianism originates from within the 
  military elite. And whose nation has the most savagely powerful  
  military force on the planet?  What's worse is that it's not just the
  military that's militating against our Constitutional freedoms.
  It's the military-industrial complex. President Eisenhower left office
  a third of a century ago by warning us that the military-industrial
  complex is the greatest threat to our freedom. That was as much of
  a warning as he dared give, lest he meet the doom of his valiant 
  successor who tried to actually BE the President of <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>.</p>

<p>  How knowledgeable was <ent type='ORG'>the General</ent> of the <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> of the Second World War,
  Dwight Eisenhower, in his fear of the military-industrial complex?
  As knowledgeable as President Kennedy is dead!</p>

<p>  So you see, there really isn't much time left. If we prove to be too
  lazy now to unite behind Constitutional upholders such as the
  <ent type='NORP'>Christic</ent> Institute -- then our children in the twenty-first century
  will NOT be too frightened to stand up against the bullets of the
  Wackenhut Security Corporation of Coral Gables, <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>. Because
  when the oppression becomes intolerable, you, I and anyone would 
  stand up to bullets, rather than go on living in unbearable agony.
  Ask the <ent type='NORP'>Palestinian</ent> people who stand up to bullets every day --
  or the <ent type='NORP'>Rumanian</ent> people, or the <ent type='NORP'>Guatemalan</ent> people, or the <ent type='NORP'>Filipino</ent> 
  people, or the <ent type='NORP'>Chinese</ent> people, or the <ent type='NORP'>Iranian</ent> people, or the
  <ent type='NORP'>Tibetan</ent> people, or the <ent type='NORP'>Timorese</ent> people.</p>

<p>  If we prove to be too lazy now, OUR generation may even see the day
  when citizens will speak softly and listen intently for the footsteps
  of the <ent type='ORG'>Gestapo</ent> who may finally come to kick down our front door and
  arrest us for plotting to regain the Constitutional freedoms 
  that were once our heritage.</p>

<p>  Excerpted from the book, "Rape of The Constitution; Death of Freedom" by 
  Gyeorgos C. Hatonn . </p>

<p>  *** The <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent> ***</p>

<div>  ========================================================================</div>

<p>  Many <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> conservatives believe as a matter of faith that the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s and <ent type='ORG'>the Council</ent> on Foreign Relations exercise absolute 
  control over the government and the people of the U.S.  This thesis can 
  be accepted as a working formula if one remains conscious of the larger 
  issues.  Two writers for whom the present writer (E.M) has great respect, 
  Dr. Emanuel Josephson and Morris Bealle, insisted on focusing on the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s and excluding all other aspects of the <ent type='ORG'>World Order</ent>. This 
  severely limited the effect of their otherwise groundbreaking work on the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Medical Monopoly</ent>. This writer advanced a contrary view in "<ent type='ORG'>The World</ent> 
  Order," fixing upon the Rothschild monetary power, which reached a point 
  of world control by 1885, and its <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> policy group, the Royal 
  Institute of International Affairs, as the policy makers for what has 
  essentially been, since 1900, a re-established colonial government, 
  functions primarily through <ent type='ORG'>the Council</ent> on Foreign Relations, but only as 
  the subsidiary of <ent type='ORG'>RIIA</ent> and through the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation, which 
  controls government functions, the educational establishments, the media, 
  the religions and the state legislatures.  </p>

<p>  It is true that the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> colonials have "free elections," in which 
  they have the absolute right to vote for one of two opposing candidates, 
  both of whom have been handpicked and financed by the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> 
  syndicate.  This touching evidence of "democracy" serves to convince most 
  <ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent> that you are indeed a free people.  You even have a cracked 
  <ent type='ORG'>Liberty Bell</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Philadelphia</ent> to prove it.  <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> youths have been free 
  since 1900 to be marched off to die in <ent type='NORP'>Hegelian</ent> wars in which both 
  combatants received their instructions from the <ent type='ORG'>World Order</ent>. You are free 
  to invest in a stock market in which the daily quantity,price and value 
  of the monetary unit is manipulated and controlled by a Federal Reserve 
  System which is answerable only to <ent type='ORG'>the Bank</ent> of England. It has maintained 
  its vaunted "independence" from your government control, but this is the 
  only independence it has ever had.  </p>

<p>  The realization that you do indeed live under the dictates of the 
  "<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent>" can well be the starting point of the long road 
  back of a genuine struggle for <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> independence.  In exposing "the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s" as agents of a foreign power, which is not merely a foreign 
  power, but a genuine world government, you must realize that this is not 
  merely a group dedicated to making money, but a group which is committed 
  to maintaining the power of a colonial form of government over the 
  <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> people.  Thus the ancient calumny of John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> as a 
  man obsessed by greed (a category in which he has plenty of company) 
  obscures the fact that from the day the Rothschilds began to finance his 
  march towards a total oil monopoly in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> from their 
  coffers at <ent type='ORG'>the National City Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Cleveland</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> was never an 
  independent power, nor does any department of the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent> 
  operate as an independent power.  You know that the <ent type='ORG'>Cosa Nostra</ent>, or 
  <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>, with which the <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent> is closely allied, has somewhat 
  autonomous power in the regions which have been assigned to that 
  particular "family" by the national directors, but this always implies 
  that that family remains under total control and answerable for 
  everything which occurs in its territory.  </p>

<p>  Similarly, the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent> operates under clearly defined 
  spheres of influence.  The "charitable" organizations, the business 
  companies and the policy groups, always meld into a working operation, 
  nor can any department of the <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent> strike out on its own or 
  formulate an independent policy, no matter what may be its 
  justification.  </p>

<p>  The <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent> operates under the control of the world 
  financial structure, which means that on any given day, all of its assets 
  could be rendered close to worthless by adroit financial manipulation.  
  This is the final control, which ensures that no one can quit the 
  organization.  Not only would he be stripped of all assets, but he would 
  be under contract for immediate assassination.  <ent type='ORG'>The Department</ent> of Justice 
  is well aware that the only "terrorists" operating in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> 
  are the agents of the <ent type='ORG'>World Order</ent>, but they prudently avoid any mention 
  of this fact.  </p>

<p>  The world financial structure, far from being an unknown or hidden 
  organization, is actually well known and well defined.  It consists of 
  the major <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> Banks; the survivors of the old <ent type='NORP'>Venetian</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Genoese</ent> banking 
  axis; <ent type='ORG'>the Big Five</ent> of the world grain trade; the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> combine, 
  centered in <ent type='ORG'>the Bank</ent> of England and its chartered merchant banks, 
  functioning through the Rothschilds and the <ent type='ORG'>Oppenheimers</ent> and having 
  absolute control over their <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> colony through <ent type='ORG'>the Royal Bank</ent> of 
  Canada and <ent type='ORG'>the Bank</ent> of Montreal, their <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> lieutenants being the 
  Bronfmans, Belzbergs, Reichmanns and other financial operators; and the 
  colonial banking structure in the U.S., controlled by <ent type='ORG'>the Bank</ent> of England 
  through the <ent type='ORG'>Federal Reserve System</ent>; the <ent type='GPE'>Boston</ent> Brahmin families who made 
  their fortunes in the opium trade, including the Delanos and others and 
  the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Bank, <ent type='ORG'>Chase Manhattan Bank</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Express, the present 
  form of the old Rothschild representatives in the U.S., which includes 
  <ent type='ORG'>Kuhn</ent>,Loeb Company and <ent type='ORG'>Lehman Brothers</ent>.  </p>

<p>  It is notable that the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent> is far down on the list of 
  the worlds financial structure.  Why then is it of such importance?  
  Although it is not the crucial factor in financial decision in the 
  <ent type='LOC'>Western Hemisphere</ent>, it is the actual working control mechanism of the 
  <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> colony.  The <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> family themselves,like the 
  Morgans,Schiffs and Warburgs, have faded into insignificance, but the 
  mechanism created in their name roars along at full power,still 
  maintaining all of the functions for which it was organized.  Since he 
  set up the <ent type='ORG'>Trilateral Commission</ent>, David <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> has functioned as a 
  sort of international courier for the <ent type='ORG'>World Order</ent>, principally concerned 
  with delivering working instructions to the <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> bloc,either 
  directly, in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> or by traveling to the area.  Laurence <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> 
  is active in the operation of the <ent type='ORG'>Medical Monopoly</ent>, but his principal 
  interests are in operating various vacation spas in tropical areas.  They 
  are the two survivors of the "Fortunate Five," the five sons of John D. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, Jr. and Abby Aldrich. John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, Jr. died in an 
  institution in <ent type='GPE'>Tucson</ent>,<ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> and was hastily cremated.  John D. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> III died in a mysterious accident on a <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> Parkway near 
  his home.  Nelson <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, named after his grandfather, died in the 
  arms of a TV journalist.  It was later revealed that he had also been in 
  the arms of another TV journalist at the same time; the death was hushed 
  up for many hours.  It was generally believed that he ran afoul of his 
  <ent type='NORP'>Columbian</ent> drug connection, the disagreement hardly being trivial; it 
  involved several billion dollars in drug profits which had not been 
  properly apportioned.  Winthrop <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> died an alcoholic in the arms 
  of his black boy friend.  He had been interviewed on television by Harry 
  Reasoner to explain his hasty move from <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent>. Winthrop 
  learned that his black boy friend, an <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> sergeant who apparently taught 
  him the mysteries of drill,refused to live in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>. To celebrate this 
  alliance, Winthrop <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> gave magnificiently to <ent type='ORG'>Negro</ent> 
  causes,including the <ent type='ORG'>Urban League</ent> building on East 48th Street in New 
  York. A plaque on the second floor notes that it was his gift; it might 
  well have stated "From Hadrian to his Antinous."  </p>

<p>  We do not wish to imply that the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s no longer have influence, 
  but that the major policy dictates of the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent> are 
  handed down by other caps, of whom they continue to be a visible force.  
  Through the person of David <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, the family is sometimes called 
  "the first family of <ent type='GPE'>the Soviet Union</ent>." Only he and Dr. Armand Hammer, 
  the moving force behind USTEC, have permanent permission to land their 
  private planes at the <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent> Airport. Others would suffer the fate of <ent type='ORG'>KAL</ent> 
  007. David <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s most significant trip to <ent type='GPE'>the Soviet Union</ent> may 
  have been the fateful day when he landed in <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent>, having been told to 
  inform <ent type='NORP'>Khrushchev</ent> that he was "through". The <ent type='NORP'>Russians</ent> are very health 
  conscious, and a scientist had sent information to <ent type='NORP'>Khrushchev</ent> that the 
  use of chemical fertilizers in <ent type='GPE'>the Soviet Union</ent> presented a threat to the 
  people.  <ent type='NORP'>Khrushchev</ent> then announced a major change in the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> farm 
  policy, centering around a reduction in the use of chemicals.  This was 
  upsetting to the head of the world's <ent type='ORG'>Chemical Fertilizer</ent> trust, David 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, and he responded with a terse one word command, "Out".  </p>

<p>  Both the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> family fortune and the considerable portion set 
  aside in the foundations of the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent> are effectively 
  insulated against any type of government control.  <ent type='ORG'>FORTUNE</ent> magazine noted 
  August ,1986, that John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>,Jr.  had created trusts in 1934 
  which now amounted to some $2.3 billion; another 200 million had been set 
  aside for the Abby <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> branch.  The five sons had trusts which in 
  1986 amounted to $2.1 billion.  These trusts had originally amounted to 
  only $50 million each,showing the increase in their assets as well as 
  inflation during the ensuing half century.  <ent type='ORG'>FORTUNE</ent> estimated the 1986 
  total <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> wealth as $3.5 billion of which $900 million was in 
  securities and real estate.  They owned 45% of the Time Life 
  Building; Nelson <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>International Basic Economy Corporation</ent> had 
  been sold to a <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> company in 1980. For years, the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> family 
  had deliberately kept the rents low in its major holding, <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> 
  Center, a $1.6 billion investment yielding an annual return of 1% . This 
  was a convenient <ent type='ORG'>manuever</ent> for tax purposes, and a good one at that.  </p>

<p>  Much of the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> wealth might be attributed to old John D.'s 
  rapacity and ruthlessness; its origins are indubitably based in his 
  initial financing from <ent type='ORG'>the National City Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Cleveland</ent>, which was 
  identified in <ent type='ORG'>Congressional</ent> reports as one of the three Rothschild banks 
  in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> and by his later acceptance of the guidance of Jacob 
  Schiff of <ent type='ORG'>Kuhn</ent>,Loeb Company, who had been born in the Rothschild house in 
  <ent type='GPE'>Franfort</ent> and was now the principal Rothschild representive (but unknown 
  as such to the public) in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>.  </p>

<p>  With the seed money from <ent type='ORG'>the National City Bank</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Cleveland</ent>, old John D. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> soon laid claim to the title of the "most ruthless <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>". 
  It is more than likely that it was this quality which persuaded the 
  Rothschilds to back him.  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> realized early in the game that the 
  oil refinery business, which could offer great profits in a short time, 
  also was at the mercy of uncontrolled competition.  His solution was a 
  simple one--crush all competition.  The famous <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> dedication to 
  total monopoly was simply a business decision.  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> embarked on a 
  campaign of coercing all competing oil refineries out of business.  He 
  attacked on a number of fronts, which is also a lesson to all would be 
  entrepreneurs.  First, he would send a minion, not known to be working for 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, with an offer to buy the competing refinery for a low 
  price,but offering cash.  If the offer was refused, the competitor would 
  then come under attack from a competing refinery which greatly undercut 
  his price.  He might also suffer a sudden strike at his refinery,which 
  would force him to shut down.  Control of labor through unions has always 
  been a basic <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> technique.  Like <ent type='GPE'>the Soviet Union</ent>, they seldom 
  have labor trouble.  If these techniques failed, <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> would then 
  be saddened by a reluctant decision to use violence; beating the rival 
  workers as they went to and from their jobs, or burning or blowing up the 
  competing refinery.  </p>

<p>  These techniques convinced the Rothschilds that they had found their 
  man.They sent their personal representative,Jacob Schiff, to <ent type='GPE'>Cleveland</ent> to 
  help <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> plan further expansion.  At this time,the Rothschilds 
  controlled 95% of all railroad mileage in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>,through the 
  J.P. <ent type='ORG'>Morgan Company</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Kuhn Loeb Company</ent>,according to official 
  Department of Commerce figures for the year 1895. J.P. Morgan mentions in 
  his "Who's Who" listing that he controlled 50000 miles of U.S. 
  railways.  Schiff worked out an elaborate rebate deal for 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>,through a dummy corporation,<ent type='ORG'>South Improvement Company</ent>. These 
  rebates ensured that no other oil company could survive in competition 
  with the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> firm.  The scheme was later exposed,but by that time 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had achieved a virtual monopoly of the oil business in the 
  U.S. The daughter of one of his victims, Ida Tarbell,whose father was 
  ruined by <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s criminal operations, wrote the first major expose 
  of <ent type='ORG'>the Standard Oil Trust</ent>. She was promptly denounced as a "muckracker" 
  by the poseur, Theodore Roosevelt, who claimed to be a "trustbuster." In 
  fact, he ensured the dominance of <ent type='ORG'>the Standard Oil Trust</ent> and other giant 
  trusts.  </p>

<p>  During the next half century, John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> was routinely 
  caricatured by socialist propagandists as the epitome of the ruthless 
  capitalist.  At the same time, he was the principal financier of the 
  world <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> movement, through a firm called <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> International 
  Company. Despite the fact that <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> of Rothschild had already 
  achieved world control,the sound and the fury was directed exclusively 
  against its two principal representatives,John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> and J.P. 
  Morgan.  One of the few revelations of the actual state of affairs 
  appeared in <ent type='ORG'>TRUTH</ent> magazine,Dec 161912, which pointed out that "Mr. 
  Schiff is head of the great private banking house of <ent type='ORG'>Kuhn</ent>, Loeb Company 
  (I knew some of you bright readers would finally pick up that these names 
  are all attached to the greatest pharmaceutical firms in the world--even 
  into your very vitamin supplement business!), which represents the 
  Rothschild interests on your side of the <ent type='LOC'>Atlantic</ent>. He is described as a 
  financial strategist and has been for years the financial minister of the 
  great impersonal power known as <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent>."  Note that the name of 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> was not mentioned in the quote.  </p>

<p>  Because of these concealed factors,it was a relatively simple matter for 
  the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> public to accept the "fact" that the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s were the 
  preeminent power in your country.  This myth was actually clothed in the 
  apparel of power,the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Oil Trust becoming the 
  "military-industrial complex" which assumed political control of the 
  nation; the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Medical Monopoly</ent> attained control of the health 
  care of the nation, and the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation, a web of affiliated 
  tax emempt creations, effectively controlled the religious and 
  educational life of the nation.  The myth succeeded in its goal of 
  camouflaging the hidden rulers, the Rothschilds.  </p>

<p>  After Eustis Mullins and a few others, had been exposing this charade for 
  some twenty-five years a new myth began to be noised about in <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> 
  conservative circles, effectively propagated by active double agents.  
  This myth found a host of eager believers,because it heralded a growing 
  crack in the monolithic power which had been oppressing all the peoples 
  of the world.  This "new" revelation was that a struggle to the death for 
  world power had developed between the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s and the Rothschilds. 
  According to this startling development, one faction or the other, 
  depending on which agent you were listening to, had gained control of the 
  <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union and would use its power as the basis for achieving the 
  overthrow of the other faction.  The sudden death of several members of 
  the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> family was cited as "proof" that such a struggle was 
  taking place, although no Rothschild is known to have succumbed during 
  this "war." This ignored the general understanding that Nelson 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had been "eliminated" as the result of losing deposit slips 
  for several billion dollars of drugs from the <ent type='NORP'>Columbian</ent> cartel, or that 
  the other <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> deaths showed no trace of a "Rothschild 
  connection."  </p>

<p>  Having maintained extensive files on this situation for several decades, 
  the writer (E.M.),could not believe anyone could be so misinformed as to 
  think that "the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s" were now trying to seize power from the 
  Rothschilds, at a time when the influence of members of the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> 
  family was already in great decline, their family finances being handled 
  by John J. McCloy, and other faithful retainers;none of the retainers 
  would have been willing to engage in a genuine power struggle, as they 
  were faceless managers who lived only for their weekly paycheck.  They 
  had no ambitions of their own.  Nevertheless, many hopeful <ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent> 
  grasped at the will-o-the-wisp notion the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s were now "good 
  <ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent>" who were willing to risk all to overthrow the Rothschilds. 
  Amazingly enough, this pernicious story persisted for almost a decade 
  before being relegated to the curiosities of history.  </p>

<p>  Like J.P. Morgan, who had begun his commercial career by selling the U.S. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> some defective guns, the famous Hall carbine affair, John D. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> also was a war profiteer during the Civil War;he sold 
  unstamped Harkness liquor to Federal troops at a high profit, gaining the 
  initial capital to embark on his drive for monopoly.  His interest in the 
  oil business was a natural one; his father,William <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had been 
  "in oil" for years.  William <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had become an oil entrepreneur 
  after salt wells at <ent type='ORG'>Tarentum</ent>, near <ent type='GPE'>Pittsburgh</ent>, were discovered in 1842 to 
  be flowing with oil.  The owners of the wells,Samuel L. Kier, began to 
  bottle the oil and sell it for medicinal purposes.  One of his earliest 
  wholesalers was William <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>. The "medicine" was originally 
  labelled "Kier's Magic Oil". <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> printed his own labels, using 
  "<ent type='ORG'>Rock Oil</ent>" or "Seneca Oil", Seneca being the name of a well known <ent type='NORP'>Indian</ent> 
  Tribe. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> achieved his greatest notoriety and his greatest 
  profits by advertising himself as "William <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, the Celebrated 
  Cancer Specialist".  It is understandable that his grandsons would become 
  the controlling power behind the scenes of the world's most famous cancer 
  treatment center and would direct government funds and charitable 
  contributions to those areas which only benefit the <ent type='ORG'>Medical Monopoly</ent>. 
  William <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> spared no claim in his flamboyant career.  He 
  guaranteed "All Cases of Cancer Cured Unless They Are Too Far Gone". Such 
  were the healing powers that he attributed to his magic cancer cure that 
  he was able to retail it for $25 a bottle, a sum then equivalent to two 
  month's wages.  The "cure" consisted of a few well known diuretics, which 
  had been diluted by water.  This carnival medicine show barker could 
  hardly have envisioned that his descendants would control the greatest 
  and the most profitable <ent type='ORG'>Medical Monopoly</ent> in recorded history.  </p>

<p>  As an itinerant "carnie", a traveling carnival peddler, William 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had chosen a career which interfered with developing a stable 
  family life.  His son, John, rarely saw him, a circumstance which has 
  inspired some psychological analysts to conjecture that the absence of a 
  father figure or parental love may have contributed to John D. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s subsequent development as a money mad tyrant who plotted to 
  maim, poison and kill millions of his fellow <ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent> during almost a 
  century of his monopolistic operations and whose influence, reaching up 
  from the grave, remains the most dire and malignant presence in <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> 
  life.  This may have been a contributing factor--however, it is also 
  possible that he was totally evil.  It is hardly arguable that he is 
  probably one of the most Satanic figures in <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> history.  Evil being 
  defined as anything that moves the spiritual aspect of beingness away 
  from God as influenced through another.  </p>

<p>  It has long been a truism that you can find a horse thief or two in any 
  prominent <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> family.  In the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> family, it was more than 
  true in the case of William who seemed to have faithfully followed the 
  precepts of the Will of <ent type='GPE'>Canaan</ent> throughout his career, "love robbery, love 
  lechery".  He fled from a number of indictments for horse stealing and 
  you know how serious that is, finally disappearing altogether as William 
  and <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> and magically re-emerging as a Dr. William Levingston of 
  <ent type='GPE'>Philadelphia</ent>, a name which he retained for the rest of his life.  An 
  investigative reporter at Joseph Pulitzer's <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> World received a tip 
  that was followed up.  <ent type='ORG'>The World</ent> then disclosed that William Avery 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had died May 11, 1906 in <ent type='GPE'>Freeport</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Illinois</ent>, where he was 
  interred in an unmarked grave as Dr. William Levingston.  </p>

<p>  William <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s vocation as a medicine man greatly facilitated his 
  preferred profession of horse thief.  As one who planned to be in the 
  next county by morning, it was a simple matter to tie a handsome stallion 
  to the back of his wagon and head for the open road.  It also played a 
  large part in his vocation as a woman-chaser; he was described as being 
  "woman-mad".  </p>

<p>  On June 281849, he was indicted for raping a hired girl in Cayuga,New 
  York; he later was found to be residing in <ent type='GPE'>Oswego</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> and was 
  forced once again to decamp for parts unknown.  He had no difficulty in 
  financing his woman-chasing interests from the sale of his miraculous 
  cancer cure and from another product, his "Wonder Working Liniment", 
  which he offered at only two dollars a bottle.  It consisted of crude 
  petroleum from which the lighter oils had been boiled away, leaving a 
  heavy solution of paraffin,lube oil and tar, which comprised the 
  "liniment". William <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s original miracle oil survived until 
  quite recently as a concoction called <ent type='ORG'>Nujol</ent>, consisting principally of 
  petroleum and peddled as a laxative.  It was well known that <ent type='ORG'>Nujol</ent> was 
  merely an advertising sobriquet meaning "new oil", as opposed apparently, 
  to "old oil".  Sold as an antidote to constipation, it robbed the body of 
  fat-soluble vitamins, it being a well-established medical fact that 
  mineral oil coated the intestine and prevented the absorption of many 
  needed vitamins and other nutritional needs.  Its makers added carotine 
  as a sop to the health-conscious, but it was hardly worth the bother.  
  <ent type='ORG'>Nujol</ent> was manufactured by a subsidiary of <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent>, 
  called Stanco, whose only other product, manufactured on the same 
  premises, was the famous insecticide, Flit.  </p>

<p>  <ent type='ORG'>Nujol</ent> was hawked from <ent type='ORG'>the Senate Office Building</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> for years 
  during a more liberal interpretation of "conflict of interest".  In this 
  case, it was hardly a conflict of interest, because the august 
  peddler,Senator Royal S. Copeland, never had any interests other than 
  serving the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s.  He was a physician whom <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had 
  appointed as head of the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> State Department of Health and later 
  financed his campaign for the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent>.  Copeland's frank display of 
  commercialism amazed even the most blase' <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> reporters.  </p>

<p>  He devoted his <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> career to a daily program advertising <ent type='ORG'>Nujol</ent>. A 
  microphone was set up in his <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> office each morning, the first order 
  of business being the <ent type='ORG'>Nujol</ent> program, for which he was paid $75000 a 
  year, an enormous salary in the 1930's and more than the salary of the 
  President of <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>. Senator Copeland's exploits earned him a 
  number of nicknames on <ent type='ORG'>Capital Hill</ent>. He was often called the Senator from 
  the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Medical Association, because of his enthusiastic backing for 
  any program launched by the <ent type='ORG'>AMA</ent> and Morris Fishbein. More realistically, 
  he was usually referred to as "the Senator from <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent>". He could 
  be counted on to promote any legislation devised for the greater profit 
  of the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> monopoly.  During congressional debate on the Food and 
  Drug Act in 1938, he came under criticism from <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>woman Leonor 
  Sullivan, who charged that Senator Copeland, a physician who handled the 
  bill on the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> floor, frankly acknowledged during the debate that 
  soap was exempted from the law because the soap manufacturers, who were 
  the nation's largest advertisers, would otherwise join with other big 
  industries to fight the bill.  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>woman Sullivan complained that, 
  "Soap was officially declared in the law not to be a cosmetic.  The hair 
  dye manufacturers were given a license to market known dangerous 
  products, just so long as they placed a special warning on the label - 
  but what woman in a beauty parlor ever sees the label on the bulk 
  container in which hair dye is shipped?"  </p>

<p>  Just as the elder <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had spent his life in the pursuit of his 
  personal obsession, women, so his son John was equally obsessed, being 
  money-mad instead of woman-mad, totally committed to the pursuit of 
  ever-increasing wealth and power.  However, the principal accomplishments 
  of the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> drive for power, the rebate scheme for monopoly, the 
  chartering of the foundations to gain power over <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> citizens,the 
  creation of the central bank, the <ent type='ORG'>Federal Reserve System</ent>, the backing of 
  the World <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> Revolution and the creation of the Medical Monoply, 
  all came from the Rothschilds or from their <ent type='NORP'>European</ent> employees.  </p>

<p>  We cannot find in the records of John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> that he originated 
  any of these programs.  The concept of the tax exempt charitable 
  foundation originated with the Rothschild minion, George Peabody, in 
  1865. <ent type='ORG'>The Peabody Educational Foundation</ent> later became the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> 
  Foundation and many of you should recall that item.  Not that you might 
  have been around then but it continues to inadvertently be referred to as 
  such.  </p>

<p>  It is unlikely that even the diabolical mind of John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> could 
  have conceived of this devious twist.  A social historian has described 
  the major development of the late nineteenth century, when charitable 
  foundations and world Communism became important movements, as one of the 
  more interesting facets of history, perhaps equivalent to the discovery 
  of the wheel or fire.  This new discovery was the concept developed by 
  the rats, who after all have rather highly developed intelligences, that 
  they could trap people by baiting traps with little bits of cheese.  The 
  history of mankind since then has been the rats catching humans in their 
  traps.  Socialism -- indeed, any government program -- is simply the rat 
  baiting the trap with a smidgeon of cheese and catching himself a human.  </p>

<p>  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>man Wright Patman, chairman of <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Banking and Currency 
  Committee, noted from the floor of <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> that the establishment of the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation effectively insulated <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> from 
  competition.  The controlling stock had been removed from market 
  manipulation or possible buyouts by competitors.  It also relieved 
  <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> from most taxation, which then placed a tremendous added 
  burden on individual <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> taxpayers.  Although a <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> relative 
  by marriage, Senator Nelson Aldrich, <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> majority leader in the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent>, had pushed <ent type='ORG'>the General</ent> Education Board charter through <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, 
  the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation charter proved to be more difficult.  
  Widespread criticism of <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s monopolistic practices was heard, 
  and his effort to insulate his profits from taxation or takeover was seen 
  for what it was.  The charter was finally pushed through in 1913 (the 
  significant <ent type='ORG'>Masonic</ent> numeral 13 -- 1913 was also the year of the 
  progressive income tax and of the enactment of <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Reserve Act</ent>). 
  Senator Robert F. Wagner of <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>, another Senator from <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> 
  (there were quite a few), ramrodded the <ent type='ORG'>Congressional</ent> approval of the 
  charter.  The charter was then signed by John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, John D. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, Jr., Henry Pratt Judson, president of the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> 
  established University of Chicago,Simon Flexner, director of the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Institute, Starr Jameson, described in "Who's Who" as 
  "personal counsel to John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> in his benevolences", and 
  Charles W. Eliot, president of <ent type='ORG'>Harvard University</ent>.  </p>

<p>  The <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Oil Monopoly is now 127 years old, yet in 1911, the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent>, bowing to public outrage, had ruled that it had to be 
  broken up.  The resulting companies proved to be no problem for the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> interests.  The family retained a two per cent holding in 
  each of the "new" companies, while the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> foundations took a 
  three per cent holding in each company.  This gave them a five per cent 
  stock interest in each company; a one per cent holding in a corporation 
  is usually sufficient to maintain working control.  </p>

<p>  The involvement of the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s in promoting the World <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> 
  Revolution also developed from their business interests.  There was never 
  any commitment to the <ent type='NORP'>Marxist</ent> ideology; like anything else, it was there 
  to be used.  At the turn of the century, <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> was competing 
  fiercely with <ent type='ORG'>Royal Dutch Shell</ent> for control of the lucrative <ent type='NORP'>European</ent> 
  market.  <ent type='ORG'>Congressional</ent> testimony revealed that <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had sent large 
  sums of money to Lenin and Trotsky to instigate the <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> Revolution 
  in 1905. His banker, Jacob Schiff had previously financed the <ent type='NORP'>Japanese</ent> in 
  their war against <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> and had sent a personal emissary, George Kennan 
  to <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> to spend some twenty years in promoting revolutionary activity 
  against the Czar.  </p>

<p>  When the 1905 revolution failed, Lenin was placed "in storage" in 
  <ent type='GPE'>Switzerland</ent> until 1907. Trotsky was brought to the U.S., where he lived 
  rent free on the <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> property at <ent type='GPE'>Bayonne</ent>,<ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent>, its tank 
  field.  When the Czar abdicated, Trotsky was placed on a ship with three 
  hundred <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> revolutionaries from <ent type='LOC'>the Lower East Side</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> obtained a special passport for Trotsky from Woodrow Wilson 
  and sent Lincoln Steffens with him to make sure he was returned safely to 
  <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>. For traveling expenses, <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> placed a purse containing 
  $10000 in Trotsky's pocket.  </p>

<p>  On April 131917, when the ship stopped in <ent type='GPE'>Halifax</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> Secret 
  Service officers immediately arrested Trotsky and interred him in Nova 
  Scotia. The case became an international cause celebre, as leading 
  government officials from several nations frantically demanded Trotsky's 
  release.  <ent type='ORG'>The Secret Service</ent> had been tipped off that Trotsky was on his 
  way to take <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> out of the war, freeing more <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> armies to attack 
  <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> troups on the Western Front.  </p>

<p>  Prime Minister Lloyd George hurriedly cabled orders from <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> to the 
  <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> Secret Service to free Trotsky at once - they ignored him.  
  Trotsky was finally freed by the intervention of one of <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s 
  most faithful stooges, <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> Minister Mackenzie King, who had long 
  been a "labor specialist" for the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s. King personally obtained 
  Trotsky's release and sent him on his way as the emissary of the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s, commissioned to win the Bolshevik Revolution.  Thus, Dr. 
  Armand Hammer, who loudly proclaimed his influence in <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> as the 
  friend of Lenin, has an insignificant claim compared to the role of the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s in backing world Communism.  </p>

<p>  Although Communism, like other "isms", had origined with Marx's 
  association with <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> of Rothschild, it enlisted the reverent 
  support of John D.  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> because he saw Communism for what it is, 
  the ultimate monopoly, not only controlling the government, the monetary 
  system and all property, but also a monopoly which, like the corporations 
  it emulates, is self-perpetuating and eternal.  It was the logical 
  progression from his <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> monopoly.  </p>

<p>  An important step on the road to world monopoly was the most far-reaching 
  corporation invented by the Rothschilds. This was the international drug 
  and chemical cartel, I. G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>. Called "a state within a state" , it 
  was created in 1925 as Interessen Gemeinschaft Farbeinindustrie Aktien 
  Gesellschaft, usually known simply as I. G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>, which simply meant 
  "The <ent type='ORG'>Cartel</ent>". It had originated in 1904, when the six major chemical 
  companies in <ent type='GPE'>Germany</ent> began negotiations to form the ultimate cartel, 
  merging Badische Anilin,Bayer,Agfa,Hoechst,Weiler-ter-Meer, and 
  Greisheim-Electron.  The guiding spirit,as well as the financing, came 
  from the Rothschilds, who were represented by their <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> banker, Max 
  Warburg of M. M. Warburg Company, <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>. He later headed the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> 
  Secret Service during World War I and was personal financial advisor to 
  the Kaiser.  </p>

<p>  When the Kaiser was overthrown, after losing the war, Max Warburg was not 
  exiled with him to <ent type='GPE'>Holland</ent>; instead he became the financial advisor to 
  the new government.  </p>

<p>  Monarchs may come and go, but the real power remains with the bankers.  
  While representing <ent type='GPE'>Germany</ent> at the <ent type='GPE'>Paris</ent> Peace Conference, Max Warburg 
  spent pleasant hours renewing family ties with his brother, Paul Warburg, 
  who, after drafting <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Reserve Act</ent> at <ent type='GPE'>Jekyll Island</ent>, had headed 
  the U.S. banking system during the war.  He was in <ent type='GPE'>Paris</ent> as Woodrow 
  Wilson's financial advisor.  </p>

<p>  I. G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> soon had a net worth of six billion marks, controlling some 
  five hundred firms.  Its first president was Professor Carl Bosch. During 
  the period of <ent type='GPE'>the Weimar Republic</ent>, I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> officials,seeing the 
  handwriting, began a close association with one called Adolf Hitler, 
  supplying much needed funds and political influence.  </p>

<p>  The success of the I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> cartel had aroused the interest of other 
  industrialists.  Henry <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent> was favorably impressed and set up a <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> 
  branch of <ent type='ORG'>Ford Motor Company</ent>. Forty percent of the stock was purchased by 
  I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>. I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> then established an <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> subsidiary called 
  <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> I.G., in cooperation with <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent>. Its 
  directors included Walter Teagle, President of <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent>, Paul Warburg 
  of <ent type='ORG'>Kuhn</ent>,Loeb Company and <ent type='ORG'>Edsel</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent>, representing the <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent> interests.  
  John Foster Dulles, for the law firm, Sullivan and <ent type='ORG'>Cromwell</ent>, became the 
  attorney for I.G., frequently traveling between <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent> on 
  cartel business.  His law partner, Arthur Dean, is now director of the 
  $40 million <ent type='ORG'>Teagle Foundation</ent> which was set up before Teagle's death.  
  Like other fortunes, it had become part of the network.  </p>

<p>This text is being posted with the intent to EDUCATE those of you who
know not the silent and pervasive influence of your hidden masters. Some
have looked for shadows of the old illuminati; they look amiss, not seeing
that which is all around them. If you know not the "who" and the "why",
efforts will be mis-directed. This is NOT a "conspiracy"..nay, it is a
very cold and calculated <ent type='ORG'>NETWORK</ent> of individuals whose intent is nothing
short of implementation of a "New <ent type='ORG'>World Order</ent>"; an oligarchic rein in which
*you* serve as little more that slaves in their "technocracy". This network
has every intention to implement a cashless society, for it is they who
control every aspect of finance and banking over the entire globe. They
have had about 100 years to perfect their plans and put them into practice.
 
Please understand that the <ent type='NORP'>Bilderbergers</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>the Council</ent> on Foreign Relations,
the Tri-lateral Commission,<ent type='ORG'>the Institute for Policy Studies</ent>, the Roundtables,
the "Club of Rome",etc are ALL bound by common denominators of long-standing
families ties, and interests and come together as a _single_ policy making
body that is known today as "<ent type='ORG'>The Committee</ent> of 300" . This has also been
known as "The <ent type='NORP'>Olympians</ent>", the "<ent type='ORG'>Policy Committee</ent>".
 
Don't be mis-led by labels such as "<ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>" or "Rothschild"; for these
are simply the families who have the mechanisms of control already set in
place,but of themselves are not the entire network; that being the
"Committee of 300". It is THEY who control the UN, who tell the heads of
nations "when to jump and how high", they who are behind the world's illicit
drug trade via the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and the old <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> <ent type='LOC'>East India</ent> links. They who
manage the <ent type='ORG'>IMF</ent>,set policy at <ent type='ORG'>GATT</ent> conferences. It is they who ARE the
"<ent type='ORG'>Shadow Government</ent>". It is they who manage the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>,<ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>,<ent type='ORG'>DIA</ent>..the same
group that took out JFK and have MURDERED around 173 people in their efforts
to suppress the truth about all the links..they who were behind the
assassination of <ent type='ORG'>RFK</ent>,MLK..they who are behind the suppression of truth
regarding the <ent type='ORG'>MIA</ent>'s; It is the same group behind E. Howard Hunt,
John Singlaub, Ollie North..the very same group who brought down Richard
Nixon in Watergate..the same group behind the persecution of the <ent type='NORP'>Christic</ent>
Institute..the same people who were behind Nugan-Hand..the same group
that groomed Jimmy Carter for the Presidency..the same group who ARE
the "Military-Industrial complex", the same group behind the total
militarization of <ent type='ORG'>NASA</ent>..the same group who ARE "MJ-12", were behind the
"<ent type='ORG'>Jason Group</ent>"..the same behind <ent type='ORG'>Project Blue Book</ent>, The Condon Committee,
the same who started up the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>..who are responsible for the MURDER of
Danny Casalaro..the same group responsible for the world-wide DISINFO
campaign regarding the <ent type='ORG'>TRUTH</ent> of UFO sightings and contacts. The very
SAME group who OWN THE ME<ent type='ORG'>DIA</ent>..ie..<ent type='ORG'>The Washington Post</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>NBC</ent> (General
Electric),ABC,CBS,<ent type='ORG'>The New York Times</ent>,etc. The same group behind the
the Warren Commission,ad nauseum..
 
I DO believe I could make a DIRECT connection here with just what 
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>BASE says on WACKENHUT that also ties in the <ent type='ORG'>Shadow Government</ent>
with UFO related installations; this is but *ONE* connection..there
are many,many more that can be and will be ferreted out for exposure.</p>

<p>Message #6041 - INFO.PARANET

 From : Don Ecker
   To : John Galt
Subject : Wackenhut
John Galt said:</p>

<p> &gt; <ent type='ORG'>Wackenhut Corp</ent>., one of the nation's largest security firms, said Friday
 &gt; it has bought the U.S. security operations of <ent type='ORG'>ISS International</ent> Service
 &gt; System Inc.  The purchase price was not disclosed.  <ent type='ORG'>ISS International</ent>
 &gt; has more than 700 employees in its U.S. security operations, primarily
 &gt; in <ent type='GPE'>Jacksonville</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Atlanta</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Cleveland</ent> and
 &gt; <ent type='GPE'>Chattanooga</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Tenn</ent>.</p>

<p>In several investigations that I am currently involved in for <ent type='ORG'>UFO Magazine</ent> as
well as my radio show "UFOs Tonite", I have come across the Wackenhut
connection. As many of you may know, Wackenhut is responsible for outside
security around <ent type='LOC'>Area</ent> 51 and site S-4. Last year there was a helicopter crash
in <ent type='GPE'>Las Vegas</ent> that killed a number of Wackenhut employees, plus they are
involved in the Inslaw scandel. At any rate much more than I can go into here.

<p>This information was reported in the June 24, 1991 issue of "THE SPOTLIGHT".</p>

<p>This is not the entire article, only the highlights.  If you would like to
read this article in its entirety please refer to the above publication.</p>

<div>    ----------------------------</div>

<p>The word out of the Bilderberg annual meeting is that there will be another
war within the next five years.</p>

<p>It was repeatedly stated at the Bilderberg meeting that there will be 
"other Saddams" in the years ahead who must be dealt with swiftly and 
efficiently.</p>

<p>The Bilderberg group plans a global army at the disposal of the United 
Nations.  It is their hope that the U.N. will become the world government
by the year 2000.</p>

<p>"A U.N. army must be able to act immediately, anywhere in the world, without
delays involved in each country making its own decision whether to
participate, based on parochial considerations," said Henry Kissinger.</p>

<p>If <ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent> can be persuaded to surrender warmaking decisions to the U.N.,
"parochial nationalism" in <ent type='NORP'>Briton</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> and elsewhere will disappear,
Bilderberg speakers said.</p>

<p>"The <ent type='LOC'>Persian Gulf</ent> venture has advanced the cause by years" one speaker said.</p>

<p>So there you have it, the "One Worlders" are still alive and well.</p>

<p>The following is on the historical perspective of just the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>

encourage you to perform your own investigation. To that end,I've
provided an extensive list of reading materials at the end of this
text. 
 
And lastly, I would include a very lucid assessment of our situation
by John DiNardo, which in my opinion, is absolutely correct. There have
been MANY people who are posting such as John, Dave Radcliffe, Rich
Winkel and others who have been showing you just *<ent type='ORG'>WHO</ent>* the CANCER IS.</p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If the usurpers of our freedom, the plunderers of our life's earnings,
  the despoilers of our planet <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent>, the deluders of our TV-zombified
  society, the desecrators of our Constitution can crush the <ent type='NORP'>Christic</ent> 
  Institute -- than what refuge is left for the few remaining 
  <ent type='NORP'>Christic</ent>-like organizations to shelter THEM from this Frankenstein
  Monster government?  What refuge is left for you and me, and for our
  children who will necessarily find themselves forced to riot and
  spill their blood in the streets during the twenty-first century? 
  It always degenerates to that, you know.</p>

<p>  We <ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent> are a lazy, short-sighted bunch. We realize that if we
  don't earn a living, we will be impoverished. We realize that if we
  don't brush our teeth, our teeth will rot out of our mouths. We 
  realize that if we don't service our cars, they will fail to operate.
  Yet, we don't realize -- or we're too lazy to admit -- that if we
  don't supervise and participate in our system of government to ensure
  that our Constitution is protected from the greedy, power-mad 
  neurotics whose ambitions drive them to seize the reins of power 
  and wealth vested in our <ent type='ORG'>Federal Government</ent>, then our libertarian 
  foundations will crumble beneath us, leaving us to fall into the
  pit of subjugation that the corporate rulers have prepared for us.</p>

<p>  As we witness our free-fall into the pit, we finally understand
  that the law is slipping out of our hands; that we and our children
  will have to resort to meeting in dark rooms and plotting to recover
  our Constitutional freedoms which the usurpers have seized through
  television, that great national <ent type='NORP'>Svengali</ent> -- that opiate of the masses 
  which they have so cleverly employed to sedate, delude and distract us
  while quietly cuffing our ankles and wrists. How could we be so stupid
  as to surrender our minds to Big Brother, never suspecting that 
  whenever someone offers you free entertainment, day after day and
  year after year, it's got to be costing you.  </p>

<p>  Why shouldn't we be as vulnerable to totalitarianism as are
  the peoples of most other societies around the world. More so, 
  considering the fact that totalitarianism originates from within the 
  military elite. And whose nation has the most savagely powerful  
  military force on the planet?  What's worse is that it's not just the
  military that's militating against our Constitutional freedoms.
  It's the military-industrial complex. President Eisenhower left office
  a third of a century ago by warning us that the military-industrial
  complex is the greatest threat to our freedom. That was as much of
  a warning as he dared give, lest he meet the doom of his valiant 
  successor who tried to actually BE the President of <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>.</p>

<p>  How knowledgeable was <ent type='ORG'>the General</ent> of the <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> of the Second World War,
  Dwight Eisenhower, in his fear of the military-industrial complex?
  As knowledgeable as President Kennedy is dead!</p>

<p>  So you see, there really isn't much time left. If we prove to be too
  lazy now to unite behind Constitutional upholders such as the
  <ent type='NORP'>Christic</ent> Institute -- then our children in the twenty-first century
  will NOT be too frightened to stand up against the bullets of the
  Wackenhut Security Corporation of Coral Gables, <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>. Because
  when the oppression becomes intolerable, you, I and anyone would 
  stand up to bullets, rather than go on living in unbearable agony.
  Ask the <ent type='NORP'>Palestinian</ent> people who stand up to bullets every day --
  or the <ent type='NORP'>Rumanian</ent> people, or the <ent type='NORP'>Guatemalan</ent> people, or the <ent type='NORP'>Filipino</ent> 
  people, or the <ent type='NORP'>Chinese</ent> people, or the <ent type='NORP'>Iranian</ent> people, or the
  <ent type='NORP'>Tibetan</ent> people, or the <ent type='NORP'>Timorese</ent> people.</p>

<p>  If we prove to be too lazy now, OUR generation may even see the day
  when citizens will speak softly and listen intently for the footsteps
  of the <ent type='ORG'>Gestapo</ent> who may finally come to kick down our front door and
  arrest us for plotting to regain the Constitutional freedoms 
  that were once our heritage.</p>

<p>  *** The <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent> ***</p>

<div>  ========================================================================</div>

<p>  Many <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> conservatives believe as a matter of faith that the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s and <ent type='ORG'>the Council</ent> on Foreign Relations exercise absolute 
  control over the government and the people of the U.S.  This thesis can 
  be accepted as a working formula if one remains conscious of the larger 
  issues.  Two writers for whom the present writer (E.M) has great respect, 
  Dr. Emanuel Josephson and Morris Bealle, insisted on focusing on the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s and excluding all other aspects of the <ent type='ORG'>World Order</ent>. This 
  severely limited the effect of their otherwise groundbreaking work on the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Medical Monopoly</ent>. This writer advanced a contrary view in "<ent type='ORG'>The World</ent> 
  Order," fixing upon the Rothschild monetary power, which reached a point 
  of world control by 1885, and its <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> policy group, the Royal 
  Institute of International Affairs, as the policy makers for what has 
  essentially been, since 1900, a re-established colonial government, 
  functions primarily through <ent type='ORG'>the Council</ent> on Foreign Relations, but only as 
  the subsidiary of <ent type='ORG'>RIIA</ent> and through the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation, which 
  controls government functions, the educational establishments, the media, 
  the religions and the state legislatures.  </p>

<p>  It is true that the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> colonials have "free elections," in which 
  they have the absolute right to vote for one of two opposing candidates, 
  both of whom have been handpicked and financed by the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> 
  syndicate.  This touching evidence of "democracy" serves to convince most 
  <ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent> that you are indeed a free people.  You even have a cracked 
  <ent type='ORG'>Liberty Bell</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Philadelphia</ent> to prove it.  <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> youths have been free 
  since 1900 to be marched off to die in <ent type='NORP'>Hegelian</ent> wars in which both 
  combatants received their instructions from the <ent type='ORG'>World Order</ent>. You are free 
  to invest in a stock market in which the daily quantity,price and value 
  of the monetary unit is manipulated and controlled by a Federal Reserve 
  System which is answerable only to <ent type='ORG'>the Bank</ent> of England. It has maintained 
  its vaunted "independence" from your government control, but this is the 
  only independence it has ever had.  </p>

<p>  The realization that you do indeed live under the dictates of the 
  "<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent>" can well be the starting point of the long road 
  back of a genuine struggle for <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> independence.  In exposing "the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s" as agents of a foreign power, which is not merely a foreign 
  power, but a genuine world government, you must realize that this is not 
  merely a group dedicated to making money, but a group which is committed 
  to maintaining the power of a colonial form of government over the 
  <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> people.  Thus the ancient calumny of John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> as a 
  man obsessed by greed (a category in which he has plenty of company) 
  obscures the fact that from the day the Rothschilds began to finance his 
  march towards a total oil monopoly in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> from their 
  coffers at <ent type='ORG'>the National City Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Cleveland</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> was never an 
  independent power, nor does any department of the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent> 
  operate as an independent power.  You know that the <ent type='ORG'>Cosa Nostra</ent>, or 
  <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>, with which the <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent> is closely allied, has somewhat 
  autonomous power in the regions which have been assigned to that 
  particular "family" by the national directors, but this always implies 
  that that family remains under total control and answerable for 
  everything which occurs in its territory.  </p>

<p>  Similarly, the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent> operates under clearly defined 
  spheres of influence.  The "charitable" organizations, the business 
  companies and the policy groups, always meld into a working operation, 
  nor can any department of the <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent> strike out on its own or 
  formulate an independent policy, no matter what may be its 
  justification.  </p>

<p>  The <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent> operates under the control of the world 
  financial structure, which means that on any given day, all of its assets 
  could be rendered close to worthless by adroit financial manipulation.  
  This is the final control, which ensures that no one can quit the 
  organization.  Not only would he be stripped of all assets, but he would 
  be under contract for immediate assassination.  <ent type='ORG'>The Department</ent> of Justice 
  is well aware that the only "terrorists" operating in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> 
  are the agents of the <ent type='ORG'>World Order</ent>, but they prudently avoid any mention 
  of this fact.  </p>

<p>  The world financial structure, far from being an unknown or hidden 
  organization, is actually well known and well defined.  It consists of 
  the major <ent type='NORP'>Swiss</ent> Banks; the survivors of the old <ent type='NORP'>Venetian</ent>-<ent type='NORP'>Genoese</ent> banking 
  axis; <ent type='ORG'>the Big Five</ent> of the world grain trade; the <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> combine, 
  centered in <ent type='ORG'>the Bank</ent> of England and its chartered merchant banks, 
  functioning through the Rothschilds and the <ent type='ORG'>Oppenheimers</ent> and having 
  absolute control over their <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> colony through <ent type='ORG'>the Royal Bank</ent> of 
  Canada and <ent type='ORG'>the Bank</ent> of Montreal, their <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> lieutenants being the 
  Bronfmans, Belzbergs, Reichmanns and other financial operators; and the 
  colonial banking structure in the U.S., controlled by <ent type='ORG'>the Bank</ent> of England 
  through the <ent type='ORG'>Federal Reserve System</ent>; the <ent type='GPE'>Boston</ent> Brahmin families who made 
  their fortunes in the opium trade, including the Delanos and others and 
  the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Bank, <ent type='ORG'>Chase Manhattan Bank</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Express, the present 
  form of the old Rothschild representatives in the U.S., which includes 
  <ent type='ORG'>Kuhn</ent>,Loeb Company and <ent type='ORG'>Lehman Brothers</ent>.  </p>

<p>  It is notable that the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent> is far down on the list of 
  the worlds financial structure.  Why then is it of such importance?  
  Although it is not the crucial factor in financial decision in the 
  <ent type='LOC'>Western Hemisphere</ent>, it is the actual working control mechanism of the 
  <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> colony.  The <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> family themselves,like the 
  Morgans,Schiffs and Warburgs, have faded into insignificance, but the 
  mechanism created in their name roars along at full power,still 
  maintaining all of the functions for which it was organized.  Since he 
  set up the <ent type='ORG'>Trilateral Commission</ent>, David <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> has functioned as a 
  sort of international courier for the <ent type='ORG'>World Order</ent>, principally concerned 
  with delivering working instructions to the <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> bloc,either 
  directly, in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> or by traveling to the area.  Laurence <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> 
  is active in the operation of the <ent type='ORG'>Medical Monopoly</ent>, but his principal 
  interests are in operating various vacation spas in tropical areas.  They 
  are the two survivors of the "Fortunate Five," the five sons of John D. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, Jr. and Abby Aldrich. John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, Jr. died in an 
  institution in <ent type='GPE'>Tucson</ent>,<ent type='GPE'>Arizona</ent> and was hastily cremated.  John D. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> III died in a mysterious accident on a <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> Parkway near 
  his home.  Nelson <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, named after his grandfather, died in the 
  arms of a TV journalist.  It was later revealed that he had also been in 
  the arms of another TV journalist at the same time; the death was hushed 
  up for many hours.  It was generally believed that he ran afoul of his 
  <ent type='NORP'>Columbian</ent> drug connection, the disagreement hardly being trivial; it 
  involved several billion dollars in drug profits which had not been 
  properly apportioned.  Winthrop <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> died an alcoholic in the arms 
  of his black boy friend.  He had been interviewed on television by Harry 
  Reasoner to explain his hasty move from <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> to <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent>. Winthrop 
  learned that his black boy friend, an <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> sergeant who apparently taught 
  him the mysteries of drill,refused to live in <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>. To celebrate this 
  alliance, Winthrop <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> gave magnificiently to <ent type='ORG'>Negro</ent> 
  causes,including the <ent type='ORG'>Urban League</ent> building on East 48th Street in New 
  York. A plaque on the second floor notes that it was his gift; it might 
  well have stated "From Hadrian to his Antinous."  </p>

<p>  We do not wish to imply that the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s no longer have influence, 
  but that the major policy dictates of the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent> are 
  handed down by other caps, of whom they continue to be a visible force.  
  Through the person of David <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, the family is sometimes called 
  "the first family of <ent type='GPE'>the Soviet Union</ent>." Only he and Dr. Armand Hammer, 
  the moving force behind USTEC, have permanent permission to land their 
  private planes at the <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent> Airport. Others would suffer the fate of <ent type='ORG'>KAL</ent> 
  007. David <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s most significant trip to <ent type='GPE'>the Soviet Union</ent> may 
  have been the fateful day when he landed in <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent>, having been told to 
  inform <ent type='NORP'>Khrushchev</ent> that he was "through". The <ent type='NORP'>Russians</ent> are very health 
  conscious, and a scientist had sent information to <ent type='NORP'>Khrushchev</ent> that the 
  use of chemical fertilizers in <ent type='GPE'>the Soviet Union</ent> presented a threat to the 
  people.  <ent type='NORP'>Khrushchev</ent> then announced a major change in the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> farm 
  policy, centering around a reduction in the use of chemicals.  This was 
  upsetting to the head of the world's <ent type='ORG'>Chemical Fertilizer</ent> trust, David 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, and he responded with a terse one word command, "Out".  </p>

<p>  Both the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> family fortune and the considerable portion set 
  aside in the foundations of the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Syndicate</ent></ent> are effectively 
  insulated against any type of government control.  <ent type='ORG'>FORTUNE</ent> magazine noted 
  August ,1986, that John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>,Jr.  had created trusts in 1934 
  which now amounted to some $2.3 billion; another 200 million had been set 
  aside for the Abby <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> branch.  The five sons had trusts which in 
  1986 amounted to $2.1 billion.  These trusts had originally amounted to 
  only $50 million each,showing the increase in their assets as well as 
  inflation during the ensuing half century.  <ent type='ORG'>FORTUNE</ent> estimated the 1986 
  total <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> wealth as $3.5 billion of which $900 million was in 
  securities and real estate.  They owned 45% of the Time Life 
  Building; Nelson <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>International Basic Economy Corporation</ent> had 
  been sold to a <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> company in 1980. For years, the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> family 
  had deliberately kept the rents low in its major holding, <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> 
  Center, a $1.6 billion investment yielding an annual return of 1% . This 
  was a convenient <ent type='ORG'>manuever</ent> for tax purposes, and a good one at that.  </p>

<p>  Much of the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> wealth might be attributed to old John D.'s 
  rapacity and ruthlessness; its origins are indubitably based in his 
  initial financing from <ent type='ORG'>the National City Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Cleveland</ent>, which was 
  identified in <ent type='ORG'>Congressional</ent> reports as one of the three Rothschild banks 
  in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> and by his later acceptance of the guidance of Jacob 
  Schiff of <ent type='ORG'>Kuhn</ent>,Loeb Company, who had been born in the Rothschild house in 
  <ent type='GPE'>Franfort</ent> and was now the principal Rothschild representive (but unknown 
  as such to the public) in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>.  </p>

<p>  With the seed money from <ent type='ORG'>the National City Bank</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Cleveland</ent>, old John D. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> soon laid claim to the title of the "most ruthless <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>". 
  It is more than likely that it was this quality which persuaded the 
  Rothschilds to back him.  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> realized early in the game that the 
  oil refinery business, which could offer great profits in a short time, 
  also was at the mercy of uncontrolled competition.  His solution was a 
  simple one--crush all competition.  The famous <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> dedication to 
  total monopoly was simply a business decision.  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> embarked on a 
  campaign of coercing all competing oil refineries out of business.  He 
  attacked on a number of fronts, which is also a lesson to all would be 
  entrepreneurs.  First, he would send a minion, not known to be working for 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, with an offer to buy the competing refinery for a low 
  price,but offering cash.  If the offer was refused, the competitor would 
  then come under attack from a competing refinery which greatly undercut 
  his price.  He might also suffer a sudden strike at his refinery,which 
  would force him to shut down.  Control of labor through unions has always 
  been a basic <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> technique.  Like <ent type='GPE'>the Soviet Union</ent>, they seldom 
  have labor trouble.  If these techniques failed, <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> would then 
  be saddened by a reluctant decision to use violence; beating the rival 
  workers as they went to and from their jobs, or burning or blowing up the 
  competing refinery.  </p>

<p>  These techniques convinced the Rothschilds that they had found their 
  man.They sent their personal representative,Jacob Schiff, to <ent type='GPE'>Cleveland</ent> to 
  help <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> plan further expansion.  At this time,the Rothschilds 
  controlled 95% of all railroad mileage in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>,through the 
  J.P. <ent type='ORG'>Morgan Company</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Kuhn Loeb Company</ent>,according to official 
  Department of Commerce figures for the year 1895. J.P. Morgan mentions in 
  his "Who's Who" listing that he controlled 50000 miles of U.S. 
  railways.  Schiff worked out an elaborate rebate deal for 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>,through a dummy corporation,<ent type='ORG'>South Improvement Company</ent>. These 
  rebates ensured that no other oil company could survive in competition 
  with the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> firm.  The scheme was later exposed,but by that time 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had achieved a virtual monopoly of the oil business in the 
  U.S. The daughter of one of his victims, Ida Tarbell,whose father was 
  ruined by <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s criminal operations, wrote the first major expose 
  of <ent type='ORG'>the Standard Oil Trust</ent>. She was promptly denounced as a "muckracker" 
  by the poseur, Theodore Roosevelt, who claimed to be a "trustbuster." In 
  fact, he ensured the dominance of <ent type='ORG'>the Standard Oil Trust</ent> and other giant 
  trusts.  </p>

<p>  During the next half century, John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> was routinely 
  caricatured by socialist propagandists as the epitome of the ruthless 
  capitalist.  At the same time, he was the principal financier of the 
  world <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> movement, through a firm called <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> International 
  Company. Despite the fact that <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> of Rothschild had already 
  achieved world control,the sound and the fury was directed exclusively 
  against its two principal representatives,John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> and J.P. 
  Morgan.  One of the few revelations of the actual state of affairs 
  appeared in <ent type='ORG'>TRUTH</ent> magazine,Dec 161912, which pointed out that "Mr. 
  Schiff is head of the great private banking house of <ent type='ORG'>Kuhn</ent>, Loeb Company 
  (I knew some of you bright readers would finally pick up that these names 
  are all attached to the greatest pharmaceutical firms in the world--even 
  into your very vitamin supplement business!), which represents the 
  Rothschild interests on your side of the <ent type='LOC'>Atlantic</ent>. He is described as a 
  financial strategist and has been for years the financial minister of the 
  great impersonal power known as <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent>."  Note that the name of 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> was not mentioned in the quote.  </p>

<p>  Because of these concealed factors,it was a relatively simple matter for 
  the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> public to accept the "fact" that the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s were the 
  preeminent power in your country.  This myth was actually clothed in the 
  apparel of power,the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Oil Trust becoming the 
  "military-industrial complex" which assumed political control of the 
  nation; the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Medical Monopoly</ent> attained control of the health 
  care of the nation, and the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation, a web of affiliated 
  tax emempt creations, effectively controlled the religious and 
  educational life of the nation.  The myth succeeded in its goal of 
  camouflaging the hidden rulers, the Rothschilds.  </p>

<p>  After Eustis Mullins and a few others, had been exposing this charade for 
  some twenty-five years a new myth began to be noised about in <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> 
  conservative circles, effectively propagated by active double agents.  
  This myth found a host of eager believers,because it heralded a growing 
  crack in the monolithic power which had been oppressing all the peoples 
  of the world.  This "new" revelation was that a struggle to the death for 
  world power had developed between the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s and the Rothschilds. 
  According to this startling development, one faction or the other, 
  depending on which agent you were listening to, had gained control of the 
  <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union and would use its power as the basis for achieving the 
  overthrow of the other faction.  The sudden death of several members of 
  the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> family was cited as "proof" that such a struggle was 
  taking place, although no Rothschild is known to have succumbed during 
  this "war." This ignored the general understanding that Nelson 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had been "eliminated" as the result of losing deposit slips 
  for several billion dollars of drugs from the <ent type='NORP'>Columbian</ent> cartel, or that 
  the other <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> deaths showed no trace of a "Rothschild 
  connection."  </p>

<p>  Having maintained extensive files on this situation for several decades, 
  the writer (E.M.),could not believe anyone could be so misinformed as to 
  think that "the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s" were now trying to seize power from the 
  Rothschilds, at a time when the influence of members of the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> 
  family was already in great decline, their family finances being handled 
  by John J. McCloy, and other faithful retainers;none of the retainers 
  would have been willing to engage in a genuine power struggle, as they 
  were faceless managers who lived only for their weekly paycheck.  They 
  had no ambitions of their own.  Nevertheless, many hopeful <ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent> 
  grasped at the will-o-the-wisp notion the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s were now "good 
  <ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent>" who were willing to risk all to overthrow the Rothschilds. 
  Amazingly enough, this pernicious story persisted for almost a decade 
  before being relegated to the curiosities of history.  </p>

<p>  Like J.P. Morgan, who had begun his commercial career by selling the U.S. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Army</ent> some defective guns, the famous Hall carbine affair, John D. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> also was a war profiteer during the Civil War;he sold 
  unstamped Harkness liquor to Federal troops at a high profit, gaining the 
  initial capital to embark on his drive for monopoly.  His interest in the 
  oil business was a natural one; his father,William <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had been 
  "in oil" for years.  William <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had become an oil entrepreneur 
  after salt wells at <ent type='ORG'>Tarentum</ent>, near <ent type='GPE'>Pittsburgh</ent>, were discovered in 1842 to 
  be flowing with oil.  The owners of the wells,Samuel L. Kier, began to 
  bottle the oil and sell it for medicinal purposes.  One of his earliest 
  wholesalers was William <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>. The "medicine" was originally 
  labelled "Kier's Magic Oil". <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> printed his own labels, using 
  "<ent type='ORG'>Rock Oil</ent>" or "Seneca Oil", Seneca being the name of a well known <ent type='NORP'>Indian</ent> 
  Tribe. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> achieved his greatest notoriety and his greatest 
  profits by advertising himself as "William <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, the Celebrated 
  Cancer Specialist".  It is understandable that his grandsons would become 
  the controlling power behind the scenes of the world's most famous cancer 
  treatment center and would direct government funds and charitable 
  contributions to those areas which only benefit the <ent type='ORG'>Medical Monopoly</ent>. 
  William <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> spared no claim in his flamboyant career.  He 
  guaranteed "All Cases of Cancer Cured Unless They Are Too Far Gone". Such 
  were the healing powers that he attributed to his magic cancer cure that 
  he was able to retail it for $25 a bottle, a sum then equivalent to two 
  month's wages.  The "cure" consisted of a few well known diuretics, which 
  had been diluted by water.  This carnival medicine show barker could 
  hardly have envisioned that his descendants would control the greatest 
  and the most profitable <ent type='ORG'>Medical Monopoly</ent> in recorded history.  </p>

<p>  As an itinerant "carnie", a traveling carnival peddler, William 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had chosen a career which interfered with developing a stable 
  family life.  His son, John, rarely saw him, a circumstance which has 
  inspired some psychological analysts to conjecture that the absence of a 
  father figure or parental love may have contributed to John D. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s subsequent development as a money mad tyrant who plotted to 
  maim, poison and kill millions of his fellow <ent type='NORP'>Americans</ent> during almost a 
  century of his monopolistic operations and whose influence, reaching up 
  from the grave, remains the most dire and malignant presence in <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> 
  life.  This may have been a contributing factor--however, it is also 
  possible that he was totally evil.  It is hardly arguable that he is 
  probably one of the most Satanic figures in <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> history.  Evil being 
  defined as anything that moves the spiritual aspect of beingness away 
  from God as influenced through another.  </p>

<p>  It has long been a truism that you can find a horse thief or two in any 
  prominent <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> family.  In the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> family, it was more than 
  true in the case of William who seemed to have faithfully followed the 
  precepts of the Will of <ent type='GPE'>Canaan</ent> throughout his career, "love robbery, love 
  lechery".  He fled from a number of indictments for horse stealing and 
  you know how serious that is, finally disappearing altogether as William 
  and <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> and magically re-emerging as a Dr. William Levingston of 
  <ent type='GPE'>Philadelphia</ent>, a name which he retained for the rest of his life.  An 
  investigative reporter at Joseph Pulitzer's <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> World received a tip 
  that was followed up.  <ent type='ORG'>The World</ent> then disclosed that William Avery 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had died May 11, 1906 in <ent type='GPE'>Freeport</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Illinois</ent>, where he was 
  interred in an unmarked grave as Dr. William Levingston.  </p>

<p>  William <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s vocation as a medicine man greatly facilitated his 
  preferred profession of horse thief.  As one who planned to be in the 
  next county by morning, it was a simple matter to tie a handsome stallion 
  to the back of his wagon and head for the open road.  It also played a 
  large part in his vocation as a woman-chaser; he was described as being 
  "woman-mad".  </p>

<p>  On June 281849, he was indicted for raping a hired girl in Cayuga,New 
  York; he later was found to be residing in <ent type='GPE'>Oswego</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> and was 
  forced once again to decamp for parts unknown.  He had no difficulty in 
  financing his woman-chasing interests from the sale of his miraculous 
  cancer cure and from another product, his "Wonder Working Liniment", 
  which he offered at only two dollars a bottle.  It consisted of crude 
  petroleum from which the lighter oils had been boiled away, leaving a 
  heavy solution of paraffin,lube oil and tar, which comprised the 
  "liniment". William <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s original miracle oil survived until 
  quite recently as a concoction called <ent type='ORG'>Nujol</ent>, consisting principally of 
  petroleum and peddled as a laxative.  It was well known that <ent type='ORG'>Nujol</ent> was 
  merely an advertising sobriquet meaning "new oil", as opposed apparently, 
  to "old oil".  Sold as an antidote to constipation, it robbed the body of 
  fat-soluble vitamins, it being a well-established medical fact that 
  mineral oil coated the intestine and prevented the absorption of many 
  needed vitamins and other nutritional needs.  Its makers added carotine 
  as a sop to the health-conscious, but it was hardly worth the bother.  
  <ent type='ORG'>Nujol</ent> was manufactured by a subsidiary of <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent>, 
  called Stanco, whose only other product, manufactured on the same 
  premises, was the famous insecticide, Flit.  </p>

<p>  <ent type='ORG'>Nujol</ent> was hawked from <ent type='ORG'>the Senate Office Building</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> for years 
  during a more liberal interpretation of "conflict of interest".  In this 
  case, it was hardly a conflict of interest, because the august 
  peddler,Senator Royal S. Copeland, never had any interests other than 
  serving the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s.  He was a physician whom <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had 
  appointed as head of the <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> State Department of Health and later 
  financed his campaign for the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent>.  Copeland's frank display of 
  commercialism amazed even the most blase' <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> reporters.  </p>

<p>  He devoted his <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> career to a daily program advertising <ent type='ORG'>Nujol</ent>. A 
  microphone was set up in his <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> office each morning, the first order 
  of business being the <ent type='ORG'>Nujol</ent> program, for which he was paid $75000 a 
  year, an enormous salary in the 1930's and more than the salary of the 
  President of <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>. Senator Copeland's exploits earned him a 
  number of nicknames on <ent type='ORG'>Capital Hill</ent>. He was often called the Senator from 
  the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> Medical Association, because of his enthusiastic backing for 
  any program launched by the <ent type='ORG'>AMA</ent> and Morris Fishbein. More realistically, 
  he was usually referred to as "the Senator from <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent>". He could 
  be counted on to promote any legislation devised for the greater profit 
  of the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> monopoly.  During congressional debate on the Food and 
  Drug Act in 1938, he came under criticism from <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>woman Leonor 
  Sullivan, who charged that Senator Copeland, a physician who handled the 
  bill on the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> floor, frankly acknowledged during the debate that 
  soap was exempted from the law because the soap manufacturers, who were 
  the nation's largest advertisers, would otherwise join with other big 
  industries to fight the bill.  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>woman Sullivan complained that, 
  "Soap was officially declared in the law not to be a cosmetic.  The hair 
  dye manufacturers were given a license to market known dangerous 
  products, just so long as they placed a special warning on the label - 
  but what woman in a beauty parlor ever sees the label on the bulk 
  container in which hair dye is shipped?"  </p>

<p>  Just as the elder <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had spent his life in the pursuit of his 
  personal obsession, women, so his son John was equally obsessed, being 
  money-mad instead of woman-mad, totally committed to the pursuit of 
  ever-increasing wealth and power.  However, the principal accomplishments 
  of the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> drive for power, the rebate scheme for monopoly, the 
  chartering of the foundations to gain power over <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> citizens,the 
  creation of the central bank, the <ent type='ORG'>Federal Reserve System</ent>, the backing of 
  the World <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> Revolution and the creation of the Medical Monoply, 
  all came from the Rothschilds or from their <ent type='NORP'>European</ent> employees.  </p>

<p>  We cannot find in the records of John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> that he originated 
  any of these programs.  The concept of the tax exempt charitable 
  foundation originated with the Rothschild minion, George Peabody, in 
  1865. <ent type='ORG'>The Peabody Educational Foundation</ent> later became the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> 
  Foundation and many of you should recall that item.  Not that you might 
  have been around then but it continues to inadvertently be referred to as 
  such.  </p>

<p>  It is unlikely that even the diabolical mind of John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> could 
  have conceived of this devious twist.  A social historian has described 
  the major development of the late nineteenth century, when charitable 
  foundations and world Communism became important movements, as one of the 
  more interesting facets of history, perhaps equivalent to the discovery 
  of the wheel or fire.  This new discovery was the concept developed by 
  the rats, who after all have rather highly developed intelligences, that 
  they could trap people by baiting traps with little bits of cheese.  The 
  history of mankind since then has been the rats catching humans in their 
  traps.  Socialism -- indeed, any government program -- is simply the rat 
  baiting the trap with a smidgeon of cheese and catching himself a human.  </p>

<p>  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>man Wright Patman, chairman of <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> Banking and Currency 
  Committee, noted from the floor of <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> that the establishment of the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation effectively insulated <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> from 
  competition.  The controlling stock had been removed from market 
  manipulation or possible buyouts by competitors.  It also relieved 
  <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> from most taxation, which then placed a tremendous added 
  burden on individual <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> taxpayers.  Although a <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> relative 
  by marriage, Senator Nelson Aldrich, <ent type='NORP'>Republican</ent> majority leader in the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent>, had pushed <ent type='ORG'>the General</ent> Education Board charter through <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, 
  the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Foundation charter proved to be more difficult.  
  Widespread criticism of <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s monopolistic practices was heard, 
  and his effort to insulate his profits from taxation or takeover was seen 
  for what it was.  The charter was finally pushed through in 1913 (the 
  significant <ent type='ORG'>Masonic</ent> numeral 13 -- 1913 was also the year of the 
  progressive income tax and of the enactment of <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Reserve Act</ent>). 
  Senator Robert F. Wagner of <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>, another Senator from <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> 
  (there were quite a few), ramrodded the <ent type='ORG'>Congressional</ent> approval of the 
  charter.  The charter was then signed by John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, John D. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, Jr., Henry Pratt Judson, president of the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> 
  established University of Chicago,Simon Flexner, director of the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Institute, Starr Jameson, described in "Who's Who" as 
  "personal counsel to John D. <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> in his benevolences", and 
  Charles W. Eliot, president of <ent type='ORG'>Harvard University</ent>.  </p>

<p>  The <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> Oil Monopoly is now 127 years old, yet in 1911, the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent>, bowing to public outrage, had ruled that it had to be 
  broken up.  The resulting companies proved to be no problem for the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> interests.  The family retained a two per cent holding in 
  each of the "new" companies, while the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> foundations took a 
  three per cent holding in each company.  This gave them a five per cent 
  stock interest in each company; a one per cent holding in a corporation 
  is usually sufficient to maintain working control.  </p>

<p>  The involvement of the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s in promoting the World <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> 
  Revolution also developed from their business interests.  There was never 
  any commitment to the <ent type='NORP'>Marxist</ent> ideology; like anything else, it was there 
  to be used.  At the turn of the century, <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> was competing 
  fiercely with <ent type='ORG'>Royal Dutch Shell</ent> for control of the lucrative <ent type='NORP'>European</ent> 
  market.  <ent type='ORG'>Congressional</ent> testimony revealed that <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> had sent large 
  sums of money to Lenin and Trotsky to instigate the <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> Revolution 
  in 1905. His banker, Jacob Schiff had previously financed the <ent type='NORP'>Japanese</ent> in 
  their war against <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> and had sent a personal emissary, George Kennan 
  to <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> to spend some twenty years in promoting revolutionary activity 
  against the Czar.  </p>

<p>  When the 1905 revolution failed, Lenin was placed "in storage" in 
  <ent type='GPE'>Switzerland</ent> until 1907. Trotsky was brought to the U.S., where he lived 
  rent free on the <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> property at <ent type='GPE'>Bayonne</ent>,<ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent>, its tank 
  field.  When the Czar abdicated, Trotsky was placed on a ship with three 
  hundred <ent type='NORP'>Communist</ent> revolutionaries from <ent type='LOC'>the Lower East Side</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>. 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> obtained a special passport for Trotsky from Woodrow Wilson 
  and sent Lincoln Steffens with him to make sure he was returned safely to 
  <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent>. For traveling expenses, <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> placed a purse containing 
  $10000 in Trotsky's pocket.  </p>

<p>  On April 131917, when the ship stopped in <ent type='GPE'>Halifax</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> Secret 
  Service officers immediately arrested Trotsky and interred him in Nova 
  Scotia. The case became an international cause celebre, as leading 
  government officials from several nations frantically demanded Trotsky's 
  release.  <ent type='ORG'>The Secret Service</ent> had been tipped off that Trotsky was on his 
  way to take <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> out of the war, freeing more <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> armies to attack 
  <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> troups on the Western Front.  </p>

<p>  Prime Minister Lloyd George hurriedly cabled orders from <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> to the 
  <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> Secret Service to free Trotsky at once - they ignored him.  
  Trotsky was finally freed by the intervention of one of <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>'s 
  most faithful stooges, <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> Minister Mackenzie King, who had long 
  been a "labor specialist" for the <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s. King personally obtained 
  Trotsky's release and sent him on his way as the emissary of the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s, commissioned to win the Bolshevik Revolution.  Thus, Dr. 
  Armand Hammer, who loudly proclaimed his influence in <ent type='GPE'>Russia</ent> as the 
  friend of Lenin, has an insignificant claim compared to the role of the 
  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>s in backing world Communism.  </p>

<p>  Although Communism, like other "isms", had origined with Marx's 
  association with <ent type='ORG'>the House</ent> of Rothschild, it enlisted the reverent 
  support of John D.  <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> because he saw Communism for what it is, 
  the ultimate monopoly, not only controlling the government, the monetary 
  system and all property, but also a monopoly which, like the corporations 
  it emulates, is self-perpetuating and eternal.  It was the logical 
  progression from his <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> monopoly.  </p>

<p>  An important step on the road to world monopoly was the most far-reaching 
  corporation invented by the Rothschilds. This was the international drug 
  and chemical cartel, I. G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>. Called "a state within a state" , it 
  was created in 1925 as Interessen Gemeinschaft Farbeinindustrie Aktien 
  Gesellschaft, usually known simply as I. G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>, which simply meant 
  "The <ent type='ORG'>Cartel</ent>". It had originated in 1904, when the six major chemical 
  companies in <ent type='GPE'>Germany</ent> began negotiations to form the ultimate cartel, 
  merging Badische Anilin,Bayer,Agfa,Hoechst,Weiler-ter-Meer, and 
  Greisheim-Electron.  The guiding spirit,as well as the financing, came 
  from the Rothschilds, who were represented by their <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> banker, Max 
  Warburg of M. M. Warburg Company, <ent type='GPE'>Hamburg</ent>. He later headed the <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> 
  Secret Service during World War I and was personal financial advisor to 
  the Kaiser.  </p>

<p>  When the Kaiser was overthrown, after losing the war, Max Warburg was not 
  exiled with him to <ent type='GPE'>Holland</ent>; instead he became the financial advisor to 
  the new government.  </p>

<p>  Monarchs may come and go, but the real power remains with the bankers.  
  While representing <ent type='GPE'>Germany</ent> at the <ent type='GPE'>Paris</ent> Peace Conference, Max Warburg 
  spent pleasant hours renewing family ties with his brother, Paul Warburg, 
  who, after drafting <ent type='ORG'>the Federal Reserve Act</ent> at <ent type='GPE'>Jekyll Island</ent>, had headed 
  the U.S. banking system during the war.  He was in <ent type='GPE'>Paris</ent> as Woodrow 
  Wilson's financial advisor.  </p>

<p>  I. G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> soon had a net worth of six billion marks, controlling some 
  five hundred firms.  Its first president was Professor Carl Bosch. During 
  the period of <ent type='GPE'>the Weimar Republic</ent>, I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> officials,seeing the 
  handwriting, began a close association with one called Adolf Hitler, 
  supplying much needed funds and political influence.  </p>

<p>  The success of the I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> cartel had aroused the interest of other 
  industrialists.  Henry <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent> was favorably impressed and set up a <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> 
  branch of <ent type='ORG'>Ford Motor Company</ent>. Forty percent of the stock was purchased by 
  I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent>. I.G. <ent type='ORG'>Farben</ent> then established an <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> subsidiary called 
  <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> I.G., in cooperation with <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent>. Its 
  directors included Walter Teagle, President of <ent type='ORG'>Standard Oil</ent>, Paul Warburg 
  of <ent type='ORG'>Kuhn</ent>,Loeb Company and <ent type='ORG'>Edsel</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent>, representing the <ent type='ORG'>Ford</ent> interests.  
  John Foster Dulles, for the law firm, Sullivan and <ent type='ORG'>Cromwell</ent>, became the 
  attorney for I.G., frequently traveling between <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Berlin</ent> on 
  cartel business.  His law partner, Arthur Dean, is now director of the 
  $40 million <ent type='ORG'>Teagle Foundation</ent> which was set up before Teagle's death.  
  Like other fortunes, it had become part of the network.  </p>
