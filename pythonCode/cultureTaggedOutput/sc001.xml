Skolnick COMMENTARY #001
========================</p>

<p>Hi. Sherman Skolnik, Citizen's Committee to Clean Up the Courts, 
9800 Oglesby.</p>

<p>At one time the Pope owned three major banks in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>: New 
York, <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>San Francisco</ent>.</p>

<p>In <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent>, St. Peter's banker, Michael Saddona (sp?) ran the 
Franklin National Bank as a huge gambling device and money 
laundry. Result? The bank collapsed in 1974 and was taken over by 
a group of <ent type='NORP'>European</ent> banks with the Vatican losing *part* of their 
grip.</p>

<p>Saddona was sent to an <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>n prison for fraudulent banking. 
Later he was extradited to <ent type='GPE'>Italy</ent> on more charges. He began 
talking too much. The Pope silenced him in an <ent type='NORP'>Italian</ent> jail -- 
*murdered* with a poisoned cup of coffee. (By the way, the same 
method they used to murder <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> mayor Harold Washington, a 
poisoned cup of coffee, and replaced him with the Vatican's man 
of trust, Richie Daley.)</p>

<p>Saddona and his confederate successors also ran, for the Pope, 
<ent type='ORG'>the Continental Bank</ent> of <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>. All the <ent type='NORP'>Catholic</ent> churches of the 
Western Hemisphere run their money through that bank. After all, 
the archbishop of <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> is also the treasurer, for the <ent type='ORG'>Church</ent>, 
for all of North <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, Central <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> and South <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s, <ent type='ORG'>Continental Bank</ent>, through their holding 
company owed some $20 billion to the <ent type='NORP'>Japanese</ent>, including their 
mafia, the yakusa (sp?) who had put in slight capital. 
<ent type='ORG'>Continental</ent> could not repay, so the <ent type='NORP'>Japanese</ent> in May, 1984, 
started a run on the bank and its holding company, <ent type='ORG'>Continental</ent> 
<ent type='GPE'>Illinois</ent>. Result? A consortium of banks, headed by J.P. Morgan 
and Company, took over -- with the Pope losing *part*, but not 
all, of his control.</p>

<p>The Morgan banks are the front for <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> royalty and the Queen, 
who for over 100 years always had a director sitting to supervise 
<ent type='ORG'>Continental</ent>. Through <ent type='ORG'>Continental Bank</ent>, however, the Vatican 
continued to oversee <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>'s General Noriega, and his joint, 
secret business deals with George Bush. So, when the U.S. invaded 
<ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>, Noriega naturally sought refuge in the Vatican Embassy 
and branch of <ent type='ORG'>the Vatican Bank</ent>. The U.S. military used 
psychological warfare, including super hard-rock music to drive 
him out.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>The Justice Department</ent>'s record grabbers have descended on 
<ent type='ORG'>Continental Bank</ent>, seeking to destroy incriminating records that 
would put President Bush in the same jail cell with his <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> 
business partner, General Noriega. By the way, <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>, under 
General Noriega was the only country in <ent type='LOC'>the Western Hemisphere</ent> 
run by a dark-skinned person. Noriega was popular with the bulk 
of those *in* <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>, who are people of color. It was only the 
small, white aristocracy *there* that wanted him removed. They 
used the branches of worldwide banks there to skim off loot from 
dope and gun running. Noriega was really just a small-time, semi- 
independent tyrant.</p>

<p>Helping supervise <ent type='ORG'>Continental Bank</ent> has been the Vatican's man of 
trust, <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> federal appeals judge Walter Cummings (sp?), for 
many years also chief judge and major stockholder of the bank. 
Judge Cummings steers cases in his court to fellow banker/judges 
-- which is most of them.</p>

<p>For many years the major owners of Bank of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> and their 
holding company were the Jesuits and the Vatican, and their long- 
time cronies, the Rothschilds (sp?). Like <ent type='ORG'>Continental Bank</ent> up 
until 1984, they owed tens of billions of dollars to the <ent type='NORP'>Japanese</ent> 
and the yakusa, who own most of the other sizeable banks in 
<ent type='GPE'>California</ent>. In the late 1980s, Bank of <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> was faced with a 
run, so they have quietly given over most of the control to the 
<ent type='NORP'>Japanese</ent>.</p>

<p>Although the Pope has lost much of the control of the three banks 
in <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, the pontiff continues as the major owner in nuclear 
power utility firms, including <ent type='ORG'>Commonwealth Edison</ent> and Florida 
Power.</p>
