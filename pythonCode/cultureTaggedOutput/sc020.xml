<p>Skolnick COMMENTARY #020
========================</p>

<p>[<ent type='ORG'>CfD</ent> Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve 
either all or portions of the following.]</p>

<p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put 
out by a group in <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up 
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>

<p>Hi! Sherman Skolnick, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts 
[<ent type='ORG'>CCCC</ent>], 9800 South Oglesby.</p>

<p>A key [unclear] in various worldwide schemes is the <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>-based 
law firm, <ent type='GPE'>Hopkins</ent> &amp; <ent type='ORG'>Sutter</ent>.</p>

<p>The highly corrupt S&amp;L whitewash agency is the Resolution Trust 
Corporation (<ent type='ORG'>RTC</ent>). Guess where one of their main offices is? Why, 
inside the <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> offices of <ent type='GPE'>Hopkins</ent> &amp; <ent type='ORG'>Sutter</ent>.</p>

<p>A <ent type='GPE'>Hopkins</ent> [&amp; <ent type='ORG'>Sutter</ent>] partner is Jay Steinberg. He was bankruptcy 
trustee in the strange case of William Stecker(sp?) and 
Grayville(?) Corporation. *Hundreds* of millions of dollars 
disappeared. Steinberg doesn't seem to know *where*.</p>

<p>Also complicit with Steinberg is a member of the Justice 
Department's murder squad, Mike "Chucky" Peters, a <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> FBI 
agent with worldwide authority. In an undisputed, unpublicized 
federal case, Peters was accused of complicity in the murder of 
some *40* federal grand jury witnesses in the notorious Inslaw 
grand jury quiz.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>The Federal Deposit Insurance</ent> has a evil stepsister -- namely, 
<ent type='ORG'>RTC</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>Hopkins</ent> &amp; <ent type='ORG'>Sutter</ent>, *and* <ent type='ORG'>RTC</ent>, arranged to have the rotten 
Rose Law Firm of <ent type='GPE'>Little Rock</ent> used to cover up massive plundering 
of assets of failing or already defunct savings &amp; loans in the 
<ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> area -- such as in the western suburbs here. Backed up by 
a host of details, it seems <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> clandestine operatives 
*plundered* these S&amp;Ls -- including Olympic S&amp;L and Clyde 
Savings.</p>

<p>The Rose Law Firm partner, Hillary Rodham Clinton, played a role 
in *raping and plundering* one or more <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>-area S&amp;Ls!</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>Hopkins</ent> &amp; <ent type='ORG'>Sutter</ent>, and <ent type='ORG'>RTC</ent>-<ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>, arranged in recent years to 
transfer some $50 million from an <ent type='ORG'>RTC</ent> contingency fund to Little 
Rock -- to help cover up the $47 million of federally insured 
funds missing in <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent>.</p>

<p>A federal grand jury in <ent type='GPE'>Little Rock</ent> is considering criminal 
charges against the First Lady: massive bank embezzlement and 
income tax fraud.</p>

<p>The [<ent type='ORG'>RTC</ent>] funds were transferred from <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> reportedly with the 
help of Jay Steinberg *and* with attorney John Gearham(sp?), who 
is of the <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> suburb of <ent type='GPE'>Park Ridge</ent> -- same place Hillary is 
from. Gearham is "tight" with Hillary's lawyer brother.</p>

<p>With the reported connivance of <ent type='GPE'>Hopkins</ent> &amp; <ent type='ORG'>Sutter</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>RTC</ent> records 
are gone! Helping in the huge rip-off is <ent type='ORG'>Household International</ent> 
and their units, <ent type='ORG'>Household Bank</ent> -- an outgrowth of <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>'s Nugan- 
Hand Bank, once headquartered in Australia.</p>

<p>Interwoven in all this is the strange murder of <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> aide 
Vincent <ent type='ORG'>Foster</ent>, jr. Now, one of his secretaries has been a 
business partner of Dan Lassater -- tied to the savings &amp; loans 
through crooked bond dealings. After <ent type='ORG'>Foster</ent>'s death, she 
reportedly swiped some of his records; and they're being used by 
<ent type='GPE'>Hopkins</ent> &amp; <ent type='ORG'>Sutter</ent> and other lawyers, clandestine operatives, 
murder squad members, and crooked federal judges here to 
blackmail the Clinton <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>.</p>

<p>To "muddy the waters," they are spreading rumors... [laughs] 
possibly true [laughs]... that Hillary had her former lover and 
law partner, <ent type='ORG'>Foster</ent> -- now get this -- *murdered* by the Secret 
Service in the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>! Those who removed the body, however, 
planted it in a park in <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> to cast suspicion on the White 
House.</p>

<p>And what can you do? Well, call up your local news-fakers and 
tell them to stop kidding us about what the Clinton scandal is 
all about, huh?</p>

<p>In <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>, see us on cable tv, channel 21, 9 pm [cst] most
