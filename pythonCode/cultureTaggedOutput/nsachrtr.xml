****************************************************************
  At  12:01 ON the  morning of November 4,  1952, a new federal
agency was born.  Unlike other such bureaucratic births, however,
this one arrived in silence. No news coverage, no congressional
debate, no press announcement,  not even the whisper of  a rumor.
Nor could any  mention of  the new organization  be found in  the
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> Organization  Manual of  the Federal  Register or  the
Congressional Record. Equally invisible  were the new  agency's
director, its numerous buildings, and its ten thousand employees.</p>

<p>  Eleven days earlier,  on October 24, President Harry S Truman
scratched  his signature  on the  bottom of  a seven-page
presidential memorandum addressed  to secretary of <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>  Dean G.
Acheson  and Secretary of  <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> Robert A.  Lovett.  Classified
top  secret  and  stamped  with  a  code  word  that  was  itself
classified, the  order directed the establishment of an agency to
be  known as  the National  Security Agency.  It was  the birth
certificate  for  <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s  newest and  most  secret  agency, so
secret in  fact that only  a handful  in the government  would be
permitted to know of its existence.

<p>MEMORANDUM FOR:   The Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>
    The Secretary of defense</p>

<p>SUBJECT:  <ent type='ORG'>Communications Intelligence</ent> Activities</p>

<p>  The  communications intelligence  (<ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent>) activities  of the
United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s are  a national  responsibility.  They  must be  so
organized and managed as to exploit  to the maximum the available
resources in all  participating departments  and agencies and  to
satisfy  the legitimate  intelligence  requirements  of all  such
departments and agencies.
  I  therefore designate  <ent type='ORG'>the Secretaries</ent> of  <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>
as  a Special  <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>  of the  National  Security Council  for
<ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent>,  which  <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>  shall,  with  the  assistance  of  the
Director of  <ent type='ORG'>Central Intelligence</ent>,  establish policies  governing
<ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent>  activities. and keep me advised  of such policies through
the <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>the National Security Council</ent>.
  I  further designate  <ent type='ORG'>the Department</ent> of  <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> as executive
agent  of the  <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>, for  the production  of <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent>
information.
  I  direct  this  Special  <ent type='ORG'>Committee</ent>  to  prepare and  issue
directives which shall include the provisions set forth below and
such other provisions  as the <ent type='ORG'>Special Committee</ent>  may determine to
be necessary.</p>

directive shall include the following provisions:
a.  Subject to  the  specific provisions  of this
  directive, the Secretary of  <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent> may delegate in whole of
  in  part  authority  over the  Director  of  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>  within  his
  department as he sees fit.
b. The <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent>  mission of the National  Security Agency
  (<ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>) shall be to provide an effective,  unified organization
  and control of the communications  intelligence activities of
  the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s  conducted against foreign  governments, to
  provide for  integrated operational  policies and  procedures
  pertaining thereto. As  used in  this directive,  the terms
  "communications intelligence"  or "<ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent>" shall be construed
  to mean all  procedures and methods used in  the interception
  of communications  other  than foreign  press and  propaganda
  broadcasts  and  the  obtaining  of information  from  such
  communications by other  than intended recipients,  but shall
  exclude censorship  and the  production and dissemination  of
  finished intelligence.
c. <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent> shall be administered  by a Director, designated
  by  the  Secretary of  <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>  after  consultation with  the
  Joint Chiefs of Staff, who shall serve for a  minimum term of
  4  years and  who shall be  eligible for  reappointment.  The
  Director shall be a career commissioned officer of  the armed
  services  on active or reactivated status, and shall enjoy at
  least 3-star rank during the period of his incumbency.
d. Under the  Secretary of  <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>, and in  accordance
  with approved  policies of <ent type='ORG'>USCIB</ent>,  the Director of <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>  shall
  be responsible  for accomplishing  the mission  of <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>. For
  this purpose all  <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent> collection and production  resources
  of  the United <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>s  are placed  under his  operational and
  technical  control.  When  action  by  the  Chiefs  of  the
  operating  agencies of the  <ent type='ORG'>Services</ent> or  <ent type='ORG'>civilian department</ent>s
  or  agencies is  required, the Director  shall normally issue
  instruction  pertaining to  <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent> operations  through  them.
  However,  due  to the  unique technical  character  of <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent>
  operations,  the Director  is authorized  to issue  direct to
  any  operating elements  under  his operational  control task
  assignments and pertinent  instructions which are within  the
  capacity of such elements to accomplish.  He  shall also have
  direct access  to,  and direct  communication  with,  any
  elements  of the  <ent type='ORG'>Service</ent> or civilian  <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent> agencies on any
  other  matters of operational and technical control as may be
  necessary,  and he  is authorized to  obtain such information
  and intelligence material from  them as he may require. All
  instruction  issued  by  the  Director  under  the  authority
  provided in this paragraph  shall be mandatory, subject  only
  to  appeal  to  the Secretary  of  <ent type='ORG'>Defense</ent>  by the  Chief  of
  <ent type='ORG'>Service</ent> or head of <ent type='ORG'>civilian department</ent> of agency concerned.
e. Specific  responsibilities  of the  Director of  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>
  include the following:
   (1)  Formulating  necessary operational  plans and
policies for the conduct of the U.S. <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent> activities.
   (2) Conducting <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent> activities,  including
research and development, as required to meet the needs
of the  departments and agencies which  hare authorized
to receive the products of <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent>.
   (3)  Determining,  and  submitting to  appropriate
authorities, requirements for  logistic support for the
conduct of  <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent> activities,  together with  specific
recommendations  as  to  what each  of  the responsible
departments  and  agencies  of  the  <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>  should
supply.
   (4) Within  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>'s field  of authorized  operations
prescribing  requisite  security  regulations  covering
operating practices, including the  transmission,
handling and distribution of <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent> material within and
among  the <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent>  elements  under  his  operations  or
technical control; and  exercising the  necessary
monitoring and  supervisory control,  including
inspections if necessary, to ensure compliance with the
regulations.
   (5)  Subject to  the  authorities granted  the
Director  Central  Intelligence under  <ent type='ORG'>NSCID</ent>  No.  5,
conducting all liaison on  <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent> matters with  foreign
governmental communications intelligence agencies.
f. To  the extent he  deems feasible and  in consonance
  with  the aims  of maximum over-all  efficiency, economy, and
  effectiveness, the Director  shall centralize  or consolidate
  the  performance  of  <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent> functions  for  which  he is
  responsible.  It is recognized that in  certain circumstances
  elements of <ent type='ORG'>the Armed Forces</ent> and other  agencies being served
  will require close <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent> support.  Where necessary for  this
  close  support,  direct  operational  control  of specified
  <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent>  facilities  and resources  will be  delegated  by the
  Director,  during such  periods  and for  such tasks  as  are
  determined  by him,  to military commanders  or to the Chiefs
  of other agencies supported.
g.  The  Director  shall exercise  such  administrative
  control  over <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent> activities as he  deems necessary to the
  effective performance of his mission.  Otherwise,
  administrative  control  of  personnel  and  facilities  will
  remain with the departments and agencies providing them.
h.  The Director shall make provision for participation
  by  representatives of  each of the  departments and agencies
  eligible to receive <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent>  products in those offices of  <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>
  where  priorities  of  intercept and  processing  are finally
  planned.
i.  The  Director shall  have  a civilian  deputy whose
  primary responsibility  shall be  to ensure the  mobilization
  and  effective  employment of  the best  available  human and
  scientific  resources in the  field of cryptographic research
  and development.
j.  Nothing  in  this  directive  shall contravene  the
  responsibilities  of the  individual departments and agencies
  for  the  final evaluation  of <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent>  information, its
  synthesis  with  information  from  other  sources,  and  the
  dissemination of finished intelligence to users.
  3. The  special nature of  <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent> actives requires that  they
be treated  in all  respects as  being outside  the framework  of
other  or general  intelligence  activities. <ent type='ORG'>Order</ent>, directives,
policies, or recommendations  of any  authority of the  <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent>
Branch relating  to the  collection, production,  security,
handling, dissemination, or  utilization of intelligence,  and/or
classified material, shall  not be applicable to  <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent> actives,
unless  specifically so stated  and issued by competent
departmental of agency authority represented on <ent type='ORG'>the Board</ent>.  Other
<ent type='ORG'>National Security Council Intelligence Directive</ent> to the  Director
of  Central  Intelligence  and  related  implementing  directives
issued by the Director of <ent type='ORG'>Central Intelligence</ent> shall be construed
as  non-applicable  to  <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent>  activities, unless  the  National
Security Council has made  its directive specifically  applicable
to <ent type='ORG'>COMINT</ent>.</p>
