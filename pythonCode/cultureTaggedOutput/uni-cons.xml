 Unified Conspiracy Theory - Part 1</p>

<p>Except no substitutes, here is the Unified Field Theory of Conspiracies!</p>

<p>What can you say about a theory that:</p>

<p>  Is proposed by a member of the <ent type='ORG'>intel</ent>ligence community who claims to 
  have seen the documents.</p>

<p>  Claims that the Kennedy assassination was not because the military 
  industrial complex wanted to make money off <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>, but because he was 
  going to go public with government secrets about UFOs.</p>

<p>  Claims that secret treaties exist between our government and aliens from 
  space.</p>

<p>  Claims that much of our high tech stuff is obtained through this treaty.</p>

<p>  Claims that the treaty allows aliens to abduct people with government
  sanction.</p>

<p>  Gives project names of many secret projects associated with the UFO 
  coverup.</p>

<p>  Claims that the real Unified Field Theory is known and is being 
  suppressed.</p>

<p>  Says the aliens, in effect, claim to be God.</p>

<p>  Claims that secret UFO projects are partly funded by government drug
  smuggling.</p>

<p>What you can say is, if you want conspiracies, except no substitutes!  Set 
your weirdness bit way past the Twilight Zone, and read on!</p>

<p>WARNING LARGE POST FOLLOWS  ###############################################</p>

<p>  Fellow computer enthusiasts,    11-24-89</p>

<p>    What follows is a transcript of a 45 minute lecture that I at-
  tended on 11-17-89 at the "Whole Life Expo." in <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent>,
  <ent type='GPE'>California</ent>. Speaking was Mr. Milton William Cooper who I first
  became acquainted with through a text file I downloaded from a
  local computer BBS. The file dealt with the subject of UFO's and
  our government's concealment of the truth about them in such a
  way that it made a lasting impression on me, which is why I
  attended his lecture; to learn more. Please forgive my probable
  misspelling of some of the proper names in the transcript which
  follows and allow that I have taken it as best I could, word-
  for-word, from a less than acceptable micro-cassette recording.
    If you are as moved by what you are about to read as I was in
  hearing it first hand, I ask that you please spread it as far
  and wide as possible. Upload it to every BBS in your reach and
  please, don't change anything. Also, please give considerable
  thought to Mr. Cooper's suggestions as to what we all can do to
  see that this information is confirmed by our government to make
  them stop what they are up to.
   Thank you, and now, Milton Cooper:</p>

<p>    "For those of you who don't know who I am, I was raised in a
  military family. My family, my ancestors, since they came to
  this country, have been government people. We have served in the
  military, we have been patriots, we have fought in all the wars,
  we care about this country and believe in the constitution of
  <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent>. We know, as many people don't know, that the
  <ent type='GPE'>Constitu</ent>tion of <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent> of America IS the United
  States of America! And that's why we've always been ready ...to
  do the things needed ...to preserve and protect it."
    "When I left home I went into <ent type='ORG'>the Air Force</ent>, the Strategic Air
  Command. As a child I'd heard stories from my father and pilots,
  other pilots, my father was a pilot, about Foo Fighters, UFO's,
  strange craft that were not made on this <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent>. And as a kid,
  you hear that in passing, and it's neat, and you giggle about
  it, and you go out and play "Space Man", and you forget it."
    "When I was in <ent type='ORG'>the Air Force</ent> I met men who had participated in
  alien crashed-craft recoveries. Now this intrigued me, it in-
  terested me, but it was usually after quite a few bottles of
  beer that these stories would come out, and sometimes the next
  morning I couldn't remember what the heck the guy said."
    "When I left <ent type='ORG'>the Air Force</ent> I went into the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent>, and this is
  where everything began to happen for me. I had originally inten-
  ded to just go from service to service and do something that
  very few people have ever done before. I was a very adventurous,
  very crazy ...young man, and I thought that that would be a
  pretty exciting life. I volunteered for submarines, and while on
  the submarine U.S.S. Tyroot, <ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>-416, on a transit between the
  <ent type='GPE'>Portland</ent>/<ent type='GPE'><ent type='LOC'>Sea</ent>ttle</ent> area and Pearl Harbor, which was our home port;
  the Pearl Harbor sub base, as the port lookout I saw a craft,
  saucer-shaped, the size of a <ent type='ORG'>Midway</ent> class carrier, aircraft
  carrier, for those of you who don't know how big that is; it's
  huge, come up out of the water approximately 2 1/2 nautical
  miles off the port bow, which is about 45 degrees to the left of
  the pointy end of the submarine. It tumbled slowly on its own
  axis, and went up into the clouds. It appeared to be moving
  slowly to me at a distance of 2 1/2 nautical miles, but in
  reality it was moving pretty fast because it came up out of the
  water, did a few tumbles and it was gone!"
    "I then reported it to the officer of the deck. I didn't tell
  him what it was that I saw because my Daddy didn't raise no
  fools and in case nobody else saw it I didn't want to be the
  only looney onboard the ship. So I asked the officer of the deck
  to help me cover that area, and he did, which is common for of-
  ficers and lookouts to help each other while on bridge watch be-
  cause they all hang together if something bad happens. After a
  few seconds of watching, the same craft, or another craft exact-
  ly like it, came down out of the clouds, tumbled again on its
  own axis, and went into the water. Ensign Ball, who was the of-
  ficer of the deck, was literally shocked! What could I say? <ent type='LOC'>Sea</ent>-
  man Dejeralimo, who was the starboard lookout, had also witnes-
  sed this, and ensign Ball called the captain to the bridge who
  was followed by the chief quartermaster who brought a 35<ent type='ORG'>MM</ent> cam-
  era, and we watched for between 7 and 10 minutes the same craft,
  or different craft that looked exactly alike, enter and leave
  the water. It was an incredible show. I don't know if they knew
  we were there, or if they even cared, but the craft did not
  glow, they were metal, they were machines without a doubt, they
  were obviously <ent type='ORG'>intel</ent>ligently guided, they were HUGE, and having
  been in <ent type='ORG'>the Air Force</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> and knowing what it takes, I
  knew without a doubt, and know it today, that that machine was
  not made on the face of this <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent>. Because there's nothing that
  man can make, that can fly through the air at a speed like that,
  tumble on its own axis, and enter the water and effectively fly
  beneath the sea."
    "If you've ever been aboard an airplane and then gone aboard a
  submarine, I know there's probably some of you in this room who
  have visited a submarine at one time or another, you can readily
  see just without even any of the technicalities involved how
  difficult such a thing would be to do. Where would it be built,
  that size? It was absolutely incredible. It changed my life
  because then all the stories that I'd heard all my life I knew
  were true, and I began seeing the world in a different light."
    "It wasn't long after that I was trained by Naval security in
  <ent type='ORG'>intel</ent>ligence. I was sent to <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>. I was assigned as a patrol
  boat captain, first in <ent type='GPE'>DaNang</ent> harbor, given a crew, given a
  multi-million dollar patrol boat. My job was to gather <ent type='ORG'>intel</ent>-
  ligence from the people who lived around the harbor and the
  fishermen who transited the harbor, and maintain the safety and
  security of the harbor and the shipping. After about 5-months I
  was sent up <ent type='LOC'>North</ent> to the <ent type='LOC'>DMZ</ent>, to a place called Qua Vieaf [sp],
  on the <ent type='NORP'>Tacan</ent> [sp] river. Our base camp was at the river mouth.
  We were only 3-miles <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> of the <ent type='LOC'>North</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>ese border and
  our job was to patrol the <ent type='NORP'>Tacan</ent> river from the river mouth to
  Dang Ha [sp], and then up the Quang Tree [sp] cutoff to Quang
  Tree city, again to get to know the people on the bank, gather
  <ent type='ORG'>intel</ent>ligence, and to patrol every night and maintain the safety
  and security of the river and the river traffic."
    "It was while there that I discovered that there was a tremen-
  dous amount of UFO and alien activity in <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>. It was always
  reported in official messages as `enemy helicopters.' Now any of
  you who know anything about the <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent> war know that the <ent type='LOC'>North</ent>
  <ent type='GPE'>Vietnam</ent>ese did not have any helicopters, especially after our
  first couple of air raids into <ent type='LOC'>North</ent> <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>. Even if they had
  they would not have been so foolish as to bring them over the
  <ent type='LOC'>DMZ</ent> because that would have insured their demise. Our troops
  were fired on occasionally by these `enemy helicopters,' enemy
  troops were fired on occasionally by these `enemy helicopters,'
  and occasionally people would disappear. And on one instance
  that I know for sure at least one entire village disappeared one
  night due to alien activity. The reason they used the term
  `enemy helicopters' in messages and dispatches was that in Viet
  Nam you could be overrun at any time, no matter where you where.
  They did not bring crypto encoding equipment into <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>, I'm
  talking about the machinery. What we did is we had crypto tab-
  les, and once we every 24-hours those codes would be no good. So
  that's what we used. We also, because of the inability to use
  crypto transmitting equipment, had to devise code words such as
  `enemy helicopters.'"
    "When I left <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent> I was eventually attached to the head-
  quarters staff of the Commander in Chief of <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent>
  <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Fleet at Macalappa, [sp] <ent type='GPE'>Hawaii</ent>, which is a little hill
  overlooking Pearl Harbor, it's a beautiful white building up
  there, and I was specifically attached to the Intelligence
  Briefing Team of the Commander in Chief of <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent>
  <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Fleet."
    "It was during this tour of duty that, in the course of my
  duties, documents were placed in my hands that were so unbeliev-
  able and so incredible that it took me quite a while to adjust
  to the fact that what I was seeing was real. Now for those of
  you who don't understand how I could come to see this informa-
  tion let me give you a little short course in security clearance
  and "the need to know" and how you get to see classified infor-
  mation if you're in the military or in the government, it does-
  n't matter which, the rules are the same."
    "Number one you need a security clearance, and you've got to
  have clearance at the level that the information you want to see
  is classified at. In this instance it was classified `Top Sec-
  ret, Magic, Restricted Information,' which I came to find out
  later is the highest security classification in the Nation. To
  get that type of clearance, all you have to have is a Federal
  <ent type='ORG'>Bureau of Investigation</ent> background check, which takes about six
  months and they send federal agents to your home, to your old
  schools, to all your teachers, to your friends, to everybody you
  put down on your security clearance forms, to all your old ad-
  dresses, your neighbors, everybody that you've worked for, and
  it's embarrassing because they don't tell them what they're
  checking on. They just show them their identification and start
  asking questions and that's when you find out who's your friend
  and who's not, because a lot of people get scared and think,
  `Bill just robbed a bank and I'm not talkin' to him anymore.'"
    "Now once you get that it's called a `B.I.' and for those of
  you who have received a copy of my service record look on the
  first page, the DD-214 where it says `Security Clearance,' you
  will see the term `B.I.' That's a `<ent type='ORG'>Bureau of Investigation</ent>'
  clearance. Now at that point, you have the clearance for every-
  thing including Top Secret and above. What determines what you
  get to see is your need to know, and the job that you have de-
  termines what your need to know is."
    "I was assigned to the Intelligence Briefing Team of the Com-
  mander in Chief of <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent> <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Fleet, who had to
  know everything concerning his area of operations which was one-
  half of the <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent>'s surface; the <ent type='NORP'>Indian</ent> ocean, the <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent>
  ocean, and all the land masses in between. Believe it or not, if
  we go to war, if we ever go to war, it's <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent> <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent>
  that strikes the first blow and attempts to keep the enemy at
  bey while we can get ourselves together, at least historically.
  Nuclear weapons have kind of done away with that concept, but
  military commanders like to talk about it anyway."
    "Because of this, and you have no conception of the amount of
  material and information that an area commander has to know,
  it's unbelievable, and he has to keep track of this, he has to
  keep on top of it. He has to know what's happening, he has to
  make the right decisions. Because it's almost humanly impossible
  for anyone to do that, they have what's called a briefing team,
  and it's our job to make sure that he has the correct informa-
  tion, all the time, on a 24-hour basis. And every morning, be-
  tween 8 and 9 AM, we would give a briefing which covered every-
  thing that happened in the previous 24-hours, and everything
  scheduled to happen in the next 24-hours, and all the pertinent
  <ent type='ORG'>intel</ent>ligence reports that we had received since the last brief-
  ing that he needed to know and that his staff members needed to
  know. Occasionally we would get messages marked `Top Secret,
  Magic, Restricted Information,' and it would be coded in such a
  way that all you had were answers to questions which you didn't
  know what the questions were so you really didn't know what the
  message was all about."
    "But eventually I found myself in possession, holding two
  documents; one called `<ent type='ORG'>Project Grudge</ent>,' another one called `Op-
  eration Majority.' <ent type='ORG'>Project Grudge</ent> contained the history of alien
  involvement since around 1936, and it began talking about
  <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent>'s involvement with a crashed-disk that they had reco-
  vered in 1936 and were attempting to duplicate the technology.
  They were not successful despite what all these <ent type='NORP'>Nazi</ent> hunters
  want to tell you. If they had been successful, we would not have
  won the war, because you cannot beat those weapons! You cannot
  outfly those craft, you can't even think about it with conven-
  tional aircraft. If <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>German</ent>y</ent> had been successful, we would now
  have a <ent type='NORP'>German</ent> flag up in front of this podium."
    "They did make some headway. When we went into <ent type='LOC'>Punta Mundy</ent>
  [sp] we captured documents, we got some scientists, we got some
  hardware. The <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent>s</ent> also got some documents, some scientists,
  and some hardware. It wasn't until 1947 that we were able to
  capture a craft, a whole craft, not all together but it was
  everything. And that occurred near the city of <ent type='GPE'>Roswell</ent>, New
  <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>. There were dead aliens recovered from the craft. In Pro-
  ject Grudge I saw photographs of these dead aliens, of the
  craft, I saw photographs of live aliens, I saw photographs of
  autopsies, internal organs, I saw photographs of the alien des-
  ignated `E.B.'[or Ebe] which was held in captivity from 1949 un-
  til June the 2nd, 1952 when he died. I saw the history of what
  they had been able to at that time put together, from incidents
  in the 1800's which involved aliens and their craft."
    "I saw the names of projects. I saw a project that was to fly
  recovered alien craft that had been recovered intact and undam-
  aged, and some of them were recovered intact and undamaged, and
  how that happened I have no idea. It was called `Project Red-
  light,' and first was conducted from the <ent type='ORG'>Tonopah</ent> test range in
  the <ent type='GPE'>Nevada</ent> test sight and then was moved to a specially built
  area, ordered built by president Eisenhower, called `Area-51,'
  code named `Dreamland,' in the Groom [sp] dry lake area of the
  <ent type='GPE'>Nevada</ent> test sight, by secret executive order. It doesn't exist
  officially, if you ask anyone, or if you write letters to the
  government they will tell you it doesn't exist. However if you
  go out there at several places and see it, fly outside the
  boundaries and look down and see it, you know it's there, but
  according to the government it doesn't exist."
    "The project to fly, test fly these craft, was ongoing until
  sometime in 1962 when a craft blew up not far from the test
  sight, in the air, and the explosion was seen over a three-state
  area. The pilots were killed, they had no idea what had happened
  or why the craft blew up, but they put Project Redlight on hold
  until a later date when the aliens supplied us with 3-craft and
  personnel to help us learn how to fly these craft. That project
  is ongoing and we now have not only alien craft that we are fly-
  ing, we have craft we have built, using the captured technology,
  and some of the UFO's that people report seeing in the United
  States, and maybe even elsewhere, are flown by <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent>
  personnel."
    "That may come as a shock to you. We have technology way be-
  yond the limits of what we have been told. A lot of our develop-
  ment technologically, since the end of World War II, has been
  due to the exchange of technology which occurs in the area
  called `Area-51' on a regular basis ...ongoing."
    "When James Oberth, professor Oberth retired, many of you
  don't know who he is ...not too many space people in here. Pro-
  fessor Oberth was probably one of the greatest rocket scientists
  and space commentists that ever lived. When he retired, the gov-
  ernment gave him a special award, there was a press conference,
  all kinds of ceremony, and when he got up to speak he said,
  `Gentlemen,' and I quote professor Oberth, he said, `Gentlemen,
  we cannot take credit for all the technological developments
  that we have had in the last decade. We have had help,' and
  that's where he stopped."
    "One of the reporters raised his hand and said, `Professor
  Oberth, can you tell us what other country helped us?'"
    "He said, `It was those little guys from out in space,' and
  then he got down and and would not comment any further. Now this
  occurred in 1959. I can go on and on but time doesn't allow it."
    "I will tell you ladies and gentlemen that there are all kinds
  of things going on all the time, we are making rapid progress in
  exposing this. Since I have begun talking, people have been com-
  ing out of the woodwork at a rapid rate, who know and have
  pieces of this puzzle, and are helping us to put it together,
  because I don't have all the answers. I saw an awful lot of ma-
  terial, I have remembered an awful lot of it, I have probably,
  in my remembering, made some mistakes, and I guarantee you
  they're minor ones, if I have."
    "We have just recently, for those of you who didn't believe
  that <ent type='ORG'>the Jason Society</ent> of the Jason Scholars, the secret group
  existed, we now have a letter from the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent>, with 51 names
  of the Jason Scholars, an admission from the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> that they
  hold the highest security clearances in the nation, an admission
  from the <ent type='ORG'>Pentagon</ent> that they hold the protocol rank of Rear Ad-
  miral, and are treated as such on any military installation or
  in any government office. There are 6 Nobel Prize winners on
  that list, there are the elite of the elite of the scientific
  world, they are the only ones who really know the truth about
  the technology today and about the real sc<ent type='GPE'>ience</ent> of physics, be-
  cause the one that we're being taught all the time... If you
  send your kids to college to learn physics you're wasting your
  money because they're teaching them stuff that doesn't work,
  it's not true, it's not real. Gravity is not what we think it
  is. There IS a Unified Theory! We already know what it is, it's
  what makes these craft work. It's absolutely incredible what's
  going on."
    "How many of you keep up with <ent type='ORG'>Billy Goodman</ent>'s show on <ent type='ORG'>KVEG</ent> out
  of <ent type='GPE'>Las Vegas</ent>? For those of you who don't, I would try tuning in
  on any night between 10:00 PM and 1:00 AM. It's 840 on your AM
  dial, and the subject every night are those subjects that no
  other media person in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent> will touch with a 10-
  foot pole, every single night except Saturday night. It's the
  only show that you can call in and talk to another caller,
  you've got 3-minutes to say whatever you want to say as long as
  you don't cuss or swear or slander anyone, and every night
  they're helping to expose this."
    "When John Lear and I first said what was going on out at
  <ent type='LOC'>Groom Lake</ent> everybody said, `You're nuts, there's nothing going
  on out at <ent type='LOC'>Groom Lake</ent>!' The listeners of the <ent type='ORG'>Billy Goodman</ent> radio
  show put together an excursion and went up to <ent type='LOC'>Groom Lake</ent> and
  they all, ever since, every night, they go up there and watch
  them test fly the alien craft ...every night! The first night
  they had 100 people there. And 100 people saw 4 alien craft fly,
  doing things that no airplane and no helicopter can do. Now they
  don't tell us anymore that there's nothing happening at Groom
  Lake. What they tell us now is there's no such thing as aliens,
  it's all government secret projects. That's okay because we'll
  prove that wrong too eventually, it just takes awhile. Because
  where we WERE ...it's not where we're AT, and I'm really happy
  about that."
    "Now, if you want to see what's happening right now, keep
  watching your movies, keep watching your television commercials,
  your alien programs on television, read Whitley Streeper's
  `Majestic' which is a part of the contingency plan called `Ma-
  jestic' to test the reaction of the population to the presence
  of aliens on the <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent>. And I have just finished my study of
  Whitley Streeper's book `Majestic,' and I'm gonna tell you right
  now that most of the documents in there, that he says are fic-
  tion, are real documents that came right out of <ent type='ORG'>Project Grudge</ent>.
  It is part of the government's campaign to leak information out
  in ways that they can always deny that it's real. There's only
  one thing wrong with the information in that book, the stories
  of the characters in there I know nothing about. What I'm talk-
  ing about are the supposed government documents that he has in
  that book. I'm telling you tonight they're real. Those are some
  of the same documents that I saw in <ent type='ORG'>Project Grudge</ent> back between
  1970 &amp; 1973, and where we have wondered before, now we know that
  Whitley Streeper IS working for the government. And we had a
  suspicion anyway because in the front of his book he states that
  he got information and was helped by the research team of Moore,
  Shanderey, and Friedman. William Moore has publicly admitted on
  July the 1st that he is an agent of <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent> Govern-
  ment, and we know that the others are too."
    "This is gonna come out, and the reason they're doing it the
  way they're doing it is they know eventually you're gonna find
  out that it's all true and real. They're desensitizing you so
  that you're not shocked, so that there's no collapse of society
  as we know it, so that the religious structure doesn't fall to
  pieces, so that the stock market doesn't go crazy, because these
  were their original fears. Now, there's nothing we can do about
  the last one because it's already happened, there will be a seg-
  ment of the population that worships the aliens, even though
  they're no different than us they're just from somewhere else,
  and they may look a little different. They are not gods. But
  there are already people worshiping the aliens and they predic-
  ted this would happen when they slapped the secret stamp all
  over all this stuff."
    "You know, there's really nothing wrong with what's been hap-
  pening except for 3 things;" [Cooper forgot to mention the 3rd
  thing, or was sidetracked, or included it into the 2nd thing.]
    Number one, when they decided to keep it secret they needed to
  finance it, they couldn't tell the public so they couldn't tell
  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>. They decided to finance it with the sale, importation
  and sale, of drugs. Now in the documents that I read, in Opera-
  tion Majority, it specifically stated that when George Bush was
  the president and CEO of <ent type='ORG'>Sapata</ent> [sp] Oil, he, in conjunction
  with the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, organized the first large scale drug importation
  into this country from <ent type='LOC'>South</ent> and <ent type='LOC'>Central America</ent> by fishing
  boat, to the offshore oil platforms of <ent type='ORG'>Sapata</ent> Oil, and then from
  there into the beach, thus bypassing all <ent type='ORG'>Customs</ent> inspections and
  law enforcement inspections of any kind. They are still bringing
  in drugs, to a limited extent, in this manner. Another manner is
  by <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> contract aircraft which, one of their bases of landing is
  <ent type='GPE'>Homestead</ent> [sp] Air Force Base in <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>. We have affidavits
  from air controllers who have vectored the planes in, who have
  made sure that they're not interfered with in any way. We have
  affidavits from personnel at <ent type='GPE'>Homestead</ent> Air Force Base who say
  the planes have been met by Zeb Bush, who's George Bush's son.
  We have affidavits from people who work in <ent type='LOC'>the Gulf of <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent></ent>,
  in the offshore oil business, that yes indeed, the drugs are
  coming in, at least some of them, from the offshore oil plat-
  forms."
    From the aud<ent type='GPE'>ience</ent> came a clear statement, "Just say no?"
    "Pardon? ...Right! Just Say No! Well that's what we're gonna
  do ladies and gentlemen with your help ...we are going to say
  NO, no more! And you gotta do it, you gotta act. You either
  gotta act, or watch your country go down the tubes."
    "Now, that's one of the things that's wrong. The next thing
  that's wrong is, to keep the secret, they killed a lot of people
  who tried to leak it out. And if I hadn't done it the way that I
  did it, you wouldn't be seeing me anywhere standing or walking
  on this <ent type='LOC'>Earth</ent> now. They killed president Kennedy and during the
  workshop, for those of you haven't seen the tape, I will show
  you, on the tape, who shot the president and why. Between '70
  and '73, in <ent type='ORG'>Operation</ent> Majority it stated verbatim that President
  Kennedy ordered <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12 to cease the importation and sale of drugs
  to the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> people, that he ordered them to implement a plan
  to reveal the presence of aliens to the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> people within
  the following year. His assassination was ordered by the policy
  committee of the Vilderbergers. <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12 implemented the plan and
  carried it out in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent>. It involved agents of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, Divis-
  ion-5 of the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>, the <ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent>, and the office of Naval
  Intelligence. President Kennedy was killed by the driver of his
  car, his name was William Greer, he used a recoilless, electric-
  ally operated, gas-powered assassination pistol that was spe-
  cially built by the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> to assassinate people at close range. It
  fired an explosive pellet which injected a large amount of
  shellfish poison into the brain, and that is why, in the docu-
  ments, it stated that President Kennedy's brain was removed. If
  you've studied the case, you will find that indeed his brain
  disappeared. The reason for that is so that they would not find
  the particles of the exploding pellet or the shellfish poison in
  his brain which would have proved conclusively that Lee Harvy
  Oswald was NOT the assassin. In fact, Lee Harvy Oswald never
  fired a shot, he was the patsy."
    Mr. Cooper paused briefly, and a lady in the aud<ent type='GPE'>ience</ent> asked
  the obvious question, "Why haven't YOU been assassinated?"
    "If they were to kill me right now, what would you think?"
  Cooper posed.
    "That it's the truth," several people chimed.
    "I've got `em right where I want `em. If they touch me,
  everyone who's ever heard me talk is gonna be absolutely enraged
  and is gonna know that everything I've said is true. As long as
  they don't touch me there's gonna be some of you who are always
  gonna be wondering. But eventually we're gonna bring enough
  proof out, and if you're here during the workshop you're gonna
  see an awful lot of it that's gonna prove to you that it's true.
  It's real. And it's happening!"
    "Okay, I've tried to cover a lot of stuff, just briefly, be-
  cause there's no time in 45 minutes to get into anything very
  much."
    Mr. Cooper then announced the scheduled workshop session the
  following day in which tangible proofs could be seen but regret-
  tably I was unable to attend. He then opened up the floor to
  questions and answers.
    A muffled question was barely heard coming from the front of
  the room which in essence asked, "What about all the people in
  the press and others who were in <ent type='GPE'>Dallas</ent> and who saw the assass-
  ination? Couldn't they tell where the shot came from, why didn't
  they come forward? There must have been plenty."
    "There was, we know that there was at least 18 who were all
  murdered within 2-years of the event. The odds of that happening
  are 1 in 300000 trillion," Cooper replied.
    Again a muffled question, "Why did the DRIVER have to shoot
  Kennedy?"
    "Because the other fools missed! There were a total of 3-shots
  fired at President Kennedy, one hit him in the throat and didn't
  kill him and 2 of them hit John Connelly [sp]. The one that was
  fired from the grassy knoll hit the president in the throat. The
  other 2-shots came from directly behind the limousine, not the
  school book depository building, and hit Governor Connelly. Gov-
  ernor Connelly, in <ent type='ORG'>intel</ent>ligence community circles, is known as a
  `can do' man, because he took 2-hits and still kept his mouth
  shut."
    "How is it that the driver, sitting on the front, left-hand
  side of the car was able to blow off the right side of Kennedy's
  brain when the bullet actually entered in, and it would have
  been virtually impossible..." another person asked.
    Mr. Cooper seized the gist of his question and injected, "For
  those of you who have been listening to all these talk show
  hosts, whose job it is to be a talk show host, and who have not
  done any legitimate research into this, if you come to the work-
  shop, I will show you, on the tape, how it was done. You will
  see that Kennedy was, in fact slumped over against Jackie, his
  head was turned [this direction], it was very simple, it was
  easy and you will see it with your own eyes."
    Another muffled, off-mike question from a member of the audi-
  ence inquiring why no one else had come forward with the infor-
  mation Mr. Cooper was disseminating, and why those who knew it
  had kept it secret for so long was quickly answered, "It hasn't
  been, I'm talkin' about it now. Bill English was talkin' about
  it 8-years ago but everybody laughed at Bill English. John
  Lear's been talkin' about it for 3-years and everybody laughed
  at him. Now there's so many people have been talkin' about it,
  people are startin' to listen and it's about time. Because it's
  about time we that we quit being fools, and that's exactly what
  they think we are and we prove it to them every day."
    Almost all of the questions from the aud<ent type='GPE'>ience</ent> were to faint to
  hear. The next one dealt with the alien technology and asked in
  essence, "Hasn't any one else [other than the government] come
  up with the energy technology that the aliens have?" to which
  Mr. Cooper answered, "There's been quite a few people who've
  come up with it and they've ALL been stopped, and they'll all
  continue to be stopped. Because once you have it you have FREE
  ENERGY. Once you have free energy they no longer have power over
  you. You understand? That's why they stop it."
    Another question asking, "In the film of the assassination
  which was examined greatly by experts, why didn't THEY conclude
  that Kennedy's driver shot him?", to which Cooper asked, "Exam-
  ined by <ent type='ORG'>WHO</ent> greatly?", and continued, "Most of the film that you
  can purchase has that segment cut out, and you can always tell
  it by the person running in the background, they'll run up to
  here... all of a sudden they'll be down here... running. You
  will see in most of the clips that you've ever seen on televi-
  sion, or in the movies, or that you're able to get your hands
  on, you'll see William Greer start to turn like this...", then a
  muffled comment from the aud<ent type='GPE'>ience</ent>, then Cooper answered, "That's
  because they clipped it out! And on a lot of them, I'll bet you
  most of you, every time you've seen the clip on television,
  never looked at the driver anyway. If you're really honest with
  yourself, and with me, you know your eyes were right on
  Kennedy."
    A woman asked if any of the alien technology was being used in
  present-day military equipment and was answered, "Yes, there's a
  lot of alien technology contained in the Stealth bomber, that's
  right. The Stealth fighter was flying for 10-years before you
  even knew it existed."
    As the hour drew late another question, more clearly stated,
  was asked of Mr. Cooper by a woman closer to my ears, "Before
  you let us all out of here, there's a bunch of us here wondering
  what can we all do to help bring this all out?"
    A single word, "REVOLT" issued from several listeners simul-
  taneously but Cooper responded, "Don't revolt. What you need to
  do is what you should have been doing all along. You need to get
  involved with your government. The first thing you need to do is
  purchase a copy of the <ent type='GPE'>Constitu</ent>tion, which I know that most of
  you don't have anywhere in your house, and if I were to go
  around this room and ask each person what the <ent type='GPE'>Constitu</ent>tion says,
  most of you couldn't tell me what the <ent type='GPE'>Constitu</ent>tion says from
  your grocery bill. And that's the truth! And that IS your coun-
  try! So if you don't know what your <ent type='GPE'>Constitu</ent>tion is you're dead
  already, so the first thing you do is you get a copy of your
  <ent type='GPE'>Constitu</ent>tion. The second thing you do is you learn it! The third
  thing you do is you start calling your senators and your repre-
  sentatives, and the President of <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent> and you start
  leaning on them, and you tell them, `Unless you straighten up
  the government, and unless we start getting the truth, and I
  mean the whole truth, and no more of this baloney, this's the
  last job you're ever gonna have, period. And I'll do everything
  in my power to make sure that comes true.' And then write them,
  frequently, saying the same thing. And then when they're in your
  area, in their area offices, take a little delegation and go see
  them, and make them understand that they're gonna be living in
  poverty because they're not gonna have a job anymore come elec-
  tion day. You see, the secret government may own the executive
  branch, but you people, all of us, we own the <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, and the
  <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> makes the laws, and the <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> can impeach the entire
  executive branch! You also have the right to petition the gov-
  ernment for a redress of injuries. So you ARE powerful, you've
  just forgotten that you're powerful, you've forgotten that that
  vote that you haven't been doing every time election comes
  around, that vote has abdicated your power. That vote you did
  not cast abdicated your power and gave it to those who are
  subverting the <ent type='GPE'>Constitu</ent>tion and are ruining this country."
    A gentleman then asked, "What was traded to the aliens for
  their technology?"
    "People and animals," replied Cooper succinctly.
    Another man asked, "Is <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union</ent> in on any of this?"
    "<ent type='GPE'>The <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent> of America have been
  close allies since the end of World War II and have been closely
  participating in the secret space program all this time. The
  <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>s</ent> have the same thing we have, yes. What you see happening
  in the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> block right now is not the result of people stand-
  ing up and saying, `We want to be free.' It's the result of the
  international bankers saying, `You tear down these barriers, and
  you meet the <ent type='LOC'>West</ent> half way, give your people some freedom, the
  <ent type='LOC'>West</ent> is gonna take some freedom away from their people so that
  we can put together a one-world economic system ...and have all
  the power. That's what's happening! If you don't believe it,
  stick around and watch it!"
    A dubious woman then asked, "Why was the shellfish poison
  necessary? A lot of his brain was blown off anyway."
    Cooper: "The shellfish poison? If you go to kill someone, one
  thing I've learned, I learned it real good, I learned it espe-
  cially good when I went to <ent type='GPE'>Viet Nam</ent>; just `cause you shoot some-
  one doesn't mean they're gonna die. And if they don't die,
  they're gonna be <ent type='ORG'>MAD</ent>. And if they've got a gun, you're dead. So
  you want the first time to be the last time. So if you really
  want to to kill somebody you don't play around. If you REALLY
  want to kill somebody ...you KILL them, you don't play, you make
  sure that when you shoot them, they're dead. That way they can't
  hurt you, can't hurt you at all."
    Regrettably, the next question was totally un<ent type='ORG'>intel</ent>ligible, I
  was thankful however that Mr. Cooper had a good public address
  system to amplify his reply, "The first moon landing was May the
  22nd, 1962... or excuse me, that was the first landing on <ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent>.
  I'm sorry, May the 22nd, 1962 was the winged probe that used a
  hydrozine propeller, flew around approximately 3-orbits and lan-
  ded on May the 22nd, 1962, was a joint <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent> / <ent type='NORP'>Russian</ent>
  endeavor. The first time that we landed on the moon was sometime
  during the ...probably middle 50's, because at the time when
  President Kennedy stated that he wanted a man to set foot on the
  moon by the end of the decade we already had a base there."
    "What about <ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent>?" came another quick question.
    "We have a base on <ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent> also," Cooper calmly replied.
    "When did that happen?"
    "I don't know the exact date but I know the project's name, it
  was `Adam and Eve'."
    "How long have you known about this?"
    "Well, I revealed it publicly for the first time on July the
  2nd, 1989, and within 3-weeks of the time I revealed it public-
  ly, the government, to get the <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> people not to listen to
  me, came out and said that they planned to build a base on the
  moon and a colony on <ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent>. Now, 3-days previous to my speech,
  representatives from <ent type='ORG'>NASA</ent> said, `We can never have a colony on
  <ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent>, it's impossible that there's a colony on <ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent> because <ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent>
  is a dead planet.' And it's NOT a dead planet, they've lied to
  you about <ent type='LOC'>Mars</ent>."
    "My name is Dave [un<ent type='ORG'>intel</ent>ligible], I'm a representative of the
  <ent type='ORG'>Crystic</ent> Institute, and I'd like to know why it was that when we
  sent a representative down to your home, at your request, you
  failed to produce any documentation to <ent type='ORG'>substanti</ent>ate your allega-
  tions."
    "In the first place it was NOT at my request, I have never
  contacted <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Crystic</ent> Institute</ent> in my life. I was on the Carol
  Hemingway Show, she contacted the <ent type='ORG'>Crystic</ent> institute, she told
  Daniel Shehan [sp] that I had just said something about Bush and
  drugs on her show. HE called ME and told me he wanted to send an
  investigator, in fact he told me to even help the investigator
  because he was new at the job, his name was Wayne Nelson, he is
  a very good gentleman, he stayed at my house for 2-days, slept
  overnight on my couch, I gave him everything I had. I never told
  Daniel Shehan that I had any documents and I never told Wayne
  Nelson that I had any documents. In fact what I told Wayne Nel-
  son, and I quote, `Wayne, if I did have the documents I couldn't
  admit it and I don't know you from Adam, and I don't know Daniel
  Shehan from Adam and what makes you think I would give them to
  you.' Who am I going to give them to and how quick are they go-
  ing to disappear, that was my thought. Wayne Nelson also came to
  my house with a stack of documents this thick already <ent type='ORG'>substanti</ent>-
  ating the presence of aliens and extraterrestrial craft on this
  planet, and they are keeping it a secret, because they're afraid
  somebody'll laugh at them and they'll loose their credibility."
    "We need some patriots in this country, not people trying to
  make a name for themselves, trying to expose some drug runners,
  because those are just the bag-men. The real crook is in the
  <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>! And you can tell THAT to Daniel Shehan!"
    "Why didn't Jackie Kennedy report [the source of the lethal
  shot]?" asked another aud<ent type='GPE'>ience</ent> member.
    "Who's she gonna tell? The <ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent> just killed her hus-
  band and they're assigned to protect the President. Also, who
  had her children? The same <ent type='ORG'>Secret Service</ent> had her children at
  the time."
    "Wasn't the craft at <ent type='GPE'>Roswell</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>New <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent></ent> destroyed and all the
  aliens killed?" another young man asked.
    "All the aliens were dead but the craft was not completely
  destroyed, it was severely damaged yes."
    On an unrelated note an older gentleman asked, "Does that mean
  that `Alternative-3' is true?"
    "Alternative-3 is absolutely true and so is `Alternative-2'."
    Then a man in his late 20's or early 30's raised his hand,
  said something I couldn't hear, and was apparently recognized by
  Mr. Cooper who asked him to take the podium and address the aud-
  <ent type='GPE'>ience</ent>.
    "What I said was that I thanked him [Cooper] very much for
  coming forward and saying something. A lot of my friends out
  here know that I was involved in <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent> Special For-
  ces, UFO Tracking and Research from the years 1971 to 1975. My
  name is Richard Murray, I was based out of the 71st Tac Controll
  Flight, McDill Air Force Base, <ent type='GPE'>Tampa</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Florida</ent>. We were `Mobile
  Radar Command,' that was combat and war ready. We could be load-
  ed on aircraft within an hour and many times were taken into
  areas [to] set up radar. A lot of times we were set up around
  <ent type='ORG'>Egland</ent> [sp] Air Force Base because that's where they have the
  `Altered Temperature Weather Control', where they can test vari-
  ous aircraft for their shrinkage and their dimension change dur-
  ing altered temperature. So, you know, I was told to shut up
  twice in 1982 and they finally threatened my parents life so I
  stayed quiet, and, that's when Wendel Stevens was taken off the
  streets... Just like that! And I hid for quite awhile, and deci-
  ded to come back out when I heard that you're [Cooper] of such
  high rank as you were, and I felt just in saying that your cre-
  dentials are true, and that what you have to say, everything
  you've said here today, I've heard before behind closed doors.
  And you've really tied the link for me to the Kennedy killing.
  And there's a few more links that have to go on with the Colum-
  bia <ent type='ORG'>Cartel</ent> and the money laundering. I think there's more than
  one cartel involved, and they're shutting one of them down so
  one can maintain a power, it just seems to be the way it works."
    A muffled question then came from someone in the aud<ent type='GPE'>ience</ent>
  regarding the person referred to as "Colonel Stevens."
    "Uh, Colonel Stevens is out of jail now," replied Murray who
  was quickly asked another question I couldn't hear to which he
  answered, "I sure hope to hell so, he is a wonderful man and I
  give him my utmost respect and it was one of the saddest days in
  my life to see what happened to him happen to him. But I don't
  care what they say about Wendel Stevens, in my heart you can't
  discredit that man to me. I don't care who the hell you are. I
  won't listen to it, I don't give a shit if he was screwin' ba-
  bies. You know... that doesn't... he's not that kind of a man, I
  don't care what you say, I know him personally."</p>

<p>    The lecture was then essentially over. The "Alternative-2 and
  -3" that were referred to briefly are, to the best of my know-
  ledge, two government contingency plans and I don't know which
  is which, to 1: Declare Martial Law and invalidate the <ent type='GPE'>Constitu</ent>-
  tion on the premise that a terrorist group had entered the coun-
  try with a Nuclear weapon with plans to detonate it in a major
  city. All dissidents would be rounded up and placed in concen-
  tration camps and the press and media would be nationalized. All
  this, if the information becomes public before they want it to
  or if the aliens attempt a takeover, and 2: Another contingency
  plan to contain or delay the release of this information, the
  details of which I am probably wrong about anyway.
    My own personal reaction to Milton William Cooper; Mr. Cooper
  is a man who appears to be in his late fourties, of medium
  height and weight, and was dressed casually when I saw him. His
  hairline was receding slightly and he carried himself with con-
  fidence and purpose. Bill Cooper, as he was called by several in
  attendance, is not a professional speaker. His presentation
  lacked the polish of repeated deliveries which all the other
  lectures I heard during the Expo. had, but what it lacked in
  fine tuning was easily made up for in its content. Weather or
  not everyone in the aud<ent type='GPE'>ience</ent> was convinced of his sincerity I do
  not know, but the thunderous peal of applause which exploded as
  he concluded the session spoke for me and the majority of those
  in attendance. I am convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that
  Bill Cooper believes everything he said, and I'm about as
  skeptical as they come.
    Please read the attached file written by Milton William Cooper
  which describes some of the government operations, projects, and
  code names that pertain to the above transcript. Perhaps from
  the two documents you can reach your own conclusions as to what
  "Alternative-2 and -3 are.</p>

<p>  The following is the original file "OPER-MAJ.TXT" which

    This file contains the absolute true information regarding the
  alien presence on earth and <ent type='ORG'>the US Government</ent>'s involvement with
  the aliens.  This file contains only the information as I saw it
  and only my information.  It does not contain any information
  from any other source.
    It was necessary for me to issue the information previous to
  this release in a manner which would deceive the Government
  until someone was able to independently confirm my identity, my
  employment, my service record, my <ent type='ORG'>intel</ent>ligence background, the
  identity of the person to which I gave the information in 1972,
  his acknowledgment of the information and when it was given to
  him, that the information is correct, that I have not seen him
  since 1974, and that I have not communicated with him in any
  form since 1976.  This was necessary because this file is my
  death warrant if <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12 continues to operate in a manner
  consistent with its history.
    All in the last paragraph has been independently verified by 2
  different people who have no connection with each other. I will
  only list one for obvious reasons.

  choosing in order to confirm this information.  I will not,
  however submit to any test or hypnosis by anyone who is now or
  has ever been connected with the Government in any capacity for
  obvious reasons.
    The following is brief listing of everything that I personally
  saw and know from 1972 and does not contain any input from any
  other source whatsoever.</p>

<p>    <ent type='ORG'>MAJESTY</ent> was listed as the code word for the President of the
  <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent> for communications concerning this information.
    OPERATION MAJORITY is the name of the operation responsible
  for every aspect, project, and consequence of alien presence on
  earth.
    GRUDGE Contains 16 volumes of documented information collected
  from the beginning of <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent> investigation of
  Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's) and Identified Alien Crafts
  (<ent type='ORG'>IAC</ent>).  The project was funded by <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> confidential funds (non-
  appropriated) and money from the illicit drug trade.
  Participation in the illegal drug trade was justified in that it
  would identify and eliminate the weak elements of our society.
  The purpose of project GRUDGE was to collect all scientific,
  technological, medical and <ent type='ORG'>intel</ent>ligence information from UFO/<ent type='ORG'>IAC</ent>
  sightings and contacts with alien life forms.  This orderly file
  of collected information has been used to advance the United
  States Space Program.
    <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12 is the name of <ent type='ORG'>the secret control group</ent>.  President
  Eisenhower commissioned a secret society known as THE <ent type='ORG'>JASON</ent>
  SOCIETY (<ent type='ORG'>JASON</ent> SCHOLARS) to sift through all the facts,
  evidence, technology, lies and deception and find the truth of
  the alien question.  The society was made up of 32 of the most
  prominent men in the country in 1972 and the top 12 members were
  designated <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12.  <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12 has total control over everything.
  They are designated by the codes J-1, J-2, etc all the way
  through the members of <ent type='ORG'>the Jason Society</ent>.
    The director of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> was appointed J-1 and is the Director
  of <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12.  <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12 is responsible only to the President.  <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12
  runs most of the world's illegal drug trade.  This was done to
  hide funding and thus keep the secret from the <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and the
  people of <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent>.  It was justified in that it would
  identify and eliminate the weak elements of our society.  The
  cost of funding the alien connected projects is higher than
  anything you can imagine.  <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12 assassinated President Kennedy
  when he informed them that he was going to tell the public all
  the facts of the alien presence.  He was killed by the Secret
  Service agent driving his car and it is plainly visible in the
  film held from public view.
    A secret meeting place was constructed for <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12 in <ent type='GPE'>MARYLAND</ent>
  and it was described as only accessible by air.  It contains
  full living, recreational, and other facilities for <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12 and
  the <ent type='ORG'>JASON</ent> SOCIETY.  It is code named "THE COUNTRY CLUB". Only
  those with TOP SECRET/MAJIC clearance are allowed to go there.
    MAJI is the MAJORITY AGENCY FOR JOINT INTELLIGENCE.  All
  information, disinformation, and <ent type='ORG'>intel</ent>ligence is gathered and
  evaluated by this agency.  This agency is responsible for all
  disinformation and operates in conjunction with the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>,
  and <ent type='ORG'>the Defense Intelligence Agency</ent>.  This is a very powerful
  organization and all alien projects are under its control.  MAJI
  is responsible only to <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12.
    SIGMA is the project which first established communications
  with the aliens and is still responsible for communications.
    <ent type='ORG'>PLATO</ent> is the project responsible for <ent type='ORG'>Diplomatic</ent> relations with
  the aliens.  This project secured a formal treaty (illegal under
  the <ent type='GPE'>Constitu</ent>tion) with the aliens.  The terms were that the
  aliens would give us technology.  In return we agreed to keep
  their presence on earth a secret, not to interfere in any way
  with their actions, and to allow them to abduct humans and
  animals.  The aliens agreed to furnish <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12 with a list of
  abductees on a periodic basis.
    MAJIC is the security classification and clearance of all
  alien connected material, projects, and information.  MAJIC
  means MAJI Controlled.
    <ent type='ORG'>AQUARIUS</ent> is a project which compiled the history of alien
  presence and their interaction with Homo <ent type='ORG'>Sapiens</ent> upon this
  planet for the last 25000 years and culminating with the <ent type='NORP'>Basque</ent>
  people who live in the mountainous country on the border of
  <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Spain</ent> and the <ent type='NORP'>Syrians</ent>.
    <ent type='ORG'>GARNET</ent> is the project responsible for control of all
  information and documents regarding this subject and
  accountability of the information and documents.
    <ent type='ORG'>PLUTO</ent> is a project to evaluate all UFO/ <ent type='ORG'>IAC</ent> information
  pertaining to space telZk{k+9kR [TRANSMI<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>ION GARBLED]
    POUNCE is the project formed to recover all downed/ crashed
  craft and aliens.
    REDLIGHT is the project to test fly recovered alien craft.  It
  is conducted at AREA 51 (<ent type='ORG'>DREAMLAND</ent>) in <ent type='GPE'>Nevada</ent>.  It was aided
  when the aliens gave us craft and helped us fly them.  The
  initial project was somewhat successful in that we flew a
  recovered craft but it blew up in the air and the pilots were
  killed.  The project was suspended at that time until the aliens
  agreed to help us.
    <ent type='ORG'>SNOWBIRD</ent> was established as a cover for project REDLIGHT.
  Several flying saucer type craft were built using conventional
  technology.  They were unveiled to the press and flown in front
  of the press.  The purpose was to explain accidental sightings
  or disclosure of REDLIGHT as having been the <ent type='ORG'>SNOWBIRD</ent> craft.
    <ent type='ORG'>LUNA</ent> is the alien base on the far side of the Moon.  It was
  seen and filmed by the <ent type='ORG'>Apollo Astronauts</ent>.  A base, a mining
  operation using very large machines, and the very large alien
  craft described in sighting reports as MOTHER SHIPS exist there.
    NRO is <ent type='ORG'>the National Recon Organization</ent> based at Fort Carson,
  <ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent>.  It is responsible for security for all alien or alien
  craft connected projects.
    <ent type='ORG'>DELTA</ent> is the designation for the specific arm of the NRO which
  is especially trained and tasked with security of these
  projects.
    JOSHUA is a project to develop a low frequency pulsed sound
  generating weapon.  It was said that this weapon would be
  effective against the alien craft and beam weapons.
    <ent type='ORG'>EXCALIBUR</ent> is a weapon to destroy the alien underground bases.
  It is to be a missile capable of penetrating 1000 meters of
  Tuff/hard packed soil such as that found in <ent type='GPE'>New <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent></ent> with no
  operational damage.  Missile apogee not to exceed 30000 feet
  <ent type='ORG'>AGL</ent> and impact must not deviate in excess of 50 meters from
  designated target.  The device will carry a 1 megaton nuclear
  warhead.
    ALIENS, there were 4 types of aliens mentioned in the papers.
  A LARGE NOSED GREY with whom we have the treaty, the GREY
  reported in abductee cases that works for the LARGE NOSED GREY,
  a blond human like type described as the <ent type='ORG'>NORDIC</ent>, a red haired
  human like type called the ORANGE.  The home of the aliens were
  described as being a star in the Constellation of Orion,
  Barnards star, and Zeta Riticuli 1&amp;2.  I cannot remember even
  under hypnosis which alien belongs to which star.
    <ent type='ORG'>EBE</ent> is the name or designation given to the live alien
  captured at the 1949 <ent type='GPE'>Roswell</ent> crash.  He died in captivity.
    <ent type='ORG'>KRLL</ent> OR <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>KRLL</ent>L</ent> OR CRLL OR CRLLL pronounced <ent type='ORG'>Crill</ent> or Krill was
  the hostage left with us at the first Holloman landing as a
  pledge that the aliens would carry out their part of the basic
  agreement reached during that meeting.  <ent type='ORG'>KRLL</ent> gave us the
  foundation of the yellow book which was completed by the guests
  at a later date.  <ent type='ORG'>KRLL</ent> became sick and was nursed by Dr. G.
  Mendoza who became the expert on alien biology and medicine.
  <ent type='ORG'>KRLL</ent> later died.  His information was disseminated under the
  pseudonym O.H. Cril or <ent type='ORG'>Crill</ent>.
    GUESTS were aliens exchanged for humans who gave us the
  balance of the yellow book.  At the time I saw the information
  there were only 3 left alive.  They were called (P&amp;#'s) Alien
  Life Forms.  [TRANSMI<ent type='ORG'>SS</ent>ION GARBLED]
    RELIGION  The aliens claim to have created Homo <ent type='ORG'>Sapiens</ent>
  through hybridization.  The papers said that RH-blood was proof
  of this.  They further claimed to have created all four major
  religions.  They showed a hologram of the crucifixion of Christ
  which the Government filmed.  They claim that Jesus was created
  by them.
    ALIEN BASES exist in the four corners area of <ent type='GPE'>Utah</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent>,
  <ent type='GPE'>New <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent></ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Nevada</ent>.  Six bases were described in the 1972
  papers, all on <ent type='NORP'>indian</ent> reservations and all in the four corners
  area. The base near <ent type='ORG'>Dulce</ent> was one of them.
    MURDER  The documents stated that many military and government
  personnel had been terminated (murdered without due process of
  law) when they had attempted to reveal the secret.
    CRAFT RECOVERIES  The documents stated that many craft had
  been recovered.  The early ones from <ent type='GPE'>Roswell</ent>, <ent type='NORP'>Aztec</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Roswell</ent>
  again, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent>, and other places.
    GENERAL <ent type='ORG'>DOOLITTLE</ent> made a prediction that one day we would have
  to reckon with the aliens and the document stated that it
  appeared that General Doolittle was correct.
    ABDUCTIONS were occurring long before 1972.  The document
  stated that humans and animals were being abducted and or
  mutilated.  Many vanished without a trace.  They were taking
  sperm and ova samples, tissue, performed surgical operations,
  implanted a spherical device 40 to 80 microns in size near the
  optic nerve in the brain and all attempts to remove it resulted
  in the death of the patient.  The document estimated that 1 in
  every 40 people had been implanted.  This implant was said to
  give the aliens total control of that human.</p>

<p>    CONTINGENCY PLAN SHOULD THE INFORMATION BECOME PUBLIC OR
  SHOULD THE ALIENS ATTEMPT A TAKEOVER.
    This plan called for a public announcement that a terrorist
  group had entered <ent type='GPE'>the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent></ent> with an <ent type='NORP'>Atomic</ent> weapon.  It
  would be announced that the terrorists planned to detonate the
  weapon in a major city.  Martial Law would be declared and all
  persons with implants would be rounded up along with all
  dissidents and would be placed into concentration camps.  The
  press, radio, and TV would be nationalized and controlled.
  Anyone attempting to resist would be arrested or killed.</p>

<p>    CONTINGENCY PLAN TO CONTAIN OR DELAY RELEASE OF INFORMATION
    This plan called for the use of MAJESTIC TWELVE as a
  disinformation ploy to delay and confuse the release of
  information should anyone get close to the truth.  It was
  selected because of the similarity of spelling and the
  similarity to <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12.  It was designed to confuse memory and to
  result in a fruitless search for material which did not exist.</p>

<p>    SOURCE OF MATERIAL CONTAINED IN THE DOCUMENTS WHICH I SAW
    The source of the material was an <ent type='ORG'>ONI</ent> counter-<ent type='ORG'>intel</ent>ligence
  operation against <ent type='ORG'>MJ</ent>-12 in order for the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> to find out the
  truth of what was really going on.  The <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> (at that time or at
  least the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> that I worked for) were not participants in any
  of this.  The different services and the government conduct this
  type of operation against each other all the time.  The result
  of this operation was that the <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> cut themselves in for a
  piece of the action (technology) and control of some projects.
    As you can see this file is only a little different from my
  previous file.  Only some names were scrambled previously to
  confuse the government long enough for someone to verify that
  what I have said is the truth.  I have added information in this
  file that puts me in absolute danger.  I have sent a copy of
  this file to people all over the country and will continue to do
  so.  Please get this file into as many hands as you can and
  maybe that will protect me but I doubt it.</p>

<p>    HISTORY WILL BE THE JUDGE OF ME AND THIS INFORMATION AND I
  HAVE NO FEAR OF THAT JUDGEMENT.  I SWEAR THAT THIS INFORMATION
  IS TRUE AND CORRECT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE.</p>

<p>    I wish to thank all those people who have aided me in reaching
  this point and for their pat<ent type='GPE'>ience</ent> and understanding.  I owe you
  all more than I can ever repay.
    Finally, it does not matter who is right and who is wrong or
  if a project name is in the wrong place.  It does not matter who
  is working for who or what is really what.  It should be obvious
  by now that something sinister and terribly wrong is going on
  involving the government and the UFO phenomenon.  We must all
  band together and expose it now.  I have done my part in the
  best manner that I could.  I can add nothing else except my
  testimony in <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> or a court of law that what I saw and have
  written in this file is true and that I saw it.
    Everything in my previous file that does not conflict with
  this file is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and
  some of it is from sources and research.  You may combine the
  files to get the entire picture.  Throw out only that
  information which conflicts with that contained in this file.
    There will be no further additions or corrections to this
  information either now or in the future.  My file is complete
  and stands to be judged by history.  Sometime in the future the
  exact papers that I saw will surface and you will all see this
  exact information contained within them.
