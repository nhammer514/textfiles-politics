    BUSH LINKED TO TERROR BOMBING;

    WILL U.N. ASK FOR EXTRADITION?:

    Shocking Evidence Revealed


The evidence pointing to President Bush's role in the terrorist bombing of
a <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>n</ent> airliner grows stronger with new revelations.  Will the <ent type='ORG'>UN</ent> Security
Council demand his extradition to <ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent> or the <ent type='ORG'>World Court</ent>, as Bush and the
<ent type='ORG'>UN</ent> have done in the case of <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Libya</ent>n</ent> suspects in a similar crime?

<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, DC, 6/12/92 -- Long-suppressed records have turned up
"shattering" new evidence of the role played by President George Bush in
the <ent type='ORG'>midair</ent> bombing of a <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>n</ent> airliner and in its subsequent cover-up,
<ent type='NORP'>Latin American</ent> officials conducting a "preliminary review" of the tragic
incident have told <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>UN</ent> Security Council</ent>.
   The secret files reportedly confirm that in mid-1976, while serving as
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> chief, Bush was in "overall command" of a botched sabotage operation
that ended in the crash of a <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>n</ent> passenger jet, killing all 73 aboard,
The SPOTLIGHT has learned from diplomatic sources close to the
investigation.
   A <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> agent identified as Luis Posada was arrested by <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Venezuela</ent>n</ent>
authorities shortly after the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>n</ent> plane exploded in <ent type='ORG'>midair</ent> during its
takeoff from a <ent type='LOC'>Caribbean</ent> stopover, these sources say.  Posada, a member of
a sizable <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> contingent conducting covert operations from <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Venezuela</ent>n</ent> bases
at the time, was charged with having smuggled an explosive device aboard
the flight, and held for trial.
   Bush, anxious to disclaim all responsibility for such an atrocious
terrorist outrage, ordered a "no-holds-barred" cover-up of the crime, the
record suggests.
   "In order to take the heat off Posada, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> targeted another
suspect, Dr. <ent type='ORG'>Orlando <ent type='ORG'>Bosch</ent></ent>, a militant <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>n</ent> exile activist who advocated
`armed action' against the Castro dictatorship," recounted Felipe Rivero,
the popular <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> broadcaster who is The SPOTLIGHT's correspondent in the
region."
   <ent type='GPE'>Venezuela</ent>'s secret police, known after its <ent type='NORP'>Spanish</ent> initials as DISIP,
maintained close relations with the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and followed its lead.  <ent type='ORG'>Bosch</ent> was
imprisoned and charged with complicity in the bombing in <ent type='GPE'>Venezuela</ent>.

    <ent type='ORG'>BUSH ORCHESTRATION</ent>

   The next move in the cover-up reportedly orchestrated by Bush was to
"recover" Posada, these sources day.  In a well-organized and lavishly
financed jailbreak, the alleged aerial bomber was spirited from <ent type='GPE'>Venezuela</ent>
to <ent type='GPE'>Panama</ent>, where the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> issued him a new set of identity documents under
the name of Ramon <ent type='LOC'>Medina</ent>, a <ent type='NORP'>Guatemalan</ent> businessman.
   In the concluding move of the cover-up, Posada, now known as "<ent type='LOC'>Medina</ent>,"
was handed over to Felix Rodriguez, a senior <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> field agent with whom Bush
had a personal working relationship, the record shows.  Rodriguez gave
Posada a series of covert jobs with <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> teams stationed in <ent type='LOC'>Central America</ent>,
largely in order to protect him and "keep him happy," these sources
related.
   "I, for my part, spent 11 years in various maximum security <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Venezuela</ent>n</ent>
prisons," <ent type='ORG'>Bosch</ent> told a SPOTLIGHT reporter during a recent telephone
interview.  "During those years, I was put on trial four times for that
airplane bombing.  My case was heard by military, civilian and appellate
courts.  I was found innocent each time.  But after each acquittal, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
came up with new `suggestions' about my guilt."

    <ent type='ORG'>PALE</ent> AND FRAIL

   Finally the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Venezuela</ent>n</ent> government told <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> it could no longer
hold <ent type='ORG'>Bosch</ent>.  Pale and in frail health, the falsely accused "terrorist" was
flown back to <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent>.  "Here I could hope for no acquittal," recounted
<ent type='ORG'>Bosch</ent>.  "At the airport, immigration officials threw me into chains.  I was
held in solitary confinement for 29 months."
   Finally granted a provisional release after leading <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>n</ent>-American
<ent type='NORP'>Republicans</ent> pressed his cause without letup, <ent type='ORG'>Bosch</ent> now lives in seclusion
near <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent>.  "My status is that of a `deportable' alien," he told The
SPOTLIGHT.  "If I engage in any political activity, or even if I talk too
much, I can be tossed back into jail.  I am in no position to comment on
controversial questions -- not even in my own cause."
   Living under the assumed name and a small <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> paycheck in Central
America also proved difficult for Posada, SPOTLIGHT correspondent Rivero
reports.  "A couple of years ago, two men walked up to Posada in a
<ent type='NORP'>Guatemalan</ent> restaurant and shot him five times," Rivero related.  "He
survived the shooting by a sheer miracle.  Badly injured -- he lives
largely on liquefied food and walks with a crutch, I hear -- he has
vanished into the `protective custody' of the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>."
   The reason for Posada's attempted assassination is known, however.  He
"drank a bit and began to talk too much," U.N. sources said.  "The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
needed an airtight cover-up of that airline bombing.  When Posada turned
talkative, his usefulness to Bush was at an end -- and, but for an iron
physique and that miraculous survival, he would have been, too."
   Now the U.N. Security Council, having assumed jurisdiction over such
international terrorist crimes when it clamped harsh sanctions on <ent type='GPE'>Libya</ent>
last April, faces a tougher challenge:  How to deal with a case of aerial
mass murder in which the principal suspect happens to be THE INCUMBENT
PRESIDENT OF THE <ent type='ORG'>UN</ent>ITED STATES.
