    THE SHEIK'S REWARD

    Will the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> Come Clean About Abdel Rahman?


   By Robert I. Friedman

Several prominent law enforcement officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, say that it appears that Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman was allowed to
enter <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent> because of his support for the <ent type='GPE'>mujahedeen</ent> -- the
fractious coalition of <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>-backed <ent type='NORP'>Islamic</ent> extremists who fought the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>
army in <ent type='GPE'>Afghanistan</ent> and later the moderate regime in <ent type='GPE'>Kabul</ent>.

<ent type='ORG'>The Voice</ent> revealed last week that in 1990 Abdel Rahman left <ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent> for
<ent type='GPE'>Peshawar</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent>, where he met rebel <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent> leader Gulbuddin <ent type='ORG'>Hekmatyar</ent>,
who was already providing training for the sheikh's militant fundamentalist
terrorist group in <ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent>, Al Gamaat al <ent type='ORG'>Islam</ent>ia.  The rebel camps were
"schools for Jihad," where fundamentalists from across the <ent type='NORP'>Muslim</ent> world
received courses in everything from making car bombs to shooting down
planes with <ent type='NORP'>American</ent>-made Stinger missiles.  After several months in
<ent type='GPE'>Peshawar</ent>, Abdel Rahman traveled to <ent type='GPE'>Khartoum</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Sudan</ent>, where he received a
U.S. tourist visa, despite his presence on a <ent type='ORG'>State Department</ent> terrorist
watch-list that should have barred him from the country.  In <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, where
he was also granted a green card, Abdel Rahman raised funds and recruits
for the <ent type='GPE'>mujahedeen</ent>, many of them first-generation <ent type='NORP'>Muslim</ent> immigrants living
in <ent type='GPE'>Brooklyn</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent>.  One was Mahmud Abouhalima, a World Trade
Center bombing suspect and an <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent> war veteran.

Not only did the sheikh encourage his flock of <ent type='NORP'>Muslim</ent> zealots to fight the
godless <ent type='NORP'>Russians</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Afghanistan</ent>, but he also exhorted his followers in
<ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent> to wage a terror campaign against Hosni Mubarak's secular government.
In a <ent type='ORG'>CNN</ent> interview Monday, Mubarak said that a current wave of terror
bombings in <ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent> was being funded by a U.S. group tied to Abdel Rahman.
"There is an association in <ent type='GPE'>New Jersey</ent> collecting a lot of money for the
refugees in <ent type='GPE'>Afghanistan</ent>," said Mubarak.  "All this money is now being
channeled to those extremists [in <ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent>]."

But even as the <ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent>ian government begged the U.S. not to coddle the
sheikh, who was smuggling cassettes of his fiery speeches into <ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent> --
much the way Ayatollah <ent type='GPE'>Khomeini</ent> did from his safe-haven in <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> before
the fall of the shah -- Abdel Rahman was also denouncing his patron,
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, as the root of all evil.

Although the sheikh is apparently at the heart of a far-flung terrorist
conspiracy, he is not considered a suspect in the <ent type='ORG'>World Trade Center</ent>
bombing.  Incredibly, the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> has not even questioned him about the blast,
and only last week was he reportedly placed under round-the-clock federal
surveillance.

"My gut feeling is that we are protecting the sheikh," says a law-
enforcement source familiar with the case.  "We got him a visa as a reward
for his help in <ent type='GPE'>Afghanistan</ent>."

The source worries that the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> appears to be shutting down the
investigation prematurely.  "My ears perked up when I heard the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> say
that they have apprehended all but one of the <ent type='ORG'>World Trade Center</ent> bombers,"
he says.  "These guys [the suspects) don't look like self-starters to me."
Professionals from abroad, he says, may have assisted the suspects.

The <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> already has been criticized for failing to untangle the terrorist
web around El Sayyid <ent type='ORG'>Nosair</ent>, following the murder of the <ent type='NORP'>Zionist</ent> demagogue
Rabbi Meir Kahane.  Just 12 hours after Kahane's shooting, the government
was espousing the theory that <ent type='ORG'>Nosair</ent> was a lone gunman, despite having
found considerable evidence that appeared to link him to a wider terrorist
network.

Sheikh Abdel Rahman causes chaos wherever he goes.  In <ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent>, his
organization assassinated Anwar Sadat.  Though acquitted himself, be was
imprisoned three times during the 1980s.  He finally left his homeland in
1990.  After a pilgrimage to <ent type='GPE'>Mecca</ent>, he traveled to <ent type='GPE'>Baghdad</ent>, where <ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent>ian
authorities believe he may have been involved in the planning of the
unsuccessful assassination of <ent type='GPE'>Egypt</ent>ian Interior Minister Mohammed Abdel-
Halim Moussa.

Abdel Rahman later slipped into <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent>, where he forged operational links
with Gulbuddin <ent type='ORG'>Hekmatyar</ent>, the head of a radical rebel <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent> army backed by
the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.  <ent type='ORG'>Hekmatyar</ent>'s career in politics began in 1972, when as an
engineering student at <ent type='GPE'>Kabul</ent> University, he founded the Young <ent type='NORP'>Muslim</ent>s,
which advocated turning <ent type='GPE'>Afghanistan</ent> into a single-party <ent type='NORP'>Islamic</ent> republic
based on the Sharia, or <ent type='NORP'>Islamic</ent> law.  In June 1974, <ent type='ORG'>Hekmatyar</ent> fled to
<ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent> after a government crackdown on <ent type='NORP'>Islamic</ent> fundamentalists.

<ent type='ORG'>Hekmatyar</ent> immediately began to call for the armed overthrow of <ent type='GPE'>Afghanistan</ent>
-- an idea that won the approval of <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent>i leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,
who supplied <ent type='ORG'>Hekmatyar</ent> with arms, training, and money.  <ent type='ORG'>Hekmatyar</ent>
orchestrated an insurrection in <ent type='GPE'>Afghanistan</ent> in 1975, but it was crushed.
Many of his followers subsequently joined him in <ent type='GPE'>Peshawar</ent>.

By 1979, six fundamentalist <ent type='NORP'>Muslim</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent>i rebel groups were operating in
<ent type='GPE'>Peshawar</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Hekmatyar</ent>'s was by far the largest and most important, thanks
to the support of his newest <ent type='GPE'>Pakistan</ent>i patron, President Mohammed Zia.  At
the time, the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>-backed, <ent type='NORP'>Marxist</ent> government in <ent type='GPE'>Afghanistan</ent> was
attempting to weaken the hold of the traditional religious elite, who for
centuries had  ruled the countryside.  The <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent>i <ent type='NORP'>Marxist</ent>s even went so
far as to remove the <ent type='NORP'>Islamic</ent> green from the <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent>i flag.  <ent type='ORG'>Hekmatyar</ent>
resisted, waging a fierce terrorist war.  In December 1979, the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>s,
fearing the violence would spill across their borders, invaded <ent type='GPE'>Afghanistan</ent>.
<ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent>i president Hafizullah Amin was killed in the royal palace by <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>
troops, and replaced by Babrak Karmal, an exile who had been living in
<ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent>.

<ent type='ORG'>Hekmatyar</ent>'s relationship with Abdel Rahman began around the time of the
<ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> invasion.  <ent type='ORG'>Hekmatyar</ent>, who had only cursory religious training, drew
his inspiration from the sheikh's attempts to overthrow Sadat and his call
for a pure <ent type='NORP'>Islamic</ent> state, where women would be veiled and children would be
scrupulously taught by mullahs.

During Abdel Rahman's visit to <ent type='GPE'>Peshawar</ent> in 1990, the two charismatic
leaders talked about spreading their holy war beyond the <ent type='NORP'>Muslim</ent> world into
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>, say several well-placed sources.  But one of their most pressing
concerns were the <ent type='NORP'>Islamic</ent> republics of the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union.  As early as 1987,
Hekmotyar's warriors were fighting <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> troops in <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Tajikistan</ent>,
according to <ent type='ORG'>the Washington Times</ent>.  Meanwhile, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> spent lavishly on
the <ent type='NORP'>Afghan</ent> rebels.  In 1987 alone, the <ent type='GPE'>mujahedeen</ent> received $640 million --
a sum matched by the <ent type='NORP'>Saudis</ent>.  Additional funds were raised in the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> and
among Abdel Rahman's <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> disciples.  At the same time, the U.S. was
building up the <ent type='NORP'>Iraqi</ent> war machine.  When U.S. aid to the <ent type='GPE'>mujahedeen</ent> stopped
in late December 1990 as part of an accord with <ent type='GPE'>Moscow</ent>, the ragtag army of
<ent type='NORP'>Islamic</ent> fundamentalists turned its wrath on <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>.  Around the same time,
<ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> swallowed <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>, forcing <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> into the <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> War.

It is not surprising the U.S. government is attempting to cover up its
relationship with Abdel Rahman.  It may take a congressional investigation
to unearth the extent of the sheikh's ties to U.S. intelligence.  Last
week's report in the Voice about <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> links to Abdel Rahman has "<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
officials running for cover," says a source close to the agency.

Instead of ducking, the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> should tell law enforcement what it knows about
Abdel Rahman and his <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> followers.  <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> files might shed light on the
letter to <ent type='ORG'>The New York Times</ent> from <ent type='ORG'>the Liberation Army Fifth Battalion</ent>,
which declared that the <ent type='ORG'>World Trade Center</ent> bombing was in retaliation for
<ent type='GPE'>America</ent>'s support for <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent> and pro-Western Arab regimes.  The letter
threatened that the bombings would continue unless <ent type='GPE'>America</ent> suspended aid to
<ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>.  Authorities told the <ent type='ORG'>Times</ent> that the letter was prepared by one of
the five suspects in custody.

Some terrorism experts fear that the <ent type='ORG'>World Trade Center</ent> bombing is the
first round in radical <ent type='ORG'>Islam</ent>'s war against <ent type='GPE'>America</ent>.  They point to a wave
of bombings in <ent type='GPE'>Paris</ent> in 1985 and 1986 that was masterminded by <ent type='GPE'>Tehran</ent>, and
facilitated by <ent type='NORP'>Iranian</ent> students and small businessmen living in <ent type='GPE'>France</ent>.
While the locals provided safehouses, bomb-making materials, and other
logistical support, professional terrorists from abroad carried out the
bombings and fled.  The <ent type='NORP'>French</ent> government later struck a secret deal with
the <ent type='GPE'>Khomeini</ent> regime.  <ent type='GPE'>France</ent> took a more "neutral" position in the <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>-
<ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent> war and released several imprisoned <ent type='NORP'>Iranian</ent>s.  In return, the bombings
stopped.  *
