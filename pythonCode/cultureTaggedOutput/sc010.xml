<p>Skolnick COMMENTARY #010
========================</p>

<p>[<ent type='ORG'>CfD</ent> Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve 
either all or portions of the following.]</p>

<p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put 
out by a group in <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up 
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>

<p>Hi! Sherman Skolnick, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts, 
9800 Oglesby.</p>

<p>More about the Clinton <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> scandals.</p>

<p>Some contend <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> aide Vincent Foster, jr. committed 
suicide *in* the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> and the body was removed and planted 
in a park in <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent>. If so, whoever moved the body used the 
opportunity to make it look like he was murdered. So the 
President and his wife would be guilty of being accomplices to 
murder by their coverup. [??]  Others contend the body shows 
Foster was apparently murdered and the body delivered to the park 
and positioned so as to cast suspicion on the <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent>.</p>

<p>Either way, Clinton has stonewalled the matter and arranged to 
hold back the release of the autopsy.</p>

<p>Foster and Hillary were not only lovers but also law partners, 
and worked on clandestine deals for the Bank of Criminals and 
Conspirators International [<ent type='ORG'>BCCI</ent>] -- involving money-washing for 
domestic and overseas political murders, gun-running, and dope- 
trafficking. Military <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> officers, posing as <ent type='ORG'>Justice Department</ent> 
officials, have twisted matters around so as to finger Bill 
Clinton.</p>

<p>But Clinton, after all, is no angel.</p>

<p>The mass media have soft-pedalled reports that Hillary's law firm 
has shredded records relating to the President and first lady's 
daily financial business. Some in the press are also slanting 
reports so as to blame Hillary alone, as if "Sludge Willy" is 
himself innocent. *Oh, yeah?!*</p>

<p>Left out of the press are key details:</p>

<p>ITEM: Some $47 million is missing from the Clinton's <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent> 
rotten dealings -- plundering an S&amp;L, funneling money through 
real estate firms, and other money [unclear].</p>

<p>ITEM: Clinton's nominee for head of the firm the S&amp;L bailout 
racket called "<ent type='ORG'>Resolution Trust Corporation</ent>" [<ent type='ORG'>RTC</ent>] wanted to 
clean up S&amp;L corruption. *But*, he withdrew his name. S&amp;Ls in 
<ent type='GPE'>Illinois</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Colorado</ent> have been plundered by <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> 
operatives and left bankrupt.</p>

<p>ITEM: The <ent type='ORG'>RTC</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> transferred some $50 million from a 
little-known contingency fund here to <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent>... the attempt 
to cover up the <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent> embezzlement done by the Clintons and 
their criminal gang.</p>

<p>The fund was administered for <ent type='ORG'>RTC</ent> by <ent type='ORG'>Household Bank</ent> as part of 
their merger with an S&amp;L in the <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> area. The head of the 
parent firm, <ent type='ORG'>Household International</ent>, an expert on financials, 
was murdered in April '93. Household is a successor to Nugan- 
Hand(sp?) Bank, the worldwide <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> front headquartered in 
<ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>.</p>

<p>ITEM: Federal judges in <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> have "stood on their head" to try 
to cover up the disappearance of the <ent type='ORG'>RTC</ent> fund here and the 
transfer to <ent type='GPE'>Arkansas</ent>. ([Allegedly] including <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> federal 
district judge George Lindbergh, who heads a "lie box" company 
with major clients <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>National Security Agency</ent>, and off-shore 
gambling casinos. Also, [allegedly] <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> federal bankruptcy 
judge John D. <ent type='ORG'>Schwartz</ent>.) It is referred to as "The Androcetti 
Affair"(sp?).</p>

<p>ITEM: Hillary Rodham Clinton is facing indictment by a federal 
grand jury in <ent type='GPE'>Little Rock</ent> for bank embezzlement and income tax 
fraud.</p>

<p>ITEM: Leading the attack on the Clinton <ent type='ORG'>White House</ent> is <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent> 
<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>man Henry Hyde, reportedly in charge of <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>'s bloody 
"black budget" [<ent type='ORG'>CfD</ent> -- This would be money budgeted for <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> 
"projects" by the <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> that for secrecy reasons does not 
appear in public documents]. Hyde has more actual power than the 
director of <ent type='ORG'>Central Intelligence</ent> to arrange political 
assassinations, to launder secret funds, and to railroad enemies 
into prison. Hyde has been director of a suburban S&amp;L here, now 
defunct, fronting for <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>. The federal court case of <ent type='ORG'>RTC</ent> against 
Henry Hyde was ordered suppressed because of "national security."</p>
