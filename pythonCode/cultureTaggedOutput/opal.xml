<p>"Fear them not, therefore; for there is nothing covered that shall

size to <ent type='LOC'>the <ent type='LOC'>North Sea</ent></ent> or <ent type='NORP'>Alaskan</ent> <ent type='LOC'>North Slope</ent>. Gas reserves alone
now estimated at 30 times bigger than <ent type='ORG'>Kapuni</ent> and oil reserves of
at least 20 billion barrels - enough for <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> to be
self-sufficient for years. Oil companies completely hushed up
these facts. To have announced a vast new oil source would
probably mean a decline in world oil prices, which would not have
allowed <ent type='ORG'>OPEC</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Onassis</ent> plans for the <ent type='NORP'>Arabs</ent> to eventuate. N.Z.
could be exploited at a later date, particularly since the North
Sea operations were about to come on stream - Kirk was the last to
hold out.</p>

<p>September, 1974: According to <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> sources, Kirk was killed by the
<ent type='ORG'>Trilateralist</ent>s using Sodium Morphate. Rowling's first act as <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent>
Prime Minister was to withdraw Kirk's Anti-Monopoly Bill and the
Petroleum Amendment Bill.</p>

<p>Later, Rowling was to be rewarded with ambassadorship to
<ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>.  Incidentally, the Shah of <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> was murdered the same
way as Kirk on his arrival in the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent>.</p>

<p>6th October, 1974: Ray cline implements William Colby plan to oust
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent>n Prime Minister <ent type='ORG'>Whitlam</ent>. <ent type='ORG'>Nugan Hand</ent> Bank finances
payoffs to Malcolm Fraser and other pro-<ent type='GPE'>US</ent> politicians. A joint
bugging operation commences between <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and ASIA.</p>

<p>Rupert <ent type='ORG'>Murdoch</ent>, playing his part, uses his newspapers and
television network to spread lies and misinformation. <ent type='ORG'>Whitlam</ent>, as
well as refusing to waive restrictions on overseas borrowing to
finance the aluminium consortium, had plans to ensure that all
corporations were at least 50% <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent>n-owned. This interfered
with the <ent type='ORG'>Seven Sisters</ent>' plans to build three oil refineries at
<ent type='GPE'>Cape Northumberland</ent> in South <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent> to exploit the Great South
Basin discovery.</p>

<p>December, 1974: <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent>n Governor-General John Kerr joins Ray
Cline's payroll and received his first pay-off of $<ent type='GPE'>US</ent>200000
credited to his account number 767748 at the <ent type='GPE'>Singapore</ent> branch of
<ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Nugan Hand</ent> Bank</ent>.</p>

<p>11th November, 1975: Governor-General Kerr sacks the <ent type='ORG'>Whitlam</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>.</p>

<p>August 1975: Rowling re-introduces unrecognisable <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent> Bill,
designed to aid monopolisation of the <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent> economy and repeals the
News <ent type='ORG'>Media</ent> Ownership Act, allowing more foreign ownership of <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent>
media. The new legislation does not define monopoly, competition
or stipulate permissable maximum market share, or even ascertain
what the public interest is - resulting in a sell-out to big business.</p>

<p>December, 1975: Election battle between Rowling and Muldoon. Oil
companies pour thousands of dollars into Muldoon's campaign via
National Bank (<ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent>), whose general manager Mowbray is also a member
of Todd Foundations; Investment Board Director Tudhope also Managing
Director <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent> Oil and Chairman <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/Todd. Muldoon wins.</p>

<p>February, 1976: Muldoon implements pre-election secret agreement
with the <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Seven Sisters</ent>' oil representatives of <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/Todd
for helping finance the <ent type='ORG'>National Party</ent> campaign.</p>

<p>Muldoon removes the $3 per barrel oil levy for the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>
Refining Company, which increases the oil companies' profits by
100% at the taxpayers' expense and with all future oil prospecting licenses,
the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> has the option to take 51% of any discovery without
meeting exploration costs. This is designed to discourage further
exploration, thereby keeping the lid on the <ent type='LOC'>Great South Basin</ent>
discovery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent>, new P.M. Malcolm Fraser reopens uranium
mining and opens the way for takeover of mineral resources with
big tax breaks for oil exploration, coal and mining.</p>

<p>Muldoon returns a favour to the oil companies by arranging $<ent type='GPE'>US</ent>200
million loan for <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Maui</ent> Gas Development</ent> for <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/Todd.</p>

<p>September, 1976: With captive politicians in place in both
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>, the <ent type='NORP'>Internationalists</ent> can now proceed
with their strategy of takeover of the economy and exploitation of
natural resources. "In <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>, the elimination of unnecessary
competition is fundamental to a sound economy," Brierly says.</p>

<p>Parksy and Colby use Brierly/Jones Investments as a vehicle to buy
into A.B. <ent type='ORG'>Consolidated Holdings</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>.</p>

<p>Associate of R. Jones, Pat <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>, is appointed 'consultant' of
A'<ent type='NORP'>asian</ent> and <ent type='ORG'><ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Holdings</ent>.</p>

<p>November, 1976: The <ent type='NORP'>Internationalists</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>) set up a <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent> money
'funnel' using <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>City Realties</ent>. <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>National Insurance</ent> Co</ent>
acquires 33% of the stock. Largest stockholders in National
Insurance are the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> Firemen's Fund
- Chairman and President Myron Du Bain also Vice Chairman of
American Express (<ent type='ORG'>Amex</ent>). Chairman of I.E.L. linked International
Harvester, Archie McCardell, also <ent type='ORG'>Amex</ent> Director. <ent type='ORG'>Amex</ent> linked with
<ent type='ORG'>Chase <ent type='GPE'>Manhattan</ent></ent> and seven Sisters' Texaco and <ent type='ORG'>Mobil</ent>. Du Bain also
Director of <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>-linked United <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> Bank, which is a partner
in Commercial <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Trust.</p>

<p>To complete the money funnel, <ent type='ORG'>National Insurance</ent> becomes a
stockholder in <ent type='ORG'>Chase <ent type='GPE'>Manhattan</ent></ent>'s Chase-NBA.
<ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>'s declared assets reach $100 million, with shareholder's
capital of only $2.5 million - all cash acquisitions.</p>

<p>3rd February, 1977: Parksy and Colby close down the <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>/Jones
Investment funnel and open up seperate channels for <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and
Jones.  Jones will be supplied with 'laundered' funds via <ent type='GPE'>Sydney</ent>
branch of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Nugan Hand</ent> Bank</ent>, while for Ron <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, Gerald
Parsky uses Myron Du Bain, Dierctor of United <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> Bank and
also chairman and president of the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> Firemen's Fund, which are
the largest stockholders in <ent type='ORG'>National Insurance</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent>). Funds to be
'laundered' via <ent type='ORG'>Chase <ent type='GPE'>Manhattan</ent></ent> Bank through <ent type='ORG'>National Insurance</ent> to
City Realty and via United <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> Bank through
<ent type='ORG'>COMPAC</ent> (<ent type='LOC'>New Hebrides</ent>) to <ent type='ORG'>National Insurance</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>City Realties</ent>.</p>

<p>To expand the Bierley/I.E.L. 'front', Parsky establishes
Industrial Equity <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> (<ent type='GPE'>Hong Kong</ent>).</p>

<p>September 1977: <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>'s new holding company begins operations -
A.B.  Consolidated. H.W. <ent type='ORG'>Revell</ent> appointed Deputy Chairman and B.
Hancox General Manager, while newly-appointed directors include S.
Cushing, B.  Judge, O. Gunn and P. <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>, linked with <ent type='ORG'>Renouf</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Papps</ent> through I.E.L./N.Z.U.C.</p>

<p>* Strategy: To target and divide key sectors of the economy for
takeover, exploitation and monopolisation. <ent type='ORG'>Operations</ent> to extend to
use <ent type='GPE'>Hong Kong</ent> facility, I.E.P. <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>s to extend the
<ent type='ORG'>Khashoggi</ent>/<ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Travelodge</ent> operation by taking holdings in
<ent type='ORG'>Vacation Hotels</ent> and Intercontinental Properties (<ent type='ORG'>Renouf</ent>
Chairman).</p>

<p>October, 1977: Muldoon and JOhn Todd - <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/Todd - sign an
agreement.  <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent> Govt would take 24.5% holding in the Great South
Basin for $1.65 Billion.  Hunt would reduce his holding from 45.5%
to 27.5% and <ent type='ORG'>Arco</ent> would sell its 6.5%.</p>

<p>* Reason: Hunt did not possess the technology to pump oil from
deep water; <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> possessed the technology but did not tell Hunt.
<ent type='ORG'>Arco</ent> was not told anything and were swindled out of its 6.5% concession.</p>

<p>November, 1977:  Muldoon introduces the S.I.S Amendment Bill,
designed to keep the economy free of obstruction and to help
uncover obstructive elements.  Telephone taps, mail tampering and
other surveillance methods approved after <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> input on contents of
legislation.</p>

<p>Late 1977:  Muldoon travels to the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> to meet top <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>
officials, including <ent type='ORG'>Trilateralist</ent>s' Deputy Secretary of <ent type='ORG'>State</ent>,
Warren Christopher, and Richard Bolbrooke, who were in charge of
the new "South <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Desk" at the <ent type='ORG'>State</ent> Department established
by <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> to target exploitatin of both <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> and
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent>.  In <ent type='GPE'>Los Angeles</ent>, Muldoon meets top <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>
officials, Robert Anderson (<ent type='ORG'>Rockwell</ent> Chairman, also Director of
<ent type='GPE'>Kashoggi</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>Security <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent></ent> National Bank) and P. Larkin (<ent type='ORG'>Rockwell</ent>
Director, also Chairman, <ent type='ORG'>Executive</ent> Committee <ent type='ORG'>Security <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent></ent>
National Bank and Director of Marac).</p>

<p>April, 1978:  Muldoon sets up <ent type='ORG'>Petrocorp</ent>.  <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> taxpayers
pay for the exploration costs but the oil companies control all
distribution outlets.  Muldoon blocks development of <ent type='LOC'>Maui</ent> B as
restructured supplies mean higher prices and bigger profits for
<ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/Todd.  <ent type='LOC'>South Island</ent> gas market not developed as Great
South Basin fields closer than <ent type='ORG'>Kapuni</ent>.  Plans develop for
re-opening of <ent type='ORG'>National Parks</ent> for mineral exploitation.</p>

<p>22nd July, 1978: Director of <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent>n Federal Bureau of
Narcotics suspends his invetigation into <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Nugan Hand</ent> Bank</ent> after
pressure from the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent>n politicians controlled by
<ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>, particularly Malcolm Fraser.</p>

<p>Brierly's declared assets reach $200 million, with shareholders'
funds only $17 million.</p>

<p>May, 1979: <ent type='ORG'>Trilateral Commission</ent> secretary Zbignieu Brzezinski
appoints Muldoon chairman of Board of Governors of IMF/World Bank
on orders of
David <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>.  Muldoon would head three-man administration
committee which included <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> Finance Minister Mitchell Sharp,
key figure in the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Council</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>Trilateral Commission</ent>.
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent>n Treasurer McMahon also involved.</p>

<p>8th June, 1979: Michael Hand, Frank Nugan, <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and James
Fetcher meet in Hand's <ent type='GPE'>Sydney</ent> penthouse to discuss the
establishment of the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> organisation.</p>

<p>Mid- 1979: <ent type='LOC'>Gulf</ent> Oil using its man <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, begins operations
designed to capture key sectors of the economy.  A.B Consolidated
restructured into the <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent> Group and <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent> to run operations
but with the majority of the stock held by IEL and <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> using
<ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent> companies plus dummy corporations.</p>

<p>* Strategy:  To take over food and produce resources, <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and
<ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> restructured a small private company, H.W. Smith, using
Cyril Smith as Chairman but with key executives Judge, Collins and
McKenzie. Bob Jones helps.</p>

<p>Private company used, as no <ent type='ORG'>Commerce</ent> Commission control, accounts
not published, no public disclosure of transactions.  Bunting is
established as a shell company and the <ent type='LOC'>South Island</ent> is targeted
for asset-stripping and takeover, as well as key sectors of the
automobile industry.</p>

<p>Unlimited funds channelled through <ent type='ORG'>City Realties</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent>UC and Marac.
<ent type='ORG'>UEB</ent> extends <ent type='ORG'>Travelodge</ent> operations by buying control of
<ent type='ORG'>Transholdings</ent>, which has strategic holdings in <ent type='ORG'>Vacation Hotels</ent> and
Tourist <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>. <ent type='GPE'>Fiji</ent> Holdings.</p>

<p>17th August, 1979:  <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> inaugral meeting in <ent type='GPE'>Sydney</ent>
including Hand, <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>, R.<ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent>, Alan
Hawkins and L.<ent type='ORG'>Papps</ent>.</p>

<p>Key sectors of the economy would be taken over- food, using
<ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>; forestry and farming, using <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent>;
property, using <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and Jones.  <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, Hand and <ent type='ORG'>Papps</ent>
would be responsible for banking, insurance and finance, while
<ent type='ORG'>Hand and Hawkins</ent> would be responsible for setting up new "laundry"
channels into <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>.</p>

<p>The economy would be taken over using cheap loans of less than 5%,
while consumers would pay 28%.</p>

<p>October, 1979:  <ent type='ORG'>BP Oil</ent> begis $100 million joint venture deal with
<ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent> at Tasman.</p>

<p>Muldoon makes secret deal with oil companies which effectively
robs <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> taxpayers by giving <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/Todd the <ent type='LOC'>Maui</ent> Gas
deal.  Normally the granting of drilling rights on public land is
done using a worldwide system which incorporates an auction tender
system.  Muldoon bypassed this. Also, <ent type='ORG'>Shell</ent>/BP/Todd pays no tax
on <ent type='ORG'>Kapuni</ent> profits, while putting funds into <ent type='LOC'>Maui</ent> development.</p>

<p>19th November, 1979:  Secret meeting in <ent type='GPE'>Auckland</ent> between Muldoon,
<ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent> to transfer 43% <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Tasman Pulp</ent> and Paper</ent> held by
<ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> to Challenge <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>oration (Chairman <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent>)
and <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>s.  Tasman has lucrative 75-year contract for cheap
timber signed in 1955.</p>

<p>Muldoon paid off with a $1 million 'non-repayable' loan - $500000
to be paid into account number 8746665 at <ent type='LOC'>New Hebrides</ent> branch of
the <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent>n International Bank.</p>

<p>November, 1979:  Muldoon drops restrictions on foreign investment.
AMAX (Stnadard Oil of <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> subsidiary) captures the Martha
Hill goldmine.</p>

<p>Muldoon unveils the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>'s plans (instructed by <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>)
to form <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> into an offshore production base for the
multi-national corporations as benefits include government export
incentives, stable government, cheap labour, and so on.</p>

<p>27th November, 1979:  Gerald Parsky's lieutenant, David Kennedy,
meets Muldoon to deliver $<ent type='GPE'>US</ent>100000 cash to Muldoon for
implementing the <ent type='NORP'>Internationalists</ent>' <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> Think Big plans.</p>

<p>These plans began with big contracts and guaranteed profits for
the <ent type='ORG'>Seven Sisters</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Bechtel</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Mitsubishi</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Mitsui</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Nippon Steel</ent>,
<ent type='NORP'>Internationalists</ent>' <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> banks.</p>

<p>With the experimental petroleum plant, the oil price has to be
$50/barrel to be profitable, yet <ent type='ORG'>Mobil</ent>'s profits are guaranteed.</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Steel is to be expanded 500%, even though there was a
global steel glut of 50%.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>s own 10% of <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Steel and are majority
stockholders in <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Steel and control monopoly over wire rod,
reinforcing steel.  Aslo, <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> taxpayers subsidise
<ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>s' profits.</p>

<p>Muldoon introduces the National Development Bill with 'fast-track'
legislation, to keep the economy 'free of obstruction' for
long-term monopolisation.</p>

<p>C.E.R. plan introduced, designed to integrate the economies of
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> with the <ent type='ORG'>Trilateral Commission</ent> for the
purpose of exploiting the South <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> countries and as a
'back-door' entrance into <ent type='GPE'>China</ent> - the world's largest untapped
consumer market.  <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> is also the closest country to
<ent type='LOC'>Antarctica</ent>, which has a vast mineral resource for future
exploitation.</p>

<p>"Think Big" projects begin, even though Muldoon aware of studies
that show <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> could conserve up to 40% of energy
consumption using existing technology, which would mean funds
could be invested elsewhere to lower consumer prices, lower
inflation rates, less demand for imported oil and increased
imployment by creating new industry to manufacture and install
energy-saving technology.  None of these options seriously
considered as all would lessen profits for members of the
<ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> organisations.</p>

<p>December 1979:  Muldoon unveils 'stage two' of a four-stage plan
to exploit the <ent type='LOC'>Great South Basin</ent> discovery.  Plan prepared by
<ent type='ORG'>Trilateralist</ent> 'Think Tank' - the Brookings Institute.</p>

<p>'Stage Two' includes methanol plant and synthetic petrol plant,
which would initially use gas from the <ent type='LOC'>Maui</ent> field and later would
link with underwater gas pipe from <ent type='LOC'>Campbell Island</ent>.</p>

<p>With the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Steel 500% expansion, 'stage three' of the
project and Think Big contracts to go to <ent type='ORG'>Bechtel</ent>, Fluor <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>.,
<ent type='ORG'>Mitsubishi</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Mitsui</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Nippon Steel</ent>, etc.  All investments would be
financed by the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> taxpayer.</p>

<p>17th January, 1980:  $500000 deposited in Muldoon's account
number 8746665 at the <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent>n International Bank, being the
final payment for the Tasman deal.</p>

<p>Early 1980:  <ent type='GPE'>Kashoggi</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Travelodge</ent> operations extended with
affiliation agreement between <ent type='ORG'>Dominion Breweries</ent> and Western
International Hotels (<ent type='ORG'>Seattle First National Bank</ent>).</p>

<p>May, 1980:  <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>Nugan Hand</ent> banking operation crashes after
Frank Nugan killed.  Death ruled as suicide even though no
fingerprints found on the rifle.  Maloney, Houghton, Yates and
Hand shred important documents, but miss some.  <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> helps Hand and
Bank President Donald Beasley escape to the U.S.  The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent>n Security Intelligence Organisation cover everything up.
<ent type='ORG'>Beazley</ent> appointed President of <ent type='ORG'><ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> City National Bank</ent>, run by
Alberto Dugue for 'laundering' profits from the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Colombia</ent>n</ent>
cocaine operation.</p>

<p>There is a probability that Michael Hand killed Frank Nugan
because of his involvement with Hand's fiancee.</p>

<p>25th May, 1980:  Colby arrived in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent> to discuss replacement
of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Nugan Hand</ent> Bank</ent> with Hand, <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, and Seldon.  Immediate
funding available from <ent type='GPE'>Sydney</ent> branch of the <ent type='ORG'>Deak Bank</ent>, a separate
<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> operation, and IEL would be used to buy <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent>I <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>., to prepare
for future laundering operations.</p>

<p>Maloney, Houghton, Yates, and Hand would shred all documents
leading back to the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Great South Basin</ent> connection, and
the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> would help <ent type='ORG'>Hand and Bank</ent> President Donald <ent type='ORG'>Beazley</ent> escape
to the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent>A.  The <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>ASIO</ent> would also cover everything up.</p>

<p>Hand and <ent type='ORG'>Beazley</ent> turn up in <ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> - <ent type='ORG'>Beazley</ent> appointed President
and Hand 'consultant' to the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='GPE'>Miami</ent> City National Bank</ent>, but also
Hand turned up in <ent type='GPE'>El Salvador</ent> to help organise bankrolling of the
<ent type='NORP'>Contras</ent> with other ex- members of Nugan-Hand.</p>

<p>23rd June, 1980:  <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>, including <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>,
<ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent>, Jones, Hawkins, <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>, and <ent type='ORG'>Papps</ent> meet in <ent type='GPE'>Wellington</ent> to
discuss merger of <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> Challenge and Tasman.</p>

<p>In order to replace <ent type='ORG'>Nugan Hand</ent> Bank's 22 world-wide branches,
quick moves are made to buy control of <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent>I by <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent>
using <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, thereby capturing an established, world-wide
organisation through the <ent type='GPE'>Hong Kong</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Shanghai</ent> Bank, which is
also linked to the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> through its subsidiary, World Finance
<ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>oration.</p>

<p>Late 1980:  <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>s, with strong <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent> links, obtains
lucrative contracts on <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> Bases in the <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> and joint ventures
in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent> Arabia</ent> and Iraq.</p>

<p>Control extended over <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> natural resources - <ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent>
Challenge and <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Tasman Pulp</ent> and Paper</ent> merged.  <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent>FP takes control of
M.S.D. Spiers and Moore Le Messurier (<ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>).  <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> begins
joint venture with <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent>FP through Williamson and Jeffrey.  I.E.L,
through <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>, buys 20% of <ent type='ORG'>Watties</ent> and begins cross-shareholding
agreement.  <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent> continues buying up control of <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent> bakeries and
flour- mills.</p>

<p>February, 1981:  <ent type='ORG'>TNL</ent>., <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, AMOIL and <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>MIM</ent> Holdings</ent> begin
joint gold mining operation.  <ent type='ORG'>MIM</ent> major shareholder is <ent type='ORG'>ASARCO</ent>
(<ent type='GPE'>US</ent>), whose Chairman, Barber, is also Director of <ent type='ORG'>Chase <ent type='GPE'>Manhattan</ent></ent>
Bank.</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Insurance and <ent type='NORP'>South British</ent> merger.
<ent type='ORG'>Parliamentarians For World Order</ent> - Richard Prebble elected on of

retains his connection through his Charter <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>oration's holding
in Teltherm.</p>

<p>January 1984:  <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and Elliott begin moves to monopolise the
food industry in <ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralasia by merging <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent> and the Elders
Group, while <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> sells 10% of <ent type='ORG'>Watties</ent> to the <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent> Dairy Board -
setting the stage for land takeover and establishment of the
<ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>orate Farm.</p>

<p>February 1984:  <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> politician D. <ent type='ORG'>Lange</ent> meets Ray Cline in
<ent type='GPE'>Wellington</ent> and agrees to go on the <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> payroll for monthly fee
of $<ent type='ORG'>UA</ent>40000 paid into account number 5263161 at Commercial
<ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> Trust, <ent type='LOC'>New Hebrides</ent>.</p>

<p>March 1984:  Muldoon knighted with GCMG for keeping the economy
free of obstructions for easier takeover and exploitation.</p>

<p>24th May, 1984:  Four-man <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> team co-ordinated by Ray Cline
arrive in <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> to begin installation of equipment for
subliminal television advertising at five sites - <ent type='ORG'>Waiatarua</ent>, Mt
Erin, <ent type='GPE'>Kaukau</ent>, <ent type='LOC'>Sugarloaf</ent> and Obelisk.</p>

<p>Sophisticated equipment can be installed within one kilometer of
TV relay <ent type='ORG'>arrials</ent> and all linked to one <ent type='ORG'>IDAPS</ent> computer bureau in
<ent type='GPE'>Auckland</ent>.</p>

<p>Same equipment installed in <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent> August 1985; <ent type='GPE'>Japan</ent> September
1986; <ent type='GPE'>UK</ent> February 1987: <ent type='GPE'>New York</ent> 1987.  Also, <ent type='ORG'>Amax</ent> geoligists now
estimate Martha Hill gold source could be worth up to $30 billion
on strength of high gold/tonne ore assay.</p>

<p>17th July, 1984:  In <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>, subliminal advertising begins on
<ent type='ORG'>Channel Two</ent> between 6pm and midnight - hours later extended to
begin at noon.  Subliminal messages prepared in the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> by the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
and with <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> election imminent, tell voters to support the
<ent type='ORG'>Labour</ent> Party, the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Party and to buy <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> company
products.</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Party was formed to ensure that Muldoon would lose, as
<ent type='ORG'>Big Business</ent> unhappy with controls over economy.  Big campaign
contributions from <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, the oil companies and the Business
Round Table ensure a <ent type='ORG'>Labour</ent> victory.</p>

<p>Later, <ent type='ORG'>Lange</ent> agrees to repay the favour to <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> by selling the
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> holding in the Kariori Pulp Mill to <ent type='ORG'>Winstones</ent>.  New
Zealand taxpayer loses $100 million.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> then becomes the arm of big business, using economic
policies provided by the  Business Round Table, implemented by
Finance Minister Roger Douglas and the package being sold by David
<ent type='ORG'>Lange</ent>, who also keeps up a noisy <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> directed A<ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent><ent type='GPE'>US</ent> withdrawal
campaign.</p>

<p>* Reason:  1) A<ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent><ent type='GPE'>US</ent>  Treaty did not cover <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> requirements over
the <ent type='LOC'>Great South Basin</ent> discovery;  2) To identify any oppositin or
threats within <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> who align themselves with supposed
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> policy, <ent type='ORG'>Lange</ent> increases the <ent type='ORG'>SIS</ent> budget and strangthens
links with the <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>.</p>

<p>Brookings Institute are the actual designers of the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> econmomic policies provided by the Business Round Table
(<ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> front) and implented by the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>.</p>

<p>Douglas devalues the dollar and deregulates interest rates, which
means cheaper labour, cheaper capital assets and high mortgage
rates, thereby implementing <ent type='ORG'>Big Business</ent> policy of driving farmers
off the land, establshment of the corporate farm and eventually
remove viability of small business sector, etc.</p>

<p>27th September, 1984: <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> meets at new 'safe
house' registered under Fernyhough's name, in <ent type='GPE'>Auckland</ent>.  Those

McConnell.  Daigo Miyado announces appointment of <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent> as
International Vice President of the <ent type='ORG'>Trilateral Commission</ent> <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent>
Basin Economic <ent type='ORG'>Council</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> outlines strategy of privatisation of the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> and the establishment of the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> Centre for
Independent Studies which will be chaired by Gibbs, aided by
Fernyhough and controlled by Cline, which will 'advise' <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent>
on privatisation.</p>

<p>Parsky, <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and Seldon hold a separate meeting with Parsky,
outlining plans for an expanded laundry operation which will
coincide with the launch of 'Crack' - a new addictive product
developed by <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> chemists for the world market.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Equiticorp</ent> (<ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>) will be launched with Adler as Manager and a new
merchant bank using Eldrs, <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent> and Jarden.</p>

<p>IEI will merge with <ent type='ORG'>Armco Bank</ent>, which has 20 branches in South
East <ent type='LOC'>Asia</ent>; Ariadne will acquire <ent type='ORG'>the Bank of Queensland</ent>, and
<ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> Investments will form a cross-shareholding with <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent>I <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>
to further increase control by their <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> organisation.  Other
plans include the laundering of funds directly to the <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>
and <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent>n <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>s and the establishment of key companies
within the economies of <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent>, <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Hong Kong</ent>.</p>

<p>The first key company will control the food industry in
<ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralasia through merger of Elders, <ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>s, <ent type='ORG'>Allied Mills</ent>,
Fielder Gillespie and <ent type='ORG'>Watties</ent>.  <ent type='ORG'>Allied Mills</ent> will control 30%
<ent type='ORG'>Goodman</ent>s, 30% Fielder, 20% <ent type='ORG'>Watties</ent> and will expand into <ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent> via
acquisition of Rank, Hovis McDougall (<ent type='GPE'>UK</ent>).  <ent type='ORG'>Allied Mills</ent> will be
controlled through IEL.</p>

<p>26th October, 1984:  <ent type='ORG'>Trotter</ent>, Hawkins, <ent type='ORG'>Lange</ent> and Douglas meet in
<ent type='GPE'>Wellington</ent> to implement <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> plans to privatise the <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>

owned by <ent type='ORG'>Sanwa Bank</ent>, Taiyo-Kobe Bank and Nomura Securities.  All

Chase-AMP Bank.</p>

<p>Elders woul be used as major 'vehicle' in the global liquor
economy with <ent type='ORG'>Courage Brewery</ent> in the <ent type='GPE'>UK</ent> to be used as entry into
<ent type='LOC'>Europe</ent>.</p>

<p>Strategy finalised to take over <ent type='ORG'>BHP</ent>, <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent>'s largest company,
using <ent type='ORG'>Holme</ent>'s A'<ent type='ORG'>Court</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, Elliott and Hawkins.</p>

<ent type='ORG'>Fletcher</ent> Challenge, <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent>I <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent>, Elders, Bell Group and
<ent type='ORG'>BHP</ent>.  <ent type='ORG'>Chase <ent type='GPE'>Manhattan</ent></ent> could then issue and buy stock to manipulate
the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ral<ent type='NORP'>asian</ent></ent> economy by increasing price, paying no taxes,
creating inflation, and enslaving the people through debt to mafia
controlled banks.</p>

<p>Parsky would oversee the 'launder' of further loans to the <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> and would begin to channel 'loans' through the
<ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent>n <ent type='ORG'>Treasury</ent> using captive politician Keating.  Also <ent type='ORG'>NZ</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> building would be sold to Jones and <ent type='GPE'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralia</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Government</ent> buildings would be sold to Adler which would then be
rented back to the respective <ent type='ORG'>Government</ent>s at inflated prices.</p>

<p>17th November 1986:  <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, Seldon, Packer, <ent type='ORG'>Bond</ent>, Elliott,

<ent type='ORG'>Murdoch</ent> to assist in Parsky strategy of media takeover in
<ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ralasia and the <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent> using Packer and <ent type='ORG'>Bond</ent> (TV and Radio)
<ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Holme</ent>s A'<ent type='ORG'>Court</ent> (newspapers).</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Murdoch</ent> takes orders from Brzezinski since his News <ent type='ORG'>Corp</ent> was taken
over in 1982 by <ent type='ORG'>Chase <ent type='GPE'>Manhattan</ent></ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Security <ent type='LOC'>Pacific</ent></ent> National
Bank.</p>

<p>At a separate meeting with <ent type='ORG'>Brierley</ent>, Seldon and Cline, Parsky
outlines plan for 'key' <ent type='ORG'>Media</ent> <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Aust</ent>ral<ent type='NORP'>asian</ent></ent> Holding company using
<ent type='ORG'>the Bell Group</ent> which would be taken over by with <ent type='ORG'>Chase <ent type='GPE'>Manhattan</ent></ent>
holding 27.5% in <ent type='GPE'>London</ent> and the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent>.  Another 10% of the stock

<p>8th February 1987:  <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Mafia</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Council</ent> meet in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> -
including David <ent type='ORG'>Rockefeller</ent>, John McCloy, Brzezinski, Parsky,
Simon, Katherine Graham, and George <ent type='ORG'>Franklin</ent>.</p>

<p>Brzezinski outlines plans to invade <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> using 75000 strong
mercenary army supported by <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> Air Force and <ent type='ORG'>Navy</ent> with starting
date of 8th February, 1988.  An integral part of the plan <ent type='NORP'>Saudi</ent>
and <ent type='GPE'>Kuwait</ent>i oil tankers would fly the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> flag to provoke an
<ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>ian attack so that <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> invasion of <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> would be 'justified'.</p>

<p>* Reason:  The <ent type='ORG'>Seven Sisters</ent> wanted to exploit a secret oil field
near Bandar Abbas discovered in 1976 with estimate 150 billion
barrels and also a huge gold source at <ent type='ORG'>Neyshabur</ent> discovered in
1977.</p>

<p>The <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>ian invasion would begin after the World economic system
was collapsed by the mafia controlled banks - target date 17th
January 1988.  Other countries on the takeover list include:
 * <ent type='GPE'>Mexico</ent> - for oil at <ent type='GPE'>Baisas</ent>
 * <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent> - for oil at <ent type='GPE'>Connto</ent>
 * <ent type='GPE'>Colombia</ent> -  for gold at Papayan
 * <ent type='GPE'>South Korea</ent> - for gold at Chunchon
 * <ent type='GPE'>New Zealand</ent> - for oil in the <ent type='LOC'>Great South Basin</ent>.</p>

<p>(Obviously this part of the plan failed to happen)</p>
