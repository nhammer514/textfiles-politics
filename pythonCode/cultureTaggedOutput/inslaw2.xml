<p>****<ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> Dept Allegedly Blocks Inslaw Investigation 03/05/92 <ent type='GPE'>WASHINGTON</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>DC</ent>, U.S.A., 1992 MAR 5 (NB) -- According to a <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>CNN</ent> Business</ent> report today, the
U.S.  <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> is harassing individuals who talk with investigators
who are looking into the Inslaw software case.  Inslaw, a <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> based
software company, has charged that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> made illegal copies
of its <ent type='ORG'>PROMIS</ent> legal case tracking software and sold or gave it to various
countries.</p>

<p>Former Attorney General and defeated <ent type='GPE'>Pennsylvania</ent> candidate for the U.S.
<ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent>, Richard Thornburgh, fought a futile battle to keep congressional
investigators from obtaining <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> files relating to the case,
and although a spokesperson for <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent></ent> is saying that
current head William P. Barr has ordered <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> employees to provide
"full support" to the investigation, <ent type='ORG'>CNN</ent> reports that Judge Bua said he is
aware of the allegations that <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> is harassing people who talk to his
investigators.</p>

<p>Judge Bua was appointed by Barr in November of 1991 to investigate the
allegations against his <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> but there has been some confusion over
just how much authority the retired federal judge has to force cooperation.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> says that the Attorney General's office is not aware
of any allegations of harassment, but <ent type='ORG'>CNN</ent> today carried an interview with
former <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> staffer Lois Battastoni who said that she knows
about such cases and that employees are in fear of losing their jobs if they
talk to the investigators.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Courts</ent> have already ruled in favor of Inslaw on several occasions, but the $8
million award to the small ($6 million gross) company was overturned on a
technicality.</p>

<p>More recently there have been suspicions voiced that the death of James D.
"Danny" Casolaro, a freelance writer who was investigating the Inslaw case,
was not a suicide as originally reported.</p>

Title:   Writing is on the wall for the move to open systems. (U.S. <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
   <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> Information Resources Management Chief Roger M. Cooper)
   (<ent type='ORG'>GCN</ent> Interview) (Interview)
Author:  Quindlen, Terrey Hatcher.</p>

<p>Summary: <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> Information Resources Management (<ent type='ORG'>IRM</ent>) Chief
   Roger M. Cooper has guided the department toward embracing open
   systems.  Currently, the department is putting together a policy
   paper that addresses multiuser systems below the level of
   mainframes.  Cooper would like systems to comply with Posix and to
   use <ent type='ORG'>the Government Open <ent type='ORG'>Systems</ent> Interconnection Profile</ent>.  The
   local area network standard will be the 10M-bps twisted-pair
   Ethernet servers and the word processing standard will be Word
   Perfect Corp's WordPerfect 5.1 software package.  Cooper and his
   staff are looking for ways to procure equipment and supplies, and
   he may investigate working with other agencies.  He supports the
   General Services Administration's policy of leaving 10 percent of
   big procurement contracts for other agencies.

<p><ent type='ORG'>GCN</ent>:  You have a reputation for supporting open systems.  Have you made any
efforts at <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> to move toward an open environment?</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>COOPER</ent>: We basically have done a lot of work with the <ent type='ORG'>IRM</ent> directors and the
components in the agencies.  We are putting together a policy paper that
covers multiuser systems below the mainframe level, because we've got a lot
of <ent type='ORG'>IBM</ent>-compatible mainframes.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Systems</ent> will be Posix-complaint and use the Government Open systems
Interconnection Profile.  The department's default for local area network
transmission media will be 10-megabit/<ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>, twisted-pair Ethernet servers.
It's a very flexible way to transmit.</p>

<p>For office automation, since everybody uses WordPerfect, we've said you've
got to use WordPerfect or at least have compatibility.  We mostly use Version
5.1.</p>

<p>We're also working at bringing some version of Unix up on the <ent type='ORG'>IBM</ent>-compatible
mainframes.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>, like most agencies, is very paperwork-oriented.  So we're trying to
come up with standards on how we image documents.</p>

<p>We've got a coordinating group for image standards that's met twice now.  The
group focuses on joint procurements because that's a growth industry.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>GCN</ent>: When you say joint procurements, do you mean with other <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> bureaus
or with other agencies?</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>COOPER</ent>: I mean mostly within <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>.  But we're always looking for other
procurement vehicles.  I've had lots of discussions with Thomas Buckholtz,
commissioner of <ent type='ORG'>the General Services Administration</ent>'s <ent type='ORG'>IRM</ent> Service, and Frank
McDonough, the assistant commissioner, about using every vehicle.  We were
the first people that called on Desktop IV, I think, to see if we could be on
it.  That was before it got protested.  But that's the way it goes.</p>

<p>I think <ent type='ORG'>GSA</ent>'s proposed policy of leaving 10 percent of certain big
procurements for other agencies is a good idea.  We had a very good
experience at <ent type='ORG'>the Farmers Home Administration</ent>.  We had some AT&amp;T 3B2
computers we got through a big office automation contract.  <ent type='ORG'>The <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent></ent>'s
AFCAC 251 had a similar set of hardware and software.  But there was a big
difference in the prices.</p>

<p>So we wanted the <ent type='ORG'>Agriculture</ent> contractor to change his prices.  He wasn't very
responsive until we bought a hundred or so computers from the <ent type='ORG'>Air Force</ent>
contract.  Then he got a lot more responsive.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Procurements</ent> are so tough that any time you can leverage back and forth, I
think it's a good idea.  So I'm glad <ent type='ORG'>GSA</ent>'s doing it.</p>

<p>The down side is if you've got a tightly integrated system and someone picks
out one part of it and says, "Gee, you can buy a PC cheaper here."  Certainly
some of the criticism we've had on our <ent type='ORG'>Project <ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent></ent> microcomputers is not
fair.  It's all bundled up with software and everything.</p>

<p>You've got to be careful that you're not cream-skimming on the whole thing.
It has to be a judgment call.  When the guy priced the thing, maybe he
unloaded part of the development costs in the price of the PC.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>GCN</ent>: When you came to <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>, the department's <ent type='ORG'>IRM</ent> had been under fire from
many sides, including <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>the General Accounting Office</ent>.  What goals
do you have for improving <ent type='ORG'>IRM</ent>?</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>COOPER</ent>: We have had criticism, but I think a lot of it has not been
justified.  Certainly we've had some problems.  The press <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> has had is
not commensurate with the level of sophistication of the systems or the
people.  I was pleasantly surprised at the competence level at <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>.</p>

<p>One area we're going to work on, and I think we probably did need a little
more work on, is computer <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity.  We have done a tremendous amount of
training and education, and gotten a lot tougher.  It has gotten further up
on the list of things we worry about.</p>

<p>I'm proposing putting together a computer <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity organization reporting
directly to me.  We're thinking about it, but I've got union negotiations.</p>

<p>In other areas, we've done some really neat things.  On our <ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent> system,
every morning when you fire up you PC, the local area network server scans
your hard disk to see if there's any viruses.  It takes a little longer.
When you turn the thing on, it is not available for about 5 minutes while the
network interrogates the PC.</p>

<p>We have found some viruses here, as everybody else in town has.  What's nice
is, when you find it, you know about it instantly.  Somebody doesn't have to
remember to turn the virus program on; it's done automatically.  If we get a
new change to the virus protection software, it goes on the system.
Eventually, 15000 PCs are going to be interrogated every morning for
viruses.</p>

<p>There's a lot of ways they could be introduced.  We probably have had less
viruses than most folks, but I'd say in the nine months I've been here, we've
had at least a half-dozen to a dozen instances.  A lot of them I don't even
have to worry about, because the system in many cases fixes them
automatically.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>GCN</ent>:  Last year, <ent type='ORG'>GAO</ent> said the U.S.  attorneys' offices were not getting
enough training in <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity procedures.  This year the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> Government
Operations Subcommittee on Government Information, <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> and <ent type='ORG'>Agriculture</ent>
said sensitive data in <ent type='ORG'>the Bureau of Prisons Sentry</ent> system was not getting
adequate protection.  Do you think those situations have improved?</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>COOPER</ent>: I don't necessarily agree with their assessment, but we've improved
those situations.  In the U.S.  attorneys' officers we've done a massive
education process.  A couple of months ago, they had a big computer <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity
conference here in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>.  They had, I think, 200 people there.  We have
had lots of training and have improved awareness in that organization by two
orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>In addition, we're going to be encrypting all the communications between the
U.S.  attorneys' offices.  Anytime they do communications outside the
controlled area, we're using some encryption.  It's not classified data, but
it's certainly very sensitive.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>GCN</ent>: How do you respond to the recent criticism of the <ent type='ORG'>Project <ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent></ent> office
automation buy from <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>s</ent> on <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee</ent>?</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>COOPER</ent>: A great many reports have a particular political spin out there.
I've heard the arguments about the particular spin on the thing, but that's
not unusual.  There have been some recommendations, and we will address them
back to the regular channels.  We're not getting into some kind of dialogue.
Enough has been said about the whole issue.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think we lose sight of what we're doing here.  We get hung up on
the process.  The question we ultimately should ask is: Is the customer
getting what he wanted?  I think with <ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent>, the answer would be a resounding
yes.  A lot of systems in town don't have happy customers.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>GCN</ent>: How is <ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent> giving the customers what they want?</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>COOPER</ent>: It's easy to use.  It's got great connectivity.  It's reasonably
inexpensive.  It's modular.  It's upgradeable.  And it has minimized the use
of proprietary technology.  It's been so successful that we've beat our best
projections for installing it.  We're talking 12000 workstations installed
in less than two years.  Within six months, we'll probably have them all
talking to each other.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>GCN</ent>: You said it's inexpensive.  One of the things the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> report said is
that you could go out in the stores and get computers cheaper than through
<ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>COOPER</ent>: An analogy would be like saying, "A tank weighs 60 tons and it's made
mostly of steel.  I could buy steel at $ 60 a ton."</p>

<p>The federal procurement system says you buy an integrated solution.  It
doesn't say you can go out and price the parts individually.  That would be
like taking a <ent type='ORG'>lapto</ent>p computer and weighing all the silicon and all the
solder.  If you added up a $2000 <ent type='ORG'>lapto</ent> with all the raw materials or
component parts, you would not get the value added in there.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>GSA</ent> publishers a report on PC prices.  The <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> PC prices,
which are mostly <ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent>, are right in the middle of that.  They're not the
lowest and they're not the highest.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>GCN</ent>: Are you still planning an agencywide case management software buy for
the <ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent> machines?</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>COOPER</ent>: Well, we didn't get any money, so we're re-evaluating that.  We're
taking a look at our options, given no money.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>GCN</ent>: That's tied in with <ent type='ORG'>Inslaw Inc</ent>. and the company's <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> case management
software.  Have you met with Judge Nicholas J. Bua, the special counsel the
attorney general appointed to investigate Inslaw's claim that <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> stole
copies of <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> and tried to drive the company into bankruptcy?</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>COOPER</ent>: I have not met him.  He has not talked to me.  Most of the Inslaw
thing happened years and years ago.  It has gone to numerous courts.  Our
position all along has been that it's a contract dispute that's gotten out of
hand.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>The Civil Division</ent> is handlign that.  The judge will do as the attorney
general wants him to do, and that's fine.  I think all of us in the
department would like to get it behind us.  It's sort of an albatross.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>GCN</ent>: What else is <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> doing in <ent type='ORG'>IRM</ent>?</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>COOPER</ent>: We're trying to work the open systems thing.  We're not making
everybody run their PC with Unix.  We're not making everybody take the
proprietary system and convert it over.  What we're saying is, if you buy
something new, this is what you should do.  We're trying to get a rational
move to open systems without throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p>

<p>I've been very pleased with the response.  <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> has a heavily
<ent type='ORG'>IBM</ent>-compatible mainframe background, yet I've found great interest in going
to open systems.  I think the handwriting is on the wall.</p>

<p>Even though <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent></ent> last week decided not to hear <ent type='ORG'>Inslaw Inc</ent>.'s
complaint against <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent>, the company's owners said they will
not give up their fight over rights to the <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> case management software.</p>

<p>Inslaw owners Nancy B. and William A. Hamilton said they plan to file a new
suit against <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent>, probably in the U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>District Court</ent> for
<ent type='ORG'>the District of Columbia</ent>.  The Hamiltons have alleged that <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> officials
stole versions of the company's <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> software and tried to force Inslaw
into bankruptcy.</p>

<p>"If you don't punish wrongdoing, it's going to come and bite you again,"
William Hamilton said last week at a briefing sponsored by Federal Sources
Inc., a consulting firm in McLean, <ent type='GPE'>Va</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> spokesman Joseph <ent type='GPE'>Krovisky</ent> said the department had no comment on the
<ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent> decision nor on the prospect of more litigation.</p>

<p>In November, Attorney General William P. Barr appointed Nicholas J. Bua, a
retired judge, to act as a special counsel to investigate the Hamilton's
8-year-old charges of wrongdoing by <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> officials.</p>

<p>Hamilton said <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>'s primary motivation in stealing Inslaw's software was
money, but surveillance of foreign governments might have been another
motive.</p>

<p>He said he has been told that the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>is</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>the Royal <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> Mounted Police</ent>
and <ent type='NORP'>British</ent> intelligence have had <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> software installed on their
computers.</p>

<p>Hamilton speculated that someone might have sold copies of <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> illegally
to foreign governments.  Those copies of the software might have had a hidden
feature that could transmit information to U.S.  surveillance systems, he
suggested.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> officials have denied these allegations repeatedly.</p>

<p>The Hamiltons' case has been heard in three courts.  The U.S.  Bankruptcy
Court in 1987 found in Inslaw's favor.  The U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>District Court</ent> for D.C.
affirmed that ruling in 1988 and awarded Inslaw $6 million.</p>

<p>Last year, the U.S.  Appeals Court for D.C.  overturned those rulings, saying
the bankruptcy court did not have the authority to rule on the matter.</p>

<p>Inslaw came out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1988 with a loan from <ent type='ORG'>IBM</ent> Corp.,
Nancy Hamilton said.  The company still sells <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> to state and local
governments, William Hamilton said.</p>

<p>The company also sells software for legal and insurance workload management
as well as <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent>.</p>

<p>****<ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent> Denies Inslaw Petition 01/14/92 <ent type='GPE'>WASHINGTON</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>DC</ent>, U.S.A.,
1992 JAN 14 (NB) -- The U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent> has refused to reinstate the
nearly $8 million fine which Inslaw had won against the U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> in earlier cases.</p>

<p>Inslaw had charged that during the Reagan administration the <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> had stolen the company's legal case-tracking software and sold it
to other agencies in the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent> and abroad.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent> had been petitioned to reinstate the $7.8 million fine
which had earlier be overturned because of a procedural error in which the
company had sued and won its case, but in the wrong court.</p>

<p>The ball is now back in Inslaw's court and the company has expressed
confidence that a retrial in the correct court will again result in its
winning a major award against the U.S.  government.  The <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent>

<p>****Suspect <ent type='ORG'>TISOFT</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent>ct Given <ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent>-Eye 12/06/91 <ent type='GPE'>WASHINGTON</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>DC</ent>, U.S.A.,
1991 <ent type='ORG'>DEC</ent> 6 (NB) -- <ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent>, a multi- billion dollar computer system being
installed by the U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>, was apparently a gold-plated
contract, according to a <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>ional investigation by <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent> Jack <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent>'
<ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee.  A <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent>-based firm, <ent type='ORG'>TISOFT</ent> was awarded the contract
for approximately 15000 workstations despite the fact that it had submitted
not the lowest but the <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ond highest bid.</p>

<p>Among the charges investigated by the committee were a possible relationship
between the <ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent> computer system and <ent type='ORG'>INSLAW</ent>-like software which was
originally specified for the system.  <ent type='ORG'>CNN</ent> reports that investigators contend
<ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent></ent> gave the winning bidder, <ent type='ORG'>TISOFT</ent>, a $200000 payment
which was allegedly used to pay off losing bidders who would otherwise have
contested the award to <ent type='ORG'>TISOFT</ent>.</p>

<p>The committee is still holding hearings on the possible <ent type='ORG'>INSLAW</ent> connection but
it has reported that the $200000 payment did take place and that, in its
estimation, <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> paid $18 million too much for the <ent type='ORG'>Project <ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent></ent> system.</p>

<p>In a televised interview seen on Friday's <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>CNN</ent> Business</ent> Morning, <ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>' 9th
District Representative Jack <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> stated, "We didn't find them stealing any
money, of course - we found ...  neglect.  It took <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> two
and one-half years to award a contract for equipment that was available in
stores."</p>

<p>As for the special payment, Rep.  <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> said, "It doesn't sound right that
<ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> of the <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent> gave them (<ent type='ORG'>TISOFT</ent>) $200000 to
pay off these people."</p>

<p>As for <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent>, spokesmen have pointed out that they did
nothing illegal.</p>

<p>According to <ent type='ORG'>CNN</ent>, Patrick Gallager, president of <ent type='ORG'>TISOFT</ent>, says that Rep.
<ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> doesn't understand the difference between buying commodity items off
the shelf and purchasing a complete integrated system.  He also reportedly
said that the payoffs were legal.</p>

Title:   Special counsel appointed to review Inslaw claims. (<ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
   <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> investigation involving Inslaw Corp.)
Author:  Quindlen, Terrey Hatcher.</p>

<p>Summary: The <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> will investigate allegations by <ent type='ORG'>Inslaw Inc</ent>
   owners, Nancy B. Hamilton and William A. Hamilton, who say that
   <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> stole computer software that belongs to
   them and tried to push their company into bankruptcy.  William P.
   Barr, the newly appointed attorney general, has appointed a
   special counsel, Nicholas J. Bua, to look into the Hamiltons'
   claims.  The Hamiltons are skeptical, saying that an investigator
   from outside <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> is needed.  It is not
   reasonable to expect, say the Hamiltons, that the <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
   <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> will do an adequate job if it is investigating itself.
   Nevertheless, the Hamiltons are pleased that there is renewed
   activity and interest in the matter.

<p><ent type='ORG'>Inslaw Inc</ent>. owners Nancy B. and William A. Hamilton are expecting the worst,
yet hoping for the best out of anew <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> investigation into the
couple's allegations that <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> stole Inslaw software and attempted to
drive the <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> company into bankruptcy.</p>

<p>When the newly designated attorney general, William P. Barr, announced this
month that he had appointed a special counsel to check out the Hamiltons'
claims, Nancy Hamilton expressed doubts about the outcome of such an
investigation.</p>

<p>A special pro<ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>utor appointed outside the department is sorely needed, she
said.  It is unreasonable "to think that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent></ent> could
investigate itself," she said.</p>

<p>For nearly eight years, the Hamiltons have been fighting to get compensation
from <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> for the alleged theft of enhanced versions of the company's case
management software, <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent>.</p>

<p>The U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>Bankruptcy Court</ent> in 1987 found in Inslaw's favor and said <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
had tried to force the company into bankruptcy.  The following year, the U.S.
<ent type='ORG'>District Court</ent> for <ent type='ORG'>the District of Columbia</ent> affirmed the bankruptcy court
ruling and awarded Inslaw $6 million.</p>

<p>But in May, the U.S.  Appeals Court for D.C.  threw out those rulings, saying
the bankruptcy court had exceeded its authority.</p>

<p>Now Barr has asked Nicholas J. Bua, a retired federal judge for the Northern
District of <ent type='GPE'>Illinois</ent>, to "review all the information related to the Inslaw
case and advise the attorney general of any further action that may be
required," <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> spokesman Joseph <ent type='GPE'>Krovisky</ent> said.</p>

<p>Bua, who will serve as special counsel and assistant U.S.  attorney, said he
had "no idea at this time" how long his investigation might take.</p>

<p>Hamilton said she was glad for the renewed interest but questioned whether
Bua could accomplish anything.  <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> employees who know of wrongdoing will
be reluctant to volunteer information because Bua will report directly to
Barr, she said.</p>

<p>"They are not going to tell someone representing the attorney general of the
criminal misconduct of their superior.  It simply won't happen," Hamilton
said.</p>

<p>Barr appointed Bua "in an effort to resolve fairly and conclusively the
ongoing litigation," <ent type='GPE'>Krovisky</ent> said.  Barr gave Bua carte blanche to gather
any information he seeks, <ent type='GPE'>Krovisky</ent> added.</p>

<p>"We are in the embryonic stage of the matter," Bua said, adding that it was
too early to give a reading on the situation.  Bua, a partner in a <ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>
law firm, said he plans to begin looking into the charges in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> by
early December.</p>

<p>Although the appointment is "a step in the right direction," Hamilton said,
she questioned Bua's ability to bring witnesses forward.  "People in law
enforcement know that to uncover official corruption you need subpoena power
and the power of a grand jury," she said.</p>

<p>The special counsel does not have subpoena power now.  But if Bua runs into
problems getting the information he needs, he can "lay out what the problem
is and then request subpoena power from the attorney general," <ent type='GPE'>Krovisky</ent> said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Hamiltons have filed a petition asking <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent></ent> to
consider their case.  "We're hoping that there will be a decision sometime
before the end of the year" on whether <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent></ent> will hear the case,
Hamilton said.</p>

<p>On the congressional front, <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee</ent> still has the
record open on its Inslaw investigation.  The committee has been seeking
several documents from the department.  When Attorney General Richard L.
Thornburgh resigned, several documents relating to Inslaw had not been turned
over.  The committee chairman, Rep.  Jack <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> (D-<ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>), has not said how
he will proceed.</p>

<p>Special Counsel Appointed in Inslaw Case 11/15/91 <ent type='GPE'>WASHINGTON</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>DC</ent>, U.S.A.,
1991 NOV 15 (NB) -- Just a few days after the White <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> suffered a major
public defeat when its hand- picked <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> candidate for <ent type='GPE'>Pennsylvania</ent>, former
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, who had blocked all investigations into
the Inslaw/<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> scandal, was defeated by Harris Wofford,
President Bush's Attorney General-designate, William P. Barr, has appointed a
special counsel to look into charges that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> defrauded
and attempted to bankrupt the Inslaw company.</p>

<p>Allegations surround Inslaw and claims that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> and
intelligence agencies illegally copied, modified, and sold the law
enforcement-related software <ent type='ORG'>PROMIS</ent>, which was marketed by Inslaw.  One
prominent claim is that the software was modified to allow U.S.  intelligence
agencies to penetrate foreign law-enforcement and intelligence computers
running the software through what is called a trap-door, a <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ret way around
the usual password access permission systems used to prevent such access.</p>

<p>Saying during his confirmation hearing testimony before the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent>
Committee on Wednesday, "I want to get to the bottom of this," Mr. Barr went
on to tell the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> that he had appointed retired U.S.  District judge
Nicholas J. Bua (<ent type='GPE'>Chicago</ent>) to investigate the situation which goes back to
1984.  Judge Bua was a <ent type='NORP'>Democrat</ent>ic appointee to the bench.</p>

<p>The U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> of Representatives tried to investigate the Inslaw case last
year when <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee Chairman Jack <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> (D-Tex.) subpoenaed
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> documents which former Attorney General Thornburgh only
grudgingly released early this year.</p>

<p>A court had earlier found <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> guilty of "fraud, deceit,
and trickery" and awarded Inslaw $8 million in damages, but that ruling was
overturned on a minor technicality by another court and the case is now being
put before <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent></ent>.</p>

<p>****WACKENHUT DENIES <ent type='ORG'>INSLAW</ent> CONNECTION 09/24/91 CORAL <ent type='ORG'>GABLES</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>FLORIDA</ent>,
U.S.A., 1991 SEP 24 (NB) -- Wackenhut Corp.'s director of publications,
Patrick Cannan, in a conversation with Newsbytes, has denied any connection
between Wackenhut and the so-called "Inslaw case."</p>

<p>Wackenhut's name has come up consistently in relation to claims made by
Michael Riconosciuto that he, while a research director for a joint venture
between Wackenhut and the <ent type='ORG'>Cabazon</ent> <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Indian</ent>s</ent>, modified a stolen copy of Inslaw's
<ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> software for sale by Earl Brian to the <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> government.  These
claims, which surfaced most recently in a <ent type='ORG'>Village Voice</ent> article by James
Ridgeway ("Software To Die For", <ent type='ORG'>Village Voice</ent>, September 24th), also portray
the joint venture as one which manufactured weapons (including biological and
chemical) for foreign governments, including the "contras."</p>

<p>Cannan told Newsbytes: "When these claims first came up, we did an extensive
check of our records on Riconosciuto and can say, without fear of
contradiction, that he was never an employee of Wackenhut.  I believe that he
did make some proposals to the management of the joint venture and, if they
had been accepted, he would have played a role in the project.  Things like
this are common in this type of business but his proposals were never
accepted."</p>

<p>Cannan, continued, commenting on the relationship of Wackenhut and the
<ent type='ORG'>Cabazon</ent> <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Indian</ent>s</ent>, saying: "We were involved in a joint venture in the early
1980s.  The purpose of the venture was to attempt to obtain contracts in our
base business - the <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity business.  The <ent type='NORP'><ent type='NORP'>Indian</ent>s</ent>, I guess because of their
minority status, were believed to have good opportunities of obtaining this
type of contract.  It turned out that we never got any contracts and, after
two years, the venture was cancelled."</p>

<p>The Inslaw case involves the alleged theft of software by the <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
Deptartment from <ent type='ORG'>the Inslaw Corp</ent>. and, has grown from a tile and bankruptcy
case to one that includes allegations of sales of the software to foreign
governments (such as <ent type='GPE'>Canada</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>South Korea</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Libya</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>) by such
Watergate figures as Robert <ent type='ORG'>McFarlane</ent> and Richard Secord.</p>

<p>The case attracted more public attention following the apparent suicide death
of journalist Joseph D. "Danny" Casolaro on mid-August in a <ent type='GPE'>Martinsburg</ent> motel
room.  Casolaro had told friends that he had made connections between Inslaw,
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent><ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent></ent> and the so-called "October Surprise" (allegations that
representatives of the Reagan-Bush campaign team had convinced the <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>ian</ent>
government to delay release of <ent type='NORP'>American</ent> hostages until after the 1980 U.S.
elections).</p>

<p>Casolaro also allegedly told his brother, that, if he reportedly had an
accident, it was not to be believed.  Former <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> Attorney General Elliot
Richardson, now attorney for Inslaw, has demanded a federal investigation of
Casolaro's death and has been quoted that Inslaw "is far worse than
Watergate."</p>

<p>Cannan also responded to Newsbytes questions concerning rumors that William
Casey, ex-<ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent> Director often named in the "October Surprise" allegations was
legal counsel to Wackenhut before joining the government and that former <ent type='ORG'>CIA</ent>
officials Frank Carlucci and Admiral Bobby Ray <ent type='ORG'>Inman</ent> were Wackenhut
directors.  Cannan said: "Although Casey's law firm represented Wackenhut,
Casey himself never had any connection with us.  Carlucci was a director of
the firm -- he is no longer -- but <ent type='ORG'>Inman</ent> was not.  We did have another
director with a similar background to <ent type='ORG'>Inman</ent>, an admiral who was chief of
naval operations, and that might have lead to the incorrect rumor."</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>The Wackenhut Corp</ent>. is listed on <ent type='ORG'>the New York Stock Exchange</ent> (ticker symbol -
WAK) and is a conglomerate with subsidiaries throughout the world, including
<ent type='GPE'>Canada</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Liberia</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>El Salvador</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Paraguay</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Costa Rica</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Australia</ent>, and Central
Europe.  Its enterprises include the providing of <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity and investigative
services to business, management of correctional facilities, nuclear material
auditing, training of <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity and fire and crash rescue personnel, and the
sale of electronic <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity systems.  It also owns a casualty reinsurance
firm, a travel service and an airline services company.</p>

Title:   As U.S. battles computer company, writer takes vision of evil to
   grave. (the Inslaw case)(Danny Casolaro)
Author:  Ayres, B. Drummond, Jr.</p>

<p>Summary: The mysterious death of Danny Casolaro, a novelist and magazine
   writer, generates attention to the long-running <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent>
   vs <ent type='ORG'>Inslaw Inc</ent> court case.  Inslaw, a small <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> <ent type='GPE'>DC</ent>-based
   software company, has accused <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> officials of
   fraud and theft.  Officials allegedly schemed to steal Inslaw's
   software that was developed for tracking the government's record
   of criminal cases, and withheld payments on the pretext of
   contract violations, thereby driving Inslaw to insolvency.  The
   <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> denies the allegations.  Casolaro, who was
   openly investigating the case, reportedly believed the Inslaw case
   was part of a government-wide scandal involving Reagan
   administration officials.  Inslaw's lawyer, Elliot L. Richardson,
   has called for an investigation on Casolaro's death and the Inslaw
   case.

<p>****CASOLARO SOURCE CHARGES GOV'T PROCUREMENT SCANDAL 08/27/91 <ent type='GPE'>WASHINGTON</ent>,
D.C., U.S.A., 1991 AUG 27 (NB) -- "Bill," the mysterious Newsbytes source who
met with investigative journalist James D. "Danny" Casolaro on the night
before Casolaro's death in a <ent type='GPE'>Martinsburg</ent>, W. <ent type='GPE'>VA</ent> motel, has come forward on
the August 26th "Inside Edition" television show and discussed his meeting
with Casolaro.</p>

<p>By coming forward, "Bill" identified himself as William Turner, a former
quality assurance manager for <ent type='ORG'>Hughes Aircraft</ent>.  In Turner's previous
interviews with Newsbytes, he had requested anonymity because of both a
commitment to Inside Edition and what he said was the advice of counsel.
Turner has alleged that <ent type='ORG'>Hughes Aircraft</ent>, with the assistance of U.S.
government personnel, has covered up the deliverance of systems for military
use that were below the procurement specifications.</p>

<p>While Turner's participation on the television broadcast dealt almost
exclusively with his meeting with Casolaro, he told Newsbytes that he had
over three hours of discussion with the show's interviewers on all aspects of
his charges.  Casolaro has told Newsbytes that his attempts to call public
attention to what he calls a "procurement scandal" have resulted in his
harassment by the government.  He claims that "all of a sudden <ent type='ORG'>the Veteran</ent>'s
Administration found that it had been overpaying my pension.  Even after I
agreed with them on a schedule for me to make installment repayment of the
overage, I was sued for the entire amount."</p>

<p>Turner also told Newsbytes that threats have been made against him
personally, resulting in his obtaining of police protection.  He said that,
prior to the police protection, his house had been under obvious surveillance
from autos parked near his home.  He said that his phone frequently rings
and, when he picks it up, there is an audible "hang-up" from the other end.
He also alleges that his telephone is "tapped" and that his conversations are
often interrupted by clicks and that conversations are terminated.</p>

<p>During his conversation with Newsbytes, at a point when he was discussing the
details of the alleged procurement scandal, a click similar to that of an
extension being picked up was clearly heard and our conversation was cut off.
When Newsbytes called back, Turner said that the interruption had become an
"on-going thing" and that he was "sure that it related to his phone being
tapped."</p>

<p>Turner said that he has had contact with ex-U.S.  Attorney General Elliott
Richardson's law firm, which is also representing <ent type='ORG'>Inslaw Inc</ent>., the firm whose
charges against the <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> Dept.  has been a major subject of Casolaro's
investigation.  According to Turner, the law firm has advised him to refuse
to discuss the Casolaro death with the <ent type='GPE'>Martinsburg</ent>, W. <ent type='GPE'>VA</ent> police who have
been trying to contact him.  Turner, who criticized the police investigation
of the death, said that he will discuss his meeting with Casolaro with the
police when his attorneys are present.</p>

<p>Turner told Newsbytes that on the day before Casolaro was found dead of an
apparent suicide, he had met with him and turned over papers documenting his
charges about the Hughes cover-up.  He said that he was shown other material
that Casolaro had received -- material that Casolaro felt would substantiate
"Octopus" theory.  (According to friends of Casolaro, "octopus" referred to
his belief that there was a connection between the various cases, or
"tentacles," that he was investigating: Inslaw, government procurement,
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent><ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent></ent>, "October Surprise.")</p>

<p>Reports from the <ent type='GPE'>Martinsburg</ent> death scene did not report the finding of papers
mentioned by Turner and their absence has led to charges that Casolaro met
with foul play.  Richardson has called for a federal investigation of the
death, as has Casolaro's brother, a <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> physician.</p>

<p>Turner also told Newsbytes that he has additional copies of the documentation
supporting his charges <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ure in a safe place and that the "truth will come
out even if something happens to me."</p>

<p>The so-called "Inslaw Case" involves charges by Inslaw, Inc. that the <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> purposely drove it into bankruptcy so that it could steal Inslaw's
<ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> software.  While bankruptcy counts on two decisions found the
allegations to be factual and fined the <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> Dept., saying that the
government agency had practiced "trickery, fraud and deceit," the U.S.  Court
of Appeals on May 7, 1991 overturned the award, saying that the courts had
overstepped their jurisdiction.  The appeals court said, at the time, that
Inslaw CEO William Hamilton was free to pursue his claims in the proper
federal court and that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent>'s "conduct, if it occurred, is
inexcusable."</p>

<p>During the appeal process, Inslaw broadened its charges to claim that <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent> figures Robert <ent type='ORG'>McFarlane</ent> and Richard Secord had played a role is
disseminating the software to intelligence agencies of <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Libya</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>South Korea</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Canada</ent>.  These charges, substantiated by Ari Ben-Menashe,
who claims to be a former <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>i intelligence officer, <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>ian</ent> arms dealer
Richard Babayan, and Michael Riconosciuto, who said that he was hired to
modify the software for use in law enforcement and intelligence agencies
worldwide, led to a investigation of the case by the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent>
Committee and a confrontation between committee chairman Jack <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> and
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh over the release to the committee of
material relating to the case.  The investigation continues at this time.</p>

<p>Turner told Newsbytes that he has confidence in Casolaro's theory of a
connection between Inslaw and his charges concerning Hughes.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>INSLAW</ent> "SOURCE" SPEAKS TO NEWSBYTES 08/22/91 <ent type='GPE'>WASHINGTON</ent>, D.C., U.S.A., 1991
AUG 22 (NB) -- "Bill," the person who reportedly met with journalist James D.
"Danny" Casolaro on the night before Casolaro's death in a <ent type='GPE'>Martinsburg</ent>, W. <ent type='GPE'>VA</ent>
motel, has confirmed to Newsbytes that he provided Casolaro with evidence of
U.S.  government malfeasance in the procurement of technology.</p>

<p>Bill, speaking to Newsbytes under the promise of anonymity, said that
Casolaro found this information to be related to Casolaro's year- long
investigation of accusations made by the Inslaw, Inc. against the United
States <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>.  Casolaro had told friends shortly before his
death that he had taken to calling the investigation the "Octopus" because of
connections that he had allegedly found between the Inslaw case and such
things as "<ent type='ORG'><ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent><ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent></ent>," the "October Surprise," investigation and Bill's
charges.</p>

<p>Bill, who is now scheduled to "go public" with his charges in an appearance
on the television show "Inside Edition" on Monday, August 26th, told
Newsbytes that he had promised the producers of the show that he would make
no statements to the media on these matters until Tuesday, August 27th.  He
additionally said that he had discussed this commitment with Inslaw, Inc.
attorney Elliot Richardson who also advised him to make no public statements
until that date.</p>

<p>Bill further told Newsbytes that the <ent type='GPE'>Martinsburg</ent> police investigators are
aware of his identity and have attempted to interrogate him concerning his
conversations with Casolaro.  He, to this date, has refused to meet with them
and stated that this decision was also made in consultation with Richardson's
firm.  He also told Newsbytes that he has reason to believe that he is under
surveillance, saying, "There are many more cars on my street than usual and I
am sure that my phone is tapped.  I'm getting calls at all hours of the night
and, when I pick up the phone, the caller hangs up.  They are not only
watching me but are trying to scare me off.  They won't succeed, however; I
will get the truth out.  I have copies of the documentation in a safe place
and it will come out even if something happens to me."</p>

<p>Another Inslaw-related allegation came to light when a Newsbytes source said
that Casolaro had told her/him that a person that was about to furnish him
with important documentation had been murdered last January 31st.  According
to the source, Casolaro had identified ex-<ent type='ORG'>National Security Agency</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>)
employee Alan David <ent type='ORG'>Standoff</ent>, found at <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> National Airport in a car,
as a contact tied to the case.  According to investigators, <ent type='ORG'>Standoff</ent> had been
murdered by beating with a blunt instrument at some other location and then
transported to the airport.  He, according to the Newsbytes source, had
resigned from the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent> on December 19th (effective 01/14/91) because of his
call-up by his <ent type='ORG'>National Guard</ent> unit.</p>

<p>Casolaro's death, initially ruled a suicide, has been referred to as possibly
a murder by friends and relatives as well as by Richardson who has called for
a federal inquiry.  The so-called "Inslaw Case" involves charges by Inslaw,
Inc., that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> purposely drove it into bankruptcy so that
it could steal Inslaw's <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> software.  While bankruptcy counts on two
decisions found the allegations to be factual and fined the <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> Dept.,
saying that the government agency had practiced "trickery, fraud and deceit."
The U.S.  Court of Appeals on May 7, 1991 overturned the award, saying that
the courts had overstepped their jurisdiction.  The appeals court said, at
the time, that Inslaw CEO William Hamilton was free to pursue his claims in
the proper federal court and that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent>'s "conduct, if it
occurred, is inexcusable."</p>

<p>During the appeal process, Inslaw broadened its charges to claim that <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent> figures Robert <ent type='ORG'>McFarlane</ent> and Richard Secord had played a role is
disseminating the software to intelligence agencies of <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Libya</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>South Korea</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Canada</ent>.  These charges, substantiated by Ari Ben-Menashe,
who claims to be a former <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>i intelligence officer, <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>ian</ent> arms dealer
Richard Babayan, and Michael Riconosciuto, who said that he was hired to
modify the software for use in law enforcement and intelligence agencies
worldwide, led to a investigation of the case by the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent>
Committee and a confrontation between committee chairman Jack <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> and
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh over the release to the committee of
material relating to the case.  The investigation continues at this time.</p>

<p>****<ent type='ORG'>INSLAW</ent> DEATH INVESTIGATION CONTINUES 08/19/91 <ent type='ORG'>MARTINSBURG</ent>, WEST VIRGINIA,
U.S.A., AUG 19 (NB) -- The <ent type='ORG'>Sheraton</ent> Inn in <ent type='GPE'>Martinsburg</ent>, West <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent>, the
scene of the death of <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, D.C.  journalist Joseph D. "Danny"
Casolaro, has received more press attention than ever before in its history
as reporters from ABC-TV, <ent type='ORG'>Newsbytes News Network</ent>, and the <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Post</ent>
roamed the halls interrogating bell-hops, waitresses, and desk clerks for
information regarding the death of Casolaro.</p>

<p>Employees, supposedly under the cloak of <ent type='ORG'>Sheraton</ent>-forced silence, told
Newsbytes that, while some prospective guests have specifically requested the
room in which Casolaro died, their instructions have been to leave the room
vacant for an unspecified time.</p>

<p>Casolaro, 44, had been investigating the "Inslaw" case, a rather tangled web
of allegations relating to the charges brought by <ent type='ORG'>Inslaw Inc</ent>., that the
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> had first stolen its software product, "<ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent>," and then
driven the firm into bankruptcy.  Casolaro had told friends and family that
he was about to receive material that would provide him with documentation
linking Inslaw to other alleged incidents of Reagan-Bush administration
wrong-doing.  Casolaro was said to have referred to the alleged conspiracy as
the "Octopus" and stated that there were links between the Inslaw theft, the
"October Surprise," and <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>- <ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent> allegations.</p>

<p>The "October surprise" refers to allegations that representatives of the
Reagan-Bush campaign team, through meetings with <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>ian</ent> representatives,
delayed the release of the hostages in <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent> until after the 1980 elections.
These charges are currently being investigated by <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>ional committee.</p>

<p>Casolaro was found dead, an apparent suicide, in Room 517 of the <ent type='ORG'>Sheraton</ent> on
Saturday, August 10th, two days after his arrival in <ent type='GPE'>Martinsburg</ent>.  He was
found in the bathtub at approximately 1:00 pm with both wrists slashed.  His
body was released within three hours to a local funeral parlor for embalming,
an action that <ent type='ORG'><ent type='GPE'>Berkeley County</ent> Medical</ent> Examiner Sandra Brining was quoted as
saying was normal in the case of a suicide.  "Everything was consistent with
a self-inflicted wound."</p>

<p>When Casolaro's family became aware of his death on Monday, August 14th, it
immediately called for an expanded investigation and his brother, Dr. Anthony
Casolaro, an <ent type='GPE'>Arlington</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> physician, was quoted as saying, "In my
heart I remember Danny telling us that in case of an accident, don't believe
it." Dr. Casolaro also discounted statements made by his brother in a letter
to a publisher in which he seemed financially strapped and despondent.  Dr.
Casolaro attributed Casolaro's remarks to a desire to convince the would-be
publisher of the importance of extending a book contract to him.  Casolaro
had been immersed in the Inslaw case for over a year and had been
unsuccessful in two proposals to the publishing firm of Little, Brown &amp; Co.</p>

<p>The clamor for a fuller investigation caused an autopsy to be subsequently
performed on Casolaro, an action that Assistant <ent type='GPE'>Berkeley County</ent> pro<ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>utor
Cynthia Gaither said was not hindered by the previous embalming.</p>

<p>Casolaro was buried on Friday, October 16th after a funeral service at St.
Ann's Catholic Church in <ent type='GPE'>Arlington</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> attended by over 100 people.</p>

<p>At a press conference held on Thursday, August 15th, Dr. James Frost,
assistant West <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> medical <ent type='ORG'>examiner</ent>, said that, while the results of the
examination bore out the preliminary findings of suicide, the investigation
would be continued.  Brining and Gaither also participated in the hour-long
press conference held in the meeting room of the <ent type='GPE'>Martinsburg</ent> City Council.</p>

<p>Newsbytes has obtained conflicting reports on the state of Casolaro's mental
condition.  A <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> free-lance journalist, <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> <ent type='ORG'>McCullough</ent>, with
whom Casolaro had allegedly shared information, told Newsbytes, "It is
ludicrous to think that Danny took his life.  He was excited about his new
contact and said that 'For the first time I really believe that the
government was involved.'" <ent type='ORG'>McCullough</ent>, herself, claims to be the victim of a
government action that drove her electronics firm into bankruptcy and she is
presently writing a book on her case and other similar cases, including
Inslaw.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>McCullough</ent>'s comments on the unlikelihood of a Casolaro suicide were echoed
in quotes from Pat Clawson, president of <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>- based Metrowest
Broadcasting Co., and Richard O'<ent type='ORG'>Connell</ent>, editor of the <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> Crime News,
a newsletter published in <ent type='GPE'>Arlington</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>VA</ent>.  Nancy Hamilton, vice president of
Inslaw, also took issue with the suicide finding telling the <ent type='GPE'>Martinsburg</ent>
Morning Journal, "We don't accept that.  They are saying that here is a man,
totally sober, mutilating himself."</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>Martinsburg</ent> residents interviewed by Newsbytes paint a slightly different
picture and depict Casolaro as seemingly depressed and drinking pitchers of
beer by himself in a local <ent type='ORG'>Pizza Hut</ent> on the Thursday evening before his death
(although a wine bottle was found in his room, there was no evidence of
alcohol found in the body by the autopsy).  Additionally, a <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Post</ent>
piece of Saturday, August 17th by Gary Lee and Robert O'Harrow, Jr., shows
Casolaro to be debt-ridden and despondent.  According to the <ent type='ORG'>Post</ent> report,
"Casolaro had no independent means of income and had invested heavily in the
book project for at least eight months, financing several trips to the West
Coast and long-distance telephone calls."</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>Post</ent> article also revealed that Casolaro's sister had committed suicide
in <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> 20 years ago.  While confirming the sister's suicide and his
brother's financial difficulties, Dr. Casolaro said that these facts still
did not support a conclusion of suicide for his brother.  He told the <ent type='ORG'>Post</ent>,
"Danny was the sort of guy who was always broke but he knew that he had a lot
of resources for money in the family if he needed it."</p>

<p>Dr.  Casolaro also told the <ent type='ORG'>Post</ent> that he had received a call from a man who
purported to have met with Casolaro in <ent type='GPE'>Martinsburg</ent> on the day before the
death and turned over documents relating to computer hardware thefts.  Dr.
Casolaro said that the man was willing to meet with investigators under the
cloak of anonymity.  Newsbytes has confirmed, from multiple sources, the
existence of the contact, a man called "Bill," but has not yet obtained
information concerning the content or the validity of the purported
documentation.</p>

<p>The so-called "Inslaw Case" began in 1982 when Inslaw signed a $10 million
contract to provide an enhanced version of its case tracking software to the
U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>.  According to Inslaw, shortly after it rebuffed
attempts by a company owned by Earl Brian, a close friend of former <ent type='GPE'>US</ent>.
Attorney General Edwin Meese, to buy Inslaw, the government stopped its
contract payments and eventually forced the firm into bankruptcy.  In January
1988, a federal bankruptcy judge upheld the claims of Inslaw President
William Hamilton and awarded Inslaw damages of $6.8 million, saying that the
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> has stolen the <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> software by "trickery, fraud and
deceit." A <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ond federal judge later upheld the ruling.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> Dept.  continued to appeal the verdicts and, on May 7, 1991, was
successful when the U.S.  Court of Appeals ruled that the bankruptcy court
had claimed extraordinary and improper jurisdiction in the case.  The court
said that Hamilton was free to pursue his claims in the proper federal court
and that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent>'s "conduct, if it occurred, is inexcusable."</p>

<p>During the appeal process, Inslaw broadened its charges to claim that <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent> figures Robert <ent type='ORG'>McFarlane</ent> and Richard Secord had played a role is
disseminating the software to intelligence agencies of <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Libya</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>,
<ent type='GPE'>South Korea</ent>, and <ent type='GPE'>Canada</ent>.  These charges were substantiated by Ari
Ben-Menashe, who claims to be a former <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>i intelligence officer, <ent type='NORP'><ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>ian</ent>
arms dealer Richard Babayan, and Michael Riconosciuto, who said that he was
hired to modify the software for use in law enforcement and intelligence
agencies worldwide.</p>

<p>Riconosciuto, who was arrested in March of this year and is being held in the
state of <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>, also claimed to be involved in a now-defunct joint
venture between the Wachenhut Corp. of Coral Gables, FL and the <ent type='NORP'>Southern</ent>
<ent type='GPE'>California</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Cabazon</ent> <ent type='NORP'>Indian</ent> tribe.  According to Riconosciuto's affidavit, the
joint venture developed sophisticated weapons for the <ent type='ORG'>Contra</ent>s.  <ent type='ORG'>McFarlane</ent> and
Brian have denied all charges.</p>

<p>There have also been reports that the software, allegedly used by the foreign
intelligence services for maintaining dissidents, contained a "Trojan horse"
that would allow U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity agencies to have undetected access to the
computer system of the foreign agency.  It was also revealed during this time
that Inslaw President Hamilton is a former employee of the National Security
Agency (<ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>).</p>

<p>As the long appeal process continued, <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee</ent> under
Chairman Jack <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> (D-Tex.) began its own investigation of the case and
became embroiled in a year-long battle with then Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh who refused to turn over <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> documents to the
committee.  Shortly before Thornburgh's departure to run for the <ent type='ORG'>Senate</ent> from
<ent type='GPE'>Pennsylvania</ent>, an agreement was reached between the committee and the <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> on the release of certain documents and the investigation is now
continuing.  During the controversy, another former U.S.  Attorney General,
Elliot Richardson, now serving as counsel for Inslaw, said, "Evidence of the
widespread ramifications of the Inslaw case comes from many sources and keeps
accumulating.  It remains inexplicable why <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> refuses to
pursue this evidence and resists cooperation with <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee</ent> of
the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> of Representatives."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, August 14th, Richardson called for a federal investigation of
Casolaro's death and was quoted as suspecting murder in the case.</p>

<p>In an interview with Newsbytes, an investigative reporter who has been
tracking Inslaw and related cases for a few years said that he had met with
Casolaro within the last six months and that Casolaro had no material at that
time that the investigative reporter deemed as new.  The reporter, speaking
to Newsbytes under the promise of non-attribution, also said, "I believe that
<ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> stole Inslaw's software.  I have not seen, however,
compelling evidence to support the charges that it was linked to the
so-called 'October Surprise.'"</p>

<p>Remember the <ent type='ORG'>InsLaw Inc</ent> case - well it looks set to blow up into a high

company that was awarded a $10m contract with the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> for
software designed to make it easier for the police and the authorities to
track cases and keep tabs on dissidents, and in 1983, it sued <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
claiming that theer ain't no such thing and that the <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> had stolen
its software; a <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> of Representatives judiciary subcommittee is still
investigating the case, but meantime Joseph Casolaro, an investigative
reporter of <ent type='GPE'>Fairfax</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> who had been working for a year researching a
book on the InsLaw case, was found in a hotel bathtub with both wrists
slashed; a suicide note was found nearby, but an autopsy has been ordered

<p>"SUICIDE" OF <ent type='ORG'>INSLAW</ent> REPORTER QUESTIONED 08/15/91 <ent type='ORG'>SUNOL</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>CALIFORNIA</ent>, U.S.A.,
1991 AUG 15 (NB) -- The verdict of suicide in the death of reporter Joseph D.
"Danny" Casolaro on Saturday, August 10th has been challenged by friends and
relatives.</p>

<p>Casolaro, 44, of <ent type='GPE'>Fairfax</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Va</ent>., had been, according to reports, involved in an
investigation of the allegations surrounding government activities in the
Inslaw software case.</p>

<p>Casolaro was, according to reports, found dead in the bathtub of his
<ent type='GPE'>Martinsburg</ent>, West <ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> hotel room Saturday with his wrists cut.  Dr.
James Frost, an assistant state medical <ent type='ORG'>examiner</ent> was quoted as saying: "The
wounds are consistent with being self- inflicted, but that doesn't mean that
someone else couldn't have done this if he were not able to defend himself."</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>Virginia</ent> <ent type='ORG'>McCullough</ent>, a freelance journalist and friend of Casolaro, told
Newsbytes that Casolaro was working for over a year on a book concerning the
allegations by Inslaw president William Hamilton that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent>
first broke a $10 million contract with his firm, then stole the firm's
software and subsequently sold and donated it to foreign intelligence
agencies.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>McCullough</ent> said: "It is ludicrous to think that Danny would kill himself.  He
had recently told me that he was looking forward to a trip that would give
him the documentation to prove <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent>'s involvement.  He
said: 'For the first time, I've become a real believer that the government
was involved in these things.'"</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>McCullough</ent> went on to say that Casolaro was never depressed in his
conversations with her and that they often spoke, sharing information in
relation to the case.  <ent type='ORG'>McCullough</ent>, herself involved with a company that she
says had very similar experiences to Inslaw, is currently writing a book
detailing what she says have been questionable acts by government agencies in
the use of bankruptcy proceedings to stifle the development of technology.</p>

<p>Casolaro's brother, Dr. M. Anthony Casolaro, was quoted by news services as
also doubting the suicide reports.  He said that police told him a
handwritten note saying: "I'm sorry, especially to my son," was found at the
scene.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee is presently investigating the Inslaw charges
and had announced in April of this year that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent>, after
long delays, has agreed to turn over documentation relating to the case.</p>

<p>The case began in 1985 when Inslaw filed for bankruptcy claiming that the
<ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> Dept.  had stopped payment on a 1982 contract for the installation of
Inslaw's legal case management software, "<ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent>" into 97 U.S.  Attorney's
offices.  Inslaw claimed that the government contract represented 70 percent
of Inslaw's income and that the government action forced it into bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Inslaw was successful and a bankruptcy judge found that the department "took,
converted and stole" the company's property "by trickery, fraud and deceit"
and further said that the government's conduct demonstrated "bad faith,
vexatiousness, wantonness and oppressiveness."</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> appealed the ruling and, in 1989, U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>District Court</ent>
Judge William Bryant upheld the decision and ordered the government to pay
Inslaw $8 million plus attorney's fees.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> continued to appeal the case and, on May 7, 1991, was
successful when the U.S.  Court of Appeals for <ent type='ORG'>the District of Columbia</ent>
reversed the bankruptcy rulings saying that the bankruptcy court's rulings
were too broad and inappropriate for a bankruptcy ruling.</p>

<p>The court said that, while Inslaw is entitled to go to another court to press
its claim,.  the U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>Bankruptcy Court</ent> lacked jurisdiction.  Commenting on
Inslaw's allegations of misbehavior, the court said: "Such conduct, if it
occurred, is inexcusable."</p>

<p>During the appeals, stories of illegal sales of the allegedly stolen software
to foreign governments including <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Libya</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>South Korea</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Canada</ent>,
and involvement of Reagan <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> appointees Earl Brian,
Robert <ent type='ORG'>McFarlane</ent> and Richard Secord in the transactions have caused the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee to seek involvement -- an involvement that the <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> has resisted.</p>

<p>Elliot Richardson, former <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent> Attorney General who now represents
Hamilton, was quoted during the appeal process as saying: "Evidence of the
widespread ramifications of the Inslaw case comes from many sources and keeps
accumulating."</p>

<p>"It remains inexplicable why <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> consistently refuses to
pursue this evidence and resists co-operation with <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee</ent> of
the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> of Representatives," he added.</p>

<p>The case took still another turn when witness Ari Ben-Menashe reportedly
testified that the owner of Inslaw, William Hamilton, is a former employee of
the <ent type='ORG'>National Security Agency</ent> (<ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent>) and that the software was modified into a
"Trojan Horse" in order to allow the <ent type='ORG'>NSA</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>Mossad</ent> to listen in on the
transactions of other intelligence services.</p>

<p>The attraction of the case management software to these intelligence agencies
was, according to witnesses, that, rather than its intended use of tracking
case witnesses and legal opinions, it lent itself to the tracking of
dissidents and foreign agents.</p>

<p>Threatened with a contempt-of-<ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> charge, Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh last week turned over to <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> investigators several hundred
subpoenaed documents concerning <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent>'s dealings with Inslaw
Inc.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday night, Thornburgh handed over most but not all of the 456
documents.  Rep.  Jack <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> (D-<ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>), chairman of the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent>
Committee, had warned that if the department failed to hand over the
documents by Wednesday, he would ask <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> to act to hold Thornburgh in
contempt.</p>

<p>After the partial delivery, <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> said the contempt proceedings were "merely
suspended."  He said he expects Thornburgh to turn over the remaining
documents by Sept. 11, when <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent> reconvenes after its summer holiday.</p>

<p>The missing documents are from one file of the chief litigating attorney in
the Inslaw case.  <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> officials have been telling the committee since May
that the department had misplaced 51 of that attorney's documents.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> reconstructed most of these documents, but at least 12 still are
missing, <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> said, adding that the committee has not been able to assess
the thoroughness of the reconstructed material.  Also, <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> said, at least
another 40 documents submitted last week are incomplete.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> said in a letter that it had searched "meticulously" for the missing
documents.  <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> said the department has been unable to explain to the
committee how the records were misplaced.</p>

<p>"By the department's own admission, these documents are highly sensitive.  I
hope they are not lost somewhere," he said last week.  "I remain concerned
that no action has been taken [by the department] to investigate the
possibility that this material was destroyed, stolen or shredded in order to
obstruct the committee's investigation."</p>

<p>For the past several years, <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> and Inslaw, a small <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> software
company, have been battling in courts over the company's case management
software, <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent>.  Inslaw first provided its software to <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> through a
1982 contract.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent>' committee has been investigating allegations that <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> stole later
versions of the software and tried to force the company into bankruptcy.  But
<ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> said Thornburgh has stalled <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent>'s two-year investigation by
denying committee investigators access to documents.</p>

<p>Finally, late last month, the <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Subcommittee on Economic and
Commercial Law voted 10 to 6 to subpoena the Inslaw files from Thornburgh.</p>

<p>Although the department had promised repeatedly to supply the missing
documents, <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> said, the subpoena was necessary because <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> had
reneged at least three times.</p>

<p>"At this rate, the investigation could drag on for another two years," <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent>
said.  "I simply cannot permit legitimate oversight to be forestalled by
dilatory or evasive steps."</p>

<p>To hold Thornburgh in contempt of <ent type='ORG'>Congress</ent>, <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> would have to gain the
votes of a majority of the full <ent type='ORG'>House</ent>.  If the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> were to approve such a
charge, theoretically the sergeant-at-arms would be empowered to arrest the
attorney general and hold him in a one-room cell in the Capitol.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> officials tried to avoid the subpoena by making an 11th-hour promise
last month to provide the documents.  <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> said Thornburgh had assured him
on six occasions that the department would cooperate.  But <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> said he no
longer would accept such assurances, and the subcommittee went ahead with the
subpoena.</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee's relationship with Thornburgh has grown increasingly
testly during the past few weeks, culminating with the Inslaw subpoena.</p>

<p>Thornburgh refused to appear at an earlier committee hearing concerning
<ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>'s 1992 budget request [<ent type='ORG'>GCN</ent>, July 22].  <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> has said the committee
may cut finding for several <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> programs, including its massive Project
<ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent> office automation initiative, if that is what is necessary to get the
department's attention.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the U.S.  Court of Appeals for <ent type='ORG'>the District of Columbia</ent> has denied
Inslaw's petition for a rehearing by the 11-judge bench.</p>

<p>An appeals court panel in May ruled that the U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>Bankruptcy Court</ent> did not
have jurisdiction in 1988 when it concluded that <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> attempted to drive
Inslaw out of business.</p>

<p>Nancy Hamilton, Inslaw vice president, said the company plans to petition the
<ent type='ORG'>Supreme Court</ent> to hear its case.</p>

<p>Summary: The <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> of Representatives <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee issued a
   subpoena to the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> to turn over records thought

<p><ent type='ORG'>Inslaw Inc</ent>. has asked the 11-judge bench of the U.S.  Court of Appeals for
<ent type='ORG'>the District of Columbia</ent> to reinstate a lower court's decision to award
Inslaw $6 million in damages from <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent>.</p>

<p>For several years, the small <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> software company has alleged that
following a dispute over a 1982 contract, <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> officials tried to force
Inslaw into bankruptcy and to steal enhanced versions of the company's case
management software, <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent>.</p>

<p>In 1987, the U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>Bankruptcy Court</ent> substantially upheld these arguments.
The U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>District Court</ent> in <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> then affirmed the bankruptcy court's
ruling and awarded Inslaw more than $6 million in damages, which <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
never paid.</p>

<p>An appeals court panel in May said the bankruptcy court had no jurisdiction
to rule that <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> used "trickery, fraud and deceit" to drive Inslaw out of
business.</p>

<p>Inslaw's petition for reconsideration said the appeals court decision
"rejects the well-accepted authority of a bankruptcy court to hear actions
that directly affect the administration of a bankruptcy estate."</p>

<p>In reversing the ruling, the appeals court said it was not ruling on the
validity of Inslaw's allegations and suggested the company file its
complaints anew in a court other than bankruptcy court.</p>

<p>Summary: A federal appeals court has dismissed the ruling of a lower court
   that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent></ent> stole case management software from
   <ent type='ORG'>Inslaw Inc</ent>. The District of Columbia <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> Court of Appeals ruled
   that the federal <ent type='ORG'>Bankruptcy Court</ent> overstepped its jurisdiction in
   1987 when it ruled that <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> used fraud,
   trickery and deceit to force the <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>-based software company

   ruling and awarded Inslaw a $6 million judgement which the <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
   <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> never paid.  The appeals court suggested that Inslaw
   start over in the federal court system after five years of legal
   actions stemming from a contract awarded by <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> to Inslaw for
   the development of case management software.  The court's decision
   said <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> was brought into the Bankruptcy court
   because Inslaw filed for bankruptcy and the company succeeded in
   convincing the court to adjudicate the contract, though the court
   had no jurisdiction to do so.  The court did not rule on the

Full Text:</p>

<p>A federal appeals court last week threw out a lower court's findings that the
<ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> had stolen case management software from <ent type='ORG'>Inslaw Inc</ent>.</p>

<p>The U.S.  Court of Appeals for <ent type='ORG'>the District of Columbia</ent> found that the U.S.
<ent type='ORG'>Bankruptcy Court</ent> had overstepped its jurisdiction in 1987 when it ruled
<ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> used "trickery, fraud and deceit" to drive the small <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>
software company out of business.</p>

<p>A U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>District Court</ent> later affirmed the bankruptcy ruling and awarded
Inslaw $6 million.  <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> never paid the money.</p>

<p>After five years of legal actions stemming from a contract <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> awarded to
Inslaw in 1982 for development of case management software, the appeals court
suggested that Inslaw start over in the federal court system.</p>

<p>The appeals court's decision said <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> was "hauled in front of the
bankruptcy court simply because Inslaw filed for bankruptcy, and Inslaw has
succeeded in convincing the bankruptcy court to adjudicate its contract .  .
.  disputes although the court had no basis to do so."</p>

<p>The court did not rule on the validity of the Inslaw charges and criticized
the bankruptcy court for its "extraordinary" ruling.  "Such conduct, if it
occurred, is inexcusable," the appeals court said of Inslaw's complaints
against <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>.  But, "offensive as lawless conduct by one branch of
government may be, however, it does not justify another's lawlessness."</p>

<p>The reversal also means <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> need not comply with a discovery ruling last
month in which an appeals court judge ordered <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> to turn over
information about whether the software, <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent>, was being used at several
<ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> bureaus.</p>

<p>Inslaw vice president Nancy Hamilton said the company "will fight to the
end."  She said Inslaw either will file a new suit or appeal the decision.
The company has gathered more evidence against <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> since it filed the
original suit, she said.</p>

<p>Stuart M. Gerson, assistant attorney general in charge of <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>'s Civil
Division, said the department was "gratified" by the court's dismissal of
Inslaw's complaint.</p>

<p>Gerson said it "vindicates the position the government has taken from the
outset -- that notwithstanding the intensity of the underlying dispute
between Inslaw and the department, this is fundamentally a .  .  .
contractual disagreement."</p>

<p>Inslaw president William A. Hamilton said, "The <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> has
consistently hidden behind technical defenses to avoid its duty to enforce
the laws in regard to the misconduct of its own officials against Inslaw."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a congressional investigation of the Inslaw-<ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> dispute is
continuing.  After months of stalling, Attorney General Richard Thornburgh
has agreed to make several hundred documents about the department's dealings
with Inslaw available to <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee investigators.</p>

<p>The committee was allowed access to the materials only after agreeing to
several stipulations Thornburgh laid out last month in a letter to the
committee chairman, Rep.  Jack <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> (D-<ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>).</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> investigators agreed to review the documents on <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>'s premises,
formally request copies and, at least initially, withhold the documents from
the public.</p>

<p>Since last July, <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> had been trying to obtain some 200 department
documents his committee investigators said pertained to the legal dispute.</p>

<p>It now appears the committee will examine many more than 200 documents.  The
first of 15 sets of documents, which investigators began reviewing May 1,
alone contained 193 items.</p>

<p>The committee considers access to the documents a major breakthrough in its
investigation.</p>

<p>The issue of access to the documents came to a head late last year.  <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent>,
frustrated by <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>'s continual delays in providing the materials to his
committee, threatened to issue subpoenas and said he would use whatever means
necessary to force <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> to turn over the documents.</p>

<p>Subsequently, Thornburgh assured <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> he would give him the documents and
the department would cooperate fully.</p>

<p><ent type='GPE'>WASHINGTON</ent> POST CALLS FOR <ent type='ORG'>INSLAW</ent> PROGRESS 04/29/91 <ent type='GPE'>WASHINGTON</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>DC</ent>, U.S.A.,
1991 APR 29 (NB) -- The <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Post</ent>, in an April 27th editorial, has
criticized <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> for the lengthy lack of progress in
cooperation with <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee</ent>'s investigation of the Inslaw
case.</p>

<p>Recalling that it had editorially praised Attorney General Dick Thornburgh a
year ago for agreeing to cooperate, the <ent type='ORG'>Post</ent> said, "We wrote too soon.  The
department continued to resist the committee's request for some documents,
and the investigation has been hamstrung while lawyers argued over what
should be shared and what should remain <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ret.  This week agreement was
finally achieved - or so we think - and after seven years of stonewalling the
department has pledged full cooperation."</p>

<p>Inslaw, a small computer software firm signed a contract in 1982 to supply
all 94 U.S.  attorney's offices with "<ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent>" software it had developed to
track the progress of cases and compile information about caseloads.
According to the <ent type='ORG'>Post</ent> story, the government contract accounted for 70% of
Inslaw's business and, when the <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> Dept.  stopped payment and terminated
the contract in 1984, the firm went into bankruptcy.</p>

<p>William Hamilton, Inslaw owner, brought suit against the <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> Dept.,
claiming that it had stolen the firm's software and willfully driven the firm
into bankruptcy.  Hamilton was successful in his suit and a judge in the
initial case found that the department "took, converted and stole" the
company's property "by trickery, fraud and deceit" and further said that the
government's conduct demonstrated "bad faith, vexatiousness, wantonness and
oppressiveness."</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> Dept.  appealed the ruling and, in 1989, U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>District Court</ent>
Judge William Bryant upheld the decision and ordered the government to pay
Inslaw $8 million plus attorney's fees.  Bryant's decision has since been
appealed.</p>

<p>During the appeals, stories of illegal sales of the allegedly stolen software
to foreign governments including <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Libya</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>South Korea</ent>, <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>Canada</ent>,
and involvement of Reagan <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> and <ent type='GPE'>California</ent> appointees Earl Brian,
Robert <ent type='ORG'>McFarlane</ent> and Richard Secord in the transactions have caused the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent>
<ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee to seek involvement -- an involvement that the <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
Dept.  has resisted.  Elliot Richardson, former <ent type='GPE'>United States</ent> Attorney
General who now represents Hamilton, was quoted recently as saying, "Evidence
of the widespread ramifications of the Inslaw case comes from many sources
and keeps accumulating.  It remains inexplicable why <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent>
consistently refuses to pursue this evidence and resists cooperation with the
<ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee of the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> of Representatives."</p>

<p>The <ent type='ORG'>Post</ent> editorial concludes, "The <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee has been more
insistent, and now Chairman Jack <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent>' (D-Tex.) persistence has paid off.
The attorney general will let committee investigators see every document,
though it is understood that some material sensitive to the litigation will
be treated in confidence.  This simple arrangement should not have taken
nearly so long.  The breakthrough is welcome.  We hope it is for real this
time."</p>

<p>Panel Questions <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> Dept.  on Inslaw</p>

<p>Despite <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent>'s recent appointment of an <ent type='ORG'>IRM</ent> chief, the
<ent type='ORG'>House</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Committee continues to question the department's ability to
keep its <ent type='ORG'>ADP</ent> house in order, especially where it concerns Inslaw and Project
<ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent>.</p>

<p>Next month <ent type='ORG'>Judiciary</ent> Chairman Jack <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> (D-<ent type='GPE'>Texas</ent>) intends to ask <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
officials in a hearing to justify their $35.2 million fiscal 1992 request for
<ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent>.  The committee first raised questions about the office automation
project last year and voiced concerns about general <ent type='ORG'>ADP</ent> oversight.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> last month took steps to address some of these management issues when
it named longtime <ent type='ORG'>IRM</ent> veteran Roger M. Cooper as the first deputy assistant
attorney general for <ent type='ORG'>IRM</ent>.  But Cooper has said he needs some time on the job
before outlining his priorities.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, committee investigators are continuing to prod <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> to provide
them with information for their continuing review of the Inslaw case, in
which <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> is accused of using proprietary software without a license.
Recently the department also has been accused of distributing the product to
other organizations.</p>

<p>Although <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> has threatened to issue subpoenas, investigators might
piggyback on the subpoena power recently won by <ent type='ORG'>Inslaw Inc</ent>. president William
A. Hamilton.</p>

<p>The committee's investigation has been hamstrung by <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>'s unwillingness
to turn over some 200 documents concerning <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent>, the case management system
Hamilton alleges <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> officials stole from his company.  The committee
anticipates these documents will raise more questions and will point to its
next move, a congressional staff member said.</p>

<p>The committee is conducting its investigation independent of information
Inslaw uncovers, but if the company's discovery process turns up evidence
that would be useful, "we will certainly look at it," he said.</p>

<p>Chief Judge Aubrey E. Robinson of the U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>District Court</ent> granted Inslaw
limited discovery authority this month.  It will allow the small <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent>
software company to subpoena information from certain <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> bureaus to
determine whether the department illegally distributed <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent>.</p>

<p>Robinson gave <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> 30 days to respond to the subpoenas.</p>

<p>Inslaw will subpoena information from <ent type='ORG'>the Drug Enforcement Administration</ent>,
the U.S.  Marshals Service, the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>, the Bureau of Prisons, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service and the <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> Management Division, Hamilton
said.</p>

<p>Before granting the motion, Robinson said, "This case has had so many
skirmishes, I don't know whether you will ever get to the major battle."  He
also said the court should not have to monitor <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> continuously to ensure
it obeys the law.</p>

<p>At Hamilton's request, Robinson last month agreed to take over the case from
the U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>Bankruptcy Court</ent>.  Hamilton said Inslaw may request more subpoenas
if the discovery process shows that <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> violated a court injunction
against distributing <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> beyond the 44 copies to which it is entitled
under a 1982 contract.</p>

<p><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> officials continually have denied Inslaw's allegations of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Robinson noted <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>'s argument that some of Inslaw's affidavits include
"<ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ond- or third-hand hearsay."</p>

<p>But Inslaw attorney Charles Work said, "I've got a lot of proof that
something is going on.  I don't have linkage, but if I did I wouldn't be
asking for discovery."</p>

<p>Although <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> has not resorted to subpoenaing <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> officials, he made it
clear in December that he would force <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> to produce the documents he
seeks.  <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> has threatened <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> with subpoenas as well as <ent type='ORG'>ADP</ent> funding
cuts.</p>

<p>Last year, <ent type='ORG'>Brooks</ent> recommended that <ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent>'s fiscal 1991 funding be cut back to
the previous year's spending level.  Instead, the <ent type='ORG'>House</ent> Appropriations
Committee restricted <ent type='ORG'>Eagle</ent> installations to management and litigating
agencies and cut funding by $6.1 million to $16.9 million.</p>

Title:   Spies linked to software scam. (former national <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity adviser
   Robert C. <ent type='ORG'>McFarlane</ent> implicated)
Author:  Anthes, Gary H.</p>

<p>Summary: Small software developer <ent type='ORG'>Inslaw Inc</ent> has been fighting since 1983
   to prove that the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> of <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> misappropriated its
   product, but the case has taken a new twist with the revelation
   that former national <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>urity adviser Robert C. <ent type='ORG'>McFarlane</ent> might be
   linked to case-tracking software allegedly fraudulently obtained
   from Inslaw.  A former <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>i intelligence officer has alleged in
   a sworn statement filed in the <ent type='GPE'>US</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Bankruptcy Court</ent> that <ent type='ORG'>McFarlane</ent>
   gave the software to the <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>i government.  Inslaw claims
   officials of <ent type='ORG'>the <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent></ent> and their friends stole its
   <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> law-enforcement case-tracking software for use in a complex
   series of business arrangements.  Federal bankruptcy judge George
   Bason Jr ruled in favor of Inslaw in 1987, but the <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent>
   <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent> has filed a series of appeals in the intervening years.

<p>Inslaw Head Says Software Passed Like a Hot Potato</p>

<p>Saying four federal judges have passed its <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> software case around like a
"hot potato," <ent type='ORG'>Inslaw Inc</ent>. has persuaded the U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>Bankruptcy Court</ent> to allow
the U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>District Court</ent> to consider an unsettled discovery motion.</p>

<p>The small <ent type='GPE'>Washington</ent> company had wanted senior <ent type='ORG'>District Court</ent> Judge William
B. Bryant to decide a discovery motion filed last September.  In 1989, Bryant
agreed with a 1987 bankruptcy court ruling that <ent type='ORG'><ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> <ent type='ORG'>Department</ent></ent> officials
stole 44 copies of enhanced <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> from Inslaw.</p>

<p>In February, Judge James F. Schneider, the bannruptcy judge who had handled
the case for the past two and a half years, recused himself from the case
citing potential conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>"Now some six months after Inslaw initially asked for limited discovery to
determine whether the injunction had been violated...  Inslaw still has had
no ruling on its motion, and worse still, has no judge to hear it," Inslaw
said in an emergency motion filed last month.</p>

<p>If a court granted Inslaw's motion for discovery, the company could subpoena
information to determine whether <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> had violated an injunction against
distributing copies of <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> beyond what the department acquired through a
1982 contract.</p>

<p>Inslaw officials said they want to withdraw the motion from the bankruptcy
court and resubmit it to the district court because the discovery request is
not a bankruptcy question.</p>

<p>Inslaw president William A. Hamilton said he now believes <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> has been
illegally distributed to <ent type='ORG'>the Central Intelligence Agency</ent>, the Defense
Intelligence Agency, the <ent type='ORG'>National Security Agency</ent> and the <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Inslaw has submitted to the bankruptcy court an affidavit from
regional sales manager Patricia Hamilton that claims <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> government
officials told her their government was using pirated copies of <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> in as
many as 905 locations.  The Royal <ent type='NORP'>Canadian</ent> Mounted Police could be using
<ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent> in 900 of those locations, she said.</p>

<p>A former <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>i intelligence officer alleged in a <ent type='ORG'>sec</ent>ond affidavit that Earl
W. Brian, a friend of former Attorney General Edwin Meese, told him that U.S.
and <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>i intelligence agencies were using <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent>.  The <ent type='GPE'>Israel</ent>i, Ari
Ben-Menashe, also said in the affidavit he had learned that Brian sold <ent type='NORP'>Promis</ent>
to <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>i military intelligence.</p>

<p>Brian has denied these allegations.</p>

<p>Schneider is the third judge to recuse himself from the case, which has been
pending almost five years.  A fourth judge and the first to hear the case,
Judge George F. Bason Jr., "has come to believe that his failure to be
reappointed to the bench was due to the opinions he rendered in this case,"
Inslaw said.</p>

<p>The emergency motion said, "Judge Bryant remains the only sitting judge who
has not removed himself and has knowledge of the facts of the case."</p>

<p>Bryant awarded Inslaw more than $6 million in 1988.  <ent type='ORG'>Justice</ent> is appealing the
U.S.  <ent type='ORG'>District Court</ent> judge's 1989 affirmation of the bankruptcy court's
ruling and has not paid Inslaw any of the awarded money.</p>
