    <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> License Plate Codes</p>

<p> Somewhere in the  vicinity  of  2500  <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent>  and  Eastern  European
 officials live in <ent type='GPE'>the United States</ent>  at  any  given  time.  The U.S.
 State Department estimates that 30% to 40% of them are spies.</p>

<p> This comes to about 900 working spies in the diplomatic corps.</p>

<p> It is a very difficult job to keep track of the comings  and  goings
 of these "diplomats", so the government  has  developed  coded
 diplomatic license plates.</p>

<p> The code applies ONLY to diplomatic  plates  which are conspicuously
 red, white and blue with the word DIPL<ent type='ORG'>OM</ent>AT printed at the top.</p>

<p> All diplomatic licenses  have a D.  The other two  letters  indicate
 the nation. <ent type='ORG'>SX</ent> for example, indicates that the car carries diplomats
 from the <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union.</p>

<p> <ent type='ORG'>FBI</ent> counter-intelligence agents are given wallet-sized cards listing
 the codes for eighteen "problem" nations.</p>

<p> These nations are identified by the following codes :</p>

<p>    Albania   CP    <ent type='GPE'>Libya</ent>   FM
    <ent type='GPE'>Bulgaria</ent>  <ent type='ORG'>OM</ent>    <ent type='GPE'>Nicaragua</ent>   <ent type='GPE'>QU</ent>
    <ent type='GPE'>China</ent>   CY    <ent type='GPE'>North Korea</ent> GQ
    <ent type='GPE'>Cuba</ent>    DC    <ent type='GPE'>Poland</ent>  QW
    Czechoslavakia  PH    Romania ND
    East Germany  TJ    South Africa  FY
    <ent type='GPE'>Hungary</ent>   <ent type='ORG'>KH</ent>    <ent type='NORP'>Soviet</ent> Union  <ent type='ORG'>SX</ent>
    <ent type='GPE'>Iran</ent>    DM    <ent type='GPE'>Syria</ent>   AQ
    <ent type='GPE'>Iraq</ent>    TS    Vietnam LD</p>

<p> The <ent type='ORG'>Washington Post</ent>  published  the  code  against the wishes of the
 State Department.  They feared <ent type='ORG'>RAMBO</ent>  types  might attack diplomatic
 vehicles of countries they did not like.
