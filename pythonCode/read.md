# PythonCode 
## Notes
- You will need to uncomment the ```nlp = spacy.cli.download("en_core_web_lg")``` to download the language model stuff.  u can uncomment it once it downloads. 
- The ```re``` library includes our Regex functions. It is called using ```regex```. It uses standard regular expression stuff. 
- Everytime ```main.py``` launches, ```outputNames.txt``` clears. It will need to go through the entirety of our files, which still has to be done. Will all of the files work??? 
- We will need to modify code so that it can produce new ```.xml``` files. Probably best to output files in new directory or something once we get started on that.
