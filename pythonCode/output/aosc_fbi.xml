<p>SYSTEM PROFILE - The FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</p>

<p>History</p>

<p>The FBI traces its roots back to the year 1908 when then U.S. Attorney General
<ent type = 'person'>Charles Bonaparte</ent> directed that Department of Justice investigations be handled
by a small group of special investigators. The group was formed as the Bureau
of Investigation and, in 1935, the present day name was designated by Congress.</p>

<p>Duties</p>

<p>The primary functions of the FBI and its agents are the investigations of
violations of certain Federal statutes and the collection of evidence in cases
in which the United States is or may be an interested party. The FBI performs
other duties specifically imposed by law or Presidential directive and conducts
a number of service activities for other law enforcement agencies. The FBI can
investigate a matter only when it has authority to do so under a law passed by
Congress or on instructions of the President or the Attorney General.</p>

<p>The FBI is not a Federal police force, it is a fact-finding organization
investigating violations of Federal laws and its authority is strictly limited
to matters within its jurisdiction. FBI agents may make arrests without a
warrant for any Federal offense committed in their presence, or when they have
reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or
is attempting to commit a felony violation of United States laws. Agents may
also make arrests by warrant.</p>

<p>Agents do not make arrests for "investigation" or "on suspicion". Before
arrests are made, if at all possible, the facts of each case are presented tom
the U.S. Attorney who decides whether or not a Federal violation has occurred
and, if so, the U.S. Attorney may authorize agents to file a complaint which
serves as the basis of the arrest warrant.</p>

<p>The FBI has no authority to investigate local crimes which are not within its
jurisdiction. The FBI will, however, render all possible assistance to the
local police through the FBI Laboratory and Identification Division. The FBI
LID maintains fingerprint files on approximately 70 million (yes, million)
people. The FBI also maintains the National Crime Information Center (N<ent type = 'person'>CI</ent>C)
which keeps records of missing persons, serialized stolen property, wanted
persons for whom an arrest warrant is outstanding, and criminal histories on
individuals arrested and fingerprinted for serious or significant offenses.</p>

<p>The N<ent type = 'person'>CI</ent>C is a computerized information system established by the FBI as a
service to all criminal justice agencies- local, state and Federal. The
information can be instantly retrieved over a vast communications network
through the use of telecommunications equipment in criminal justice centers in
various locations in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Many times when
monitoring the local or county police/sheriff departments a reference to a N<ent type = 'person'>CI</ent>C
check is heard.</p>

<p>The FBI is involved in criminal investigations and foreign counterintelligence
efforts. Most notably criminal investigations are those of bank robberies and
kidnapping cases. The FBI can also investigate criminal activity associated
with interstate transportation of stolen property, and the FBI can investigate
graft and corruption cases of local government under certain circumstances.
Department of Justice offices mat be found on some military installations as
the FBI has jurisdiction when a crime involves Government property, or funds,
or when only civilians are involved.</p>

<p>The FBI's responsibility with respect to foreign counterintelligence, within
the United States, is to detect, lawfully counteract, and/or prevent espionage
and other clandestine intelligence activities, sabotage, international
terrorist activities, or assassinations conducted for or on behalf of foreign
powers, organizations, or persons. The FBI also investigates murders,
kidnappings, and assaults against foreign diplomatic officials while in the
United States, as well as damage to property of foreign governments in the
United States.</p>

<p>Organization</p>

<p>The FBI is an agency within the U.S. Department of Justice, which is lead by
the U.S. Attorney General. The head of the FBI is the Director who is appointed
by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Assistant directors
are the next level of command within the FBI. The FBI has ten assistant
directors who are accountable to the Director for all matters within their
sphere of operations.</p>

<p>The FBI has 59 field offices located in major cities throughout the United
States and in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Each, with the exception of the New York
Office which is headed by an Assistant Director, is under the direct
supervision of a Special Agent In Charge (SAIC). The SAIC is supervised and
receives directions from the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Each FBI Field Office has Resident Agencies which are local offices in some of
the larger cities within the field offices jurisdiction. Refer to the FBI field
office map for the sectioning of the field offices across the United States.

<p>The list of Field Offices and RA's is not 100% accurate, updates please. The
number of RA's may differ from the call letter assignment block for a given
F.O. because many RA's were closed and consolidated during the <ent type = 'person'>Carter</ent> and early
<ent type = 'person'>Regan</ent> administrations. The call letters were assigned prior to their
administrations.</p>

<p>The F.O. call letters will be the first is an assigned block for a given F.O.
Example Cincinnati F.O. call is KQC 390 (or simply 390 as often will be heard)
or Cleveland F.O. call is KEX 740 (740).</p>

<p>The following is a list of Resident Agencies for the primary coverage states of
the AOSC. The list is as of 1 October 1987. I will send a copy of the FBI Field
Office and Resident Agency map for a SASE to those who desire a copy. A list of
RA's may be obtained from the map for your local area. The map will be a copy
of a copy, however it will be fairly legible. Note the two Ohio Field Office
lists are presented later in this column with the detailed Ohio data.</p>

   A-8 163.8375/167.2875  B-8 163.8375/167.2875</p>

<p>Chicago F.O. utilizes 8 banks, A through H. Channel banks C through H are not
confirmed to exact frequencies and usage. There are one way links in the upper
162, lower 164 and upper 165 MHz ranges. The one way links are often a control
station to a repeater site utilizing a directional antenna. The one way links
may also be a point-to-point relay of communications from an outer fringe RA to
the F.O.</p>

<p>Chicago appears to configured similarly as several other F.O.'s in that up to
five other VHF frequencies can be active with 163.9875 simultaneously with the
same radio traffic. Chicago F.O. also still uses some remote VHF receive/UHF
re-transmit link sites, but most are believed to be converted to microwave
links.</p>

located in Athens, Chillicothe, Columbus, Dayton, Hamilton, Portsmouth,
Springfield, Steubenville and Zanesville. The Springfield office is closed and
I am not sure about the Zanesville R.A.</p>

<p>The <ent type = 'person'>CI</ent> F.O. and R.A.'s radio communication systems are DES (Digital Encryption
Standard) capable and are utilized on a regular basis. <ent type = 'person'>CI</ent> appears to have a 32
channel DES system in place as testing was monitored during 1988 and 1989. Most
of their frequencies remained the same from the previous DES days. Note that
the <ent type = 'person'>CI</ent> radios are VHF/UHF mobiles. Refer to the B channel series in the
frequency list.</p>

<p>The signal numbers do not appear to be squad base (logically grouping by
general agent function such as bank robbery squad or drug enforcement, or by
R.A.'s), but rather a numeric numbering scheme starting with 1 and into the low
100's.</p>

<p>The <ent type = 'person'>CI</ent> F.O./R.A. operations still need some work from our southern Ohio members
as allot of holes and gaps remain. The following profile on <ent type = 'person'>CI</ent> was mainly made
possible by the efforts of Bill Gillie, Tony Cono, Rick Poorman, another member
who desires to named Mr. <ent type = 'person'>Anonymous</ent>, and this editor.</p>

<p>NOTE: ALL OHIO data is confirmed unless noted otherwise.</p>

<p>CLEVELAND FIELD OFFICE OPERATIONS</p>

<p>The Cleveland Field Office originally had 10 Resident Agencies located in
Akron, Canton, Elyria, Lima, Mansfield, Mentor, Painesville, <ent type = 'person'>Sandusky</ent>, Toledo
and Youngstown. The Mentor R.A. currently is the only R.A. out of service in
the CV division.</p>

<p>The CV F.O. And R.A.'s radio communication system is DES capable and utilized
quite often in the DES mode. The CV F.O. has been in DES since the mid-eighties
on a limited basis and a full system since early 1989. The CV system appears to
be a 64 channel system which was implemented during the latter part of 1989.</p>

<p>The CV division utilizes a squad numbering scheme for assignment of signal
numbers. There are still a few holes in the numbering, but for the most part it
is complete.</p>

<p>FBI COMMON FREQUENCY RANGES</p>

<p>I suggest searching the following frequency ranges for FBI radio activity. Note
that in many areas across the U.S. the FBI have picked up many traditional
non-FBI frequencies. Originally the Department of Justice had only 82 VHf
frequencies assigned for ALL of its members, let alone just the FBI. The FBI
originally had less than 40 of the 82 frequencies for their exclusive use.</p>

<p>During the change over to DES nationwide, the FBI has received additional
frequencies from other branches and departments who did not utilize or need
them. In the NE region the FBI received 110 VHF frequencies - almost 300%
increase in the number of frequencies available. The early days saw the FBI in
the 163 MHz range for repeaters and the 167 MHz range for simplex operations.</p>

<p>Limit your search to 500 KHz at a time, certainly no more than a 1 MHz. The
following are common ranges reported nationwide:</p>

<p>   162.6125 - 162.7875 Repeater Inputs; Outputs; 12.5KHz steps
   163.825  - 163.9875 Repeater Outputs; 12.5KHz steps
   164.000  - 164.500  Repeater Outputs; 25KHz steps
   165.5125 - 165.900  Repeater Outputs; 12.5KHz steps
   167.100  - 167.7875 Repeater Inputs; Outputs; Simplex; 12.5KHz steps
   168.825  - 169.000  Repeater Inputs; 25KHz steps
   169.825  - 169.975  Repeater Outputs; 25KHz steps</p>

<p>FEDERAL NEWS - FBI</p>

<p>The FCC has established a nationwide radio frequency for stolen vehicle
tracking systems operating on the frequency of 173.025. The frequency was
reported as a FBI assignment (wouldn't we like to see the exact frequency
assignment chart?) Nationwide. Perhaps this frequency was used for wireless
microphones or bugs, and if so perhaps others operate on nearby similar
frequencies. Give it a listen and let us know.</p>

<p>The FBI Academy, located 40 miles south of Washington, is the host to the most
crime ridden town in the United States - <ent type = 'person'>Hogan</ent>'s Alley. <ent type = 'person'>Hogan</ent>'s Alley is a
"Hollywood" town with a motel, bank, post office, drug store, laundry and even
a theater. It is used as a training ground for FBI agent trainees. Various
scenarios are enacted under the careful eyes of supervisors. The trainees
performance are evaluated with each exercise.</p>

<p>One thing about <ent type = 'person'>Hogan</ent>'s Alley - it has a 100% success rate in solving of cases,
pretty impressive. Something that is not pretty impressive about the FBI is the
starting pay agents earn. According to a 8 January 1990 U.S. News and World
Report quirk the starting pay of a FBI agent is $26,261. Consider that an agent
does not choice his assignment location, the agent could be placed in a very
high cost of living area. Placement in certain cities such as NYC offer
slightly more pay, however it is not enough for the work that they perform for
all of us. Yet even worse is the pay for DEA agents $19,493 to $23,846.</p>

<p>The Congress is aware of these low salaries (after all they, the Congressmen
and Senators literally took care of themselves) and will hopefully rectify the
problem this year.
