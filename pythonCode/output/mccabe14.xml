<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   A PICTURE OF LIFE IN A CATHOLIC COUNTRY</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   A few weeks ago there came to me, by a subterranean route, a
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oignant letter from a man who has lived, in intimacy with the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le, for many years in a Catholic country of Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e. The <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress
always refers to this country as a ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>y little land of democratic
sym<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>athies and entirely Roman Catholic. Its virtual ruler is
described as a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>articularly enlightened, u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>right, and humane
statesman. You have <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>robably seen films of grou<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s of its workers
singing, laughing, and dancing merrily in a sunny world; though if
you had not been misled by <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress-references you would have detected
signs of extreme <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>overty and would have seen that the gaiety is
that of illiterate, densely ignorant men and women at, culturally,
the lowest level of civilized life. In s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ite of disease,
ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loitation, and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>overty they are "ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>y," in a sub-human way --
until they begin to question the justice of the joint tyranny of
Church and Dictator. But the bold bad man is quickly removed to a
jail in which the vilest medieval torture is used today -- one
American writer who is not anti-Catholic has described these 
tortures -- or to the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>urgatory of a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>enal colony.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The first letter I received told me that the land is entirely
Fascist, which I knew; that all the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests belong to the Fascist
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arty, which is also called Catholic Action and holds its meetings
in the Churches, and that every boy or youth works in it. The local
news<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ers <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>raise the Germans every day as well as the Italians. In
the course of a recent editorial one said: "If God so wills it we
must substitute the cross of the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Swastika</ent> for the cross of Christ."
The British and American <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ers which were then assuring us that
"the brave little <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le" would resist the German <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ressure which
was being exerted on them did not quote this. A <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>raising
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> in a sermon said that he was "a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ointed by God to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>unish the
world for its irreligion." But my informant added a concrete little
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>icture which stimulated my a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>etite for further news.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   On the outskirts of the city a man -- not a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oor working man
but an educated and comfortable man -- had a farm. His most
valuable <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ig fell ill, and my friend suggested sending for a vet.
Oh, no, what could a vet do against the Evil Eye? Next morning a
solemn <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rocession made its way from the church to the sty. The
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest wore over his cassock and sur<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lice a richly embroidered
shawl that is used in dealing with the devil. Altar-boys, one
swinging a censer, walked on either side of him, and the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le,
mumbling on their beads, walked behind. They fell on their knees
round the sty while the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest waved the fumes of incense at the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ig and recited his incantations. The <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ungent smoke got u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ig's nose, and it staggered to its feet; and the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le cried "A
miracle." The <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest received his 100 eggs and 2 hens, but the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ig
died next day. Seeing that it was going to die, the owner had sold
it to the local butcher to be turned into food for the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le. He
then quietly substituted another <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ig for it, and this wallowed in
the same <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oisonous filth as its <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>redecessor; but there was now a
bottle of holy water hanging from the roof of the sty to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotect
it.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I naturally wanted more of this for my readers, and I got it.
Before I quote it let me ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lain. My informant would be ruined and
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>unished if he were traced, so I make certain details not as
convenient as they might be for the Catholic detective. He is not
a working man but a well-educated middle-class man of high
character. The <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lace from which he writes is not a rural district
but an old city of 30,000 <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le, well known to thousands of
Americans and Britons, but they are either Catholics or they <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>refer
to kee<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> their mouths closed. The country will doubtless be
identified by some of my reader's, but I will say only that it is
not at all considered the most backward in Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e, though the great
majority of the workers are illiterate. It is solidly Catholic. The
writer is absolutely reliable both in regard to first-hand
knowledge and on conscientiousness, and I omit from the long
account only a few <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assages that are relevant to my <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ur<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ose:</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   "A few year's ago this country made a Pact with the Vatican,
and one notices more and more the growing <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower of the Church. At
government ceremonies, which are often held out of doors here, the
bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> (who by the way has eight illegitimate children) leads the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rocession in full regalia and gives the Fascist salute. A new law
has been <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assed by which all schools must be of one sex, with the
subtle idea of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>utting the secular schools out of action. This law 
a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lies even to infants' schools.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   "I know the wife of a chemist whose husband is being
threatened by the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests with boycott as she refuses to attend
mass. A man can have as many mistresses as he likes but it is a
crime for a cou<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le to set u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> home together unless they are married.
It is forbidden to let them a house. Civil marriage is done away
with, and one can only marry in the church. There is much
emigration to South America, and if a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson takes a letter from a
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest Saying that he is a good Catholic he can get a good job. Of
courage, an offering for masses will always secure a good letter
though one never goes to mass. ... A S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anish friend of mine
described the national system in a nutshell. He said it was as if
the head of a family had a large box of gold heavily guarded and
refused to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art with a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>enny of it though all the family were dying
of hunger. A writer described this country as a huge <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rison ke<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t
down by force. There is a state of misery here that you never could
imagine. I ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ened to know well a skilled workman who has two
weeks off work and two weeks on, and he earns 85 cents a day when
working. But when he has <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aid his dues to the Syndicate [the form
of Trade Union im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osed on Catholics by the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al Encyclical and
counts his two weeks idle his <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ay works out at 35 cents a day, and
on this seven <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le must live. ... The cruel joke is that there is
a law that no man must get less than 50 cents a day but the
government themselves <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ay 20 cents. The usual wage of a workman is
25 cents. So, being unable to live on that as he invariably has a
big family he must send his children on the streets to beg. The
streets are thronged with starving whining beggars, with little
children with their stomachs swollen, and dro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ing blood in the
streets in the last stages of starvation.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   "Pro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erty rights are very severe, and a man may 'Shoot on
sight any who enters his <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erty. Lately on the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erty of the
richest Englishman here two men were found s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eared to death. One
was a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oor old man of 72 who was collecting a few sticks for his
fire, and one a young fellow who had the audacity to use the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erty as a short cut. No one took any notice. I just ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ened to
hear of the incident as I lived near. All relations between the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le are vicious, and there is none of that kindly feeling or
sym<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>athy that one gets among the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oor in England. The rich have
their houses barred and bolted and scarcely ever hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>. Their
sur<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lus money goes to building <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivate cha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>els or at least
enriching them; as there is one in every rich or middle-class
house, or else the money goes directly to the Church. ... For every
one who finds comfort there are 99 who only find terror and worry.
My life as a R.C. was a horror. I lived in terror of sin, terror of
confession, terror of sex, and the su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>reme terror was of death and
hell. How often I lay shivering in bed thinking that this night I
would surely die and be weighed in the scales of God, so
gra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hically described to me by the Catholic teachers. Other nights
I lay listening, listening for the devil's cart, driven by headless
horsemen and horses and conveying the children who did not say
their <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rayers, and I <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ictured with what glee the devil would throw
them into hell. As a farmer's cart <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assed rattling over the cobble
stone's in my imagination I could hear the devil's chains rattling
and thought it would sto<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> at our door and collect me. When day came
I was braver and followed all the funerals to the cemetery to make
the sign of the Cross over the Catholic graves and s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>it on the
Protestant ones. I waited, trembling, for the ser<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ent to jum<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> out 
of my mouth after making what I thought was a bad communion.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   "All hos<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>itals are in the hands of religious [monks and nuns]
with no qualifications whatever and more often than not illiterate.
I had occasion to go to the Red Cross the other day. The doctor was
absent, and not one of the three nuns in charge could write a note
for him. A trained nurse offered her services free to the hos<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ital
but they refused as she was not a nun. A young girl whom I know,
living with a man, was forced to have an o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eration without an
anaesthetic in <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>unishment for her sin. She has been a nervous wreck
ever since. I saw a sweet little girl of four die the other day.
The <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest had advised them not to have a doctor as God had need of
another little angel in heaven. A man was dying with T.B. and a
foreign nurse begged to be allowed to give him a drug but the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest forbade it, as it would be against the will of God. Man must
suffer.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   "To me child labor is the most terrible crime here. They have
little children from the age of seven onward as servants, and they
sometimes <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ay them nothing. The <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arents are glad to get rid of them
for their kee<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>. They usually slee<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> on the floor in the coal-bin and
are often beaten. Someone once recommended to me a woman to do
washing, and a well-dressed woman, armed with a stick, came along
with a little boy of about ten. She was going to su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erintend while
he did the washing. One never sees a child <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>laying on the streets,
nor are there any <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arks or <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>laygrounds for them. The schools are
free, but the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arents must <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovide books, etc. and children without
books are not allowed to enter: an order which excludes. all the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oor. The teachers are unqualified. The soldiers get about half a
cent a day and two meals of meat, but one can get exem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tion by
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aying, so the army is com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osed of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oor and under-nourished.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   "I ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ect you read in the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ers how our government was
unanimously elected. It was such a farce. A notice a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eared in the

add: "If you don't vote you will lose your job." The government is
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>utting u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> a lot of show buildings while there is a terrible dearth
of houses for the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le. Rents are high in com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arison with wages.
The houses at $8 a month are one or two-roomed and usually without
windows. I have seen a Seven-roomed house without windows. The

on the street drying."</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The rest of the letter is too <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersonal and might give more
away than the writer su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oses. I will note only that revolt against
this brutal system flickers u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> here and there but the s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>read of the
fire is truculently <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>revented. There is actually a small
Freethought Society in the town, but it meets in such secrecy that
my informant has never been able to get in touch with it. The eyes,
and ears of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests are everywhere, and if the economic wea<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   But the above extracts, referring to many sides of life in a
strictly Catholic city, will suffice for my <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ur<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ose. I do not 
su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ose that in America the a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologist ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lains the defects of his
church, as he does in Britain, as due entirely to its Protestant
environment. You should see Catholic life in a Catholic country, he
is fond of saying. It must be difficult to use that <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>iece of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ious
dece<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tion in the United States. Folk down south are too near to
Mexico and u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> north too near to Quebec; while engineers and others
who have lived in Columbia, Bolivia, or Brazil tell funny stories.
Most <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le, however, know these foreign lands only from films
which conceal more than they show, and this little sketch of life
in a really Catholic city -- it is 90 <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ercent Catholic and 70
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ercent illiterate -- heavily rebukes the a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologist.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I should like to follow it u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> with a sketch of life in Russia
before the Beasts of Berlin broke unto it. Sociologists generally
agree that one of the best tests of a civilization is the way it
treats its children; one ought to say, how it treats the children
of workers. Whatever faults some find in Russia or the Soviet Union
it is agreed by all ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erts on this side of its life that it gives
a better time to the children than any other country in the world.
Before the Revolution or the last war the children had as miserable
a time as in this Catholic country. One of the toughest <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roblems
the Soviet authorities had to solve was the reduction of juvenile
crime, and travelers in Tsarist Russia used to tell of child
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rostitutes of 13 soliciting o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>enly near the baths. Now Russia, and
es<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecially Moscow, treat children as honored guests. They neither
beg nor work and they are <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oles removed from the cruelly-treated
starvelings, dri<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ing blood on the streets, of this Catholic city.
Instead of being excluded from schools because they have no shoes
-- which in Russia ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ens only in summer in the country -- the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oorest have the same teaching and the same holidays and
entertainments as the children of the best <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aid.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   But I am concerned here with the workers not with the
children, though the fact that vast numbers of them cannot feed the
large families which the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>el them to have is a
significant detail. A Catholic writer will tell you only, and
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roudly, that there is a minimum wage fixed by law. Here, from one
who has moved intimately among them for years -- I can vouch for
that -- is the truth. They are "the stinkers" as the Tsarist
aristocrats used to call the workers, the "clods" as rich folk
called them in medieval England. They may be killed for gathering
a little fallen wood on or taking a short cut through your estate.
It is a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>icture of com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rehensive injustice and ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loitation.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   But how far is this re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resentative of the condition of the
workers in Catholic countries generally? Let us try to ascertain
this on strict sociological lines. In which countries of the world
have the great majority of the workers, by general agreement, the
highest standard of living? I confine the com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arison to the great
majority, the regular worker's, because the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oorest are at much the
same level of life in all countries. If there is any difference
their condition is exce<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tionally bad in such Catholic countries as
Poland (before the war), S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain, Portugal, and Brazil. In any case
we reach a sound verdict only if we com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>are the great mass of the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le in different countries.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It will surely be admitted that the highest standard of living
for the largest majority of the workers is enjoyed in the United
States, Soviet Russia, Great Britain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rewar Germany, and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rewar France. I would <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut them in
that order but there is no need to go into that question. The <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint
is that these are all countries in which the Church of Rome has no
influence on the status of the workers. The one-eighth Catholic
minority in America and France and the one-twenty-fifth minority in
Britain may hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> to sour certain as<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ects of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublic life by Sunday
Laws, Blue Laws, Marriage Laws, etc., but we should smile if they,
claimed to have any res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>onsibility for the economic basis of the
standard of life of the workers. If this were the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lace to go more
fully into the question we might make a stronger case. While for
instance, the workers of the United States will be <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut by most
students -- some, who know the vast range of free services in
Russia might <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>refer the Soviet workers -- at the head of the list
it is very doubtful if we should find as high a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortion of
Catholic workers -- Poles, Irish, Italians, Mexicans, etc. -- in
the higher as in the lower class of workers.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   But we must take it here on broad lines. The countries in
which the workers are best-off are those in which Catholicism is
not among the factors which determine the standard of living. At
the next level we should, still looking only to economic and social
well-being, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut Holland -- many might <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut this at the higher level
-- Belgium, Hungary, Austria, Italy, Jugo-Slavia, Rumania, and
Bulgaria. The <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortion of Catholic influence rises and the
standard of living falls. And at the lowest of three levels few
would hesitate to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain, Portugal, Poland, and the Latin-
American Re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublics generally. I have omitted Czecho-Slovakia only
because of its com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osite nature, but everybody knows that the
status of the workers was highest in Bohemia, lower in more
Catholic Moravia, and lowest in entirely Catholic Slovakia. Asia we
naturally leave out of com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arison.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   We might go further and cheek our conclusion by asking in
which countries and under what condition the status of the workers
has risen most ra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>idly in recent times and in which it has advanced
little or not at all. Russia takes first <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lace, and the character
of the u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lifting factors is well known. The least Catholic <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art of
Czecho-Slovakia and Denmark <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>robably come next. If we distinguish
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriods of betterment and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriods of reaction we have to assign a
notable advance to the S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aniards and the Austrians under Socialism
and a notable reaction to the Italian workers during the last
twelve years and to those of Austria, S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain, Portugal, and Latin
America generally since they <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assed under the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al-Fascist flag.
If the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resent Fascist-Catholic rulers (under Germany) of Belgium
and France were to survive and carry out their declared <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lans the
status of the workers there also would deteriorate.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   In fact, we come in the end to a very interesting and
significant contrast. The democracies -- the United States,
Britain, Czecho-Slovakia, Holland, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway,
and Sweden (all non-Catholic) -- will, when Nazism is destroyed,
resume their character and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rogress. The Vatican, on the other hand
seeks, whatever the issue of the war is, to retain control of
Belgium, France, Slovakia, Croatia, Italy, S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain, Portugal, and the</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>    THOSE BEAUTIFUL PAPAL ENCYCLICALS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   A learned <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofessor of religious views scribbled a marginal
note on a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>age of one of my books in which I had summed u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> vile
social condition of Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e in the last century, after 1500 year of
Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower. With the usual air of su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriority he wrote: "But the
Churches only took u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> social work at the end of the 19th Century."
Which was <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>recisely my com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>laint. For nearly 15 centuries the Roman
clergy had contem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lated without any serious interference with it,
a social order in which, a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art from it other vices, the great mass
of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le, the workers, were treated with grave injustice and,
during most of the time with contem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t and cruelty.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   If an a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologist were to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lead that the clergy had so much to
do in looking after the immortal souls of men that you could not
ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ect them to study social conditions you would smile, if you know
the moral history of Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e, but you might grant the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lea a certain
amount of logic. But the Catholic a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologist does not, and dare not,
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut forward that very frail excuse. He says, on the contrary, that
the Church is, and always was, the friend, the very best friend, of
the workers. I hardly need to quote Catholic literature on that. It
is the su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>reme cham<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ion of justice and has always stood with its
flaming sword between the hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>less workers and the greedy. In a
moment we shall find the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> saying that very em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hatically.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   As far as the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ast is concerned we will briefly run over the
record in the next cha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ter, but two reflection's at once occur to
us. Must not this cham<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ionshi<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> of the cause of the workers have
been extraordinarily ineffective seeing that the workers themselves
had to ware a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rodigious fight in the last century against
injustices which had lasted for centuries? And is it not a Singular
thing that the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ronouncements of <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>s</ent> on the subject which
Catholic a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists quote all belong to the last 50 years? With
great audacity they quote, when they call the Church the friend of
freedom and democracy, writers of nearly seven centuries ago like
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Thomas Aquinas</ent> (who defended slavery), but they do not seem to get
further back than <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent> when they seek <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roof of the
Church's interest in the workers. Everybody who knows anything
about socio-economic history knows that the great fight, the heroic
and bloody fight, the fight in which you hazarded your life or
liberty, for justice to the workers was, broadly, from about 1780
to 1880, yet the first favorable Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al declaration they quote is of
the year 1891.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Why dig u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> so much history, Catholics <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eevishly ask me? The
value of the Church today lies in its teaching today, and Catholic
writers fill books with the bold and sound declarations of the
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>s</ent> from 1891 onward. The fight was still on, and the "great
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>" ranged himself on the side of the workers with such
utterances that he was called the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> of the Workers, even the
Socialist <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>, the author of the Magria Charta of Labor. I
remember the fuss well, having just then been a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ointed <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofessor
in a Catholic seminary. Radical <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ers were lyrical; reactionary
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ers were annoyed. But before you rush to a library for a
Catholic book to tell you all about this "Charter of Labor's
Rights" read the biogra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hical notice of <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent> in the
Encyclo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>edia Britannica; and it is so sound that the Catholic
revisers -- to be <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olite -- of the latest edition of that work have
not ventured to alter it. The writer, Dr. <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Bryant</ent>, tell's how <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent>
startled the world with his radicalism in 1891 but adds that he
fell back into sheer reaction before he died. He says:</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>  In 1902 the Sacred Congregation of Extraordinary
   Ecclesiastical Affairs issued instructions concerning
   Christian democracy in Italy, directing that the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ular
   Christian movement which embraced in its <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rogram a number of
   social reforms such as factory laws for children, old-age
   <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ensions, a minimum wage in agricultural industries, an eight
   hour day, the revival of trade <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>gilds</ent>, and the encouragement of
   Sunday rest, should divert its attention from all such things
   as savored of novelty and devote its energies to the
   restoration of the Tem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oral Power.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Did you ever find your attention called to that miserable
change of the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s social creed in any one of the very numerous
books and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>am<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hlets written in America on the grand and ins<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>iring
call for justice of <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent>? You certainly did not. Catholic Truth
does not do such things. In science a man who made much of a
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assage from an earlier great scientist and did not mention that it
was retracted in his later years would be discredited. In the field
of sacred literature he is just clever.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   However, what was this bold and "magnificent" declaration of
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent>? It is contained in the encyclical (or to-all-the-
world) letter Rerum novarum -- these encyclicals are named from the
first two words of the latin text -- of the year 1891. You will
find it useful to consider the historical background. Some ten
years earlier the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> had struck a bargain with Bismarck. The
Catholic Church in Germany would enlist all its <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower in Bismarck's
fight against Socialism and for militarism if he would quit his
cam<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aign against the Church itself. It did not make an atom of
difference to Social Democracy. At the German election of 1887 the
Socialists <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olled 763,128 votes: at the election of 1890 their vote
rose to 1,427,298. In 1890 the Socialist vote in Austria was
750,000, and it was about half a million in France. In other words,
the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy of sheer o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition to Socialism had dismally failed.
Catholic workers were leaving the Church in millions because it
o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osed justice to the workers.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   So <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent>, or his advisers -- he knew nothing about economic
matters, or indeed any other matters exce<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t Church stuff and the 
Latin classics -- had the brilliant idea of taking the wind out of
the Socialist sails by a solemn statement of the attitude of the
Church to Labor questions which would dis<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lease the em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyers and
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resumably win the admiration of the workers. The Encyclical was
translated into most languages, and even the secular <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress hailed
it as a revolutionary <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ronouncement. It still shines in American
a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologetic literature. The Catholic will tell you that the Church
has formulated the Charter of the Rights of Labor in two great
encyclicals, <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>the Rerum Novarum</ent> of <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent> and the Quadragesimo

however, you will find that the latter has not been translated into
English -- for reasons which you will understand <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resently -- but
the message of <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent> is (if you conceal his retraction of it)
written in letters of bronze on a block of granite.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Surely, you think, it must be really good. You shall judge for
yourself. I have just read it carefully through once more and made
a syno<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>sis of it, and, as a chea<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> translation is still available,
you can check my <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>recis of it.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ens with the reflection that something must be done to
im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rove the condition of the workers. The <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>gilds</ent>, which under the
lead of the Church so long <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotected them, were, the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> says,
"destroyed in the last century." As every student of such matters
knows that they died a natural death, or were (if there is question
of destruction) destroyed by the workers themselves in the 15th
Century, this is not a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>romising beginning. It gets worse. Owing to
the s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>read of irreligion the callous world of the 19th Century <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut
nothing in the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lace of these beneficent Catholic <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>gilds</ent>, and the
workers were left to be ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loited by "a small number of very rich
men," while "crafty agitators" led the workers by the nose in the
wrong direction. Socialism cannot be acce<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ted as a remedy because
it is itself unjust and futile. It denies the right of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivate
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erty -- the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> seems to think that under Socialism you cannot
have your own books, car<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ets, or etchings -- and in this it is
immoral. It <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>reaches a class-war, which is wicked, wasteful,
whereas if em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyers and workers were all religious (Catholics)
they would live in a beautiful atmos<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>here of brotherhood, and the
rich would give generous alms to the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oor. That is the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s idea
of the Middle Ages.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   About half the encyclical is taken u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> with moral <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>latitudes
and factual inaccuracies of this sort. The idea that the workers of
Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e were <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotected by <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>gilds</ent> until the French Revolution and that

truculently forbidden in all countries, Catholic and Protestant,
from the 16th Century until the 19th, but at least there was in

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotection of the workers, and by 1891 the leading States were
considering or inaugurating schemes of old-age <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ensions, widows' 
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ensions, sick and unem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyment insurance, etc. The Kaiser
formulated this <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rogram for Germany and at once started work on it
in 1890.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   However, let us come to the "constructive" <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art of the great
Charter. If the workers realize that it is "no disgrace" to work if
you do not ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>en to "<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ossess the gifts of fortune," and if the
em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyers "do not tax the workers beyond his strength" and "give
every one that which is just" this "thorny <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roblem of ca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ital and
labor is well on the way to settlement. It takes a <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> to discover
things like that. For a moment the ca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>italists get a jolt when the
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> says that "it is only by the labor of the working man that
States grow rich" but, needless to say, he does not <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ass on to
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Marx</ent>'s theory of sur<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lus value, of which he had <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>robably never
heard. It is just a clumsy way of saying that ca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ital cannot
dis<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ense with labor. Then, after an excursus on the divine origin
of authority and the duty of the State to check em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyers who
im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ose conditions which injure the morals, religion, or health --
as I said, Britain already had a whole code of laws checking such
em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyers -- of the workers, the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> gets to concrete <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osals.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The "revolution" is su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osed to be here. The <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> mentions the
strike as a wea<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on of the workers and does not condemn it. He is
content to say that if the State were guided by religion it would
see that the grounds of strikes did not exist. Then we get the
"rights" of the workers. They must have a day's rest on Sunday (and
go to church), they must not be com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>elled to work such hours that
it "stu<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>efies their minds and wears out their bodies," and the
wages must be "sufficient to su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ort a frugal and well-behaved
working man." All this had been a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>latitude of Radical (and much
Liberal) as well as Socialist literature for several decades, and
the astonishment of the world that a <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> should <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>indorse</ent> the claim
of one day's rest in seven (which had been normal in Protestant
countries for three centuries) and that men should not be
overworked is really a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roof of its insincerity in its new
admiration of the Church of Rome. If there was any "revolution" it
was in the fact that the Roman Church had com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rehensively and
officially o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osed the rights of the workers for more than 100
years, or since they had been clearly formulated on the eve of the
French Revolution, and now that it saw the workers deserting it in
millions it admitted the most elementary of those rights.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The American Catholic a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists on the social side Com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>letely
ignore these as<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ects of the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s deliverance. They surely know
that what he calls "crafty agitators" had been demanding these
rights for the workers for 100 years yet they re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resent the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> as
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>utting some <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofound new social wisdom before the world. They lay
no stress on the really revolutionary -- if it were clearly and
sincerely meant -- statement that "it is only by the labor of the
working man that States grow rich." Catholic social writers would
not dare to say that themselves in America today. It is the
essential basis of Bolshevism, the essential meaning of the hammer
and sickle. But I agree with them here that the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> meant no more
than that the miner <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roduces coal and the agricultural worker corn.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>Any other meaning is quite inconsistent with the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s -- indeed
all <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>s</ent> -- settled social ethic that the division of the race
into masters (<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivate em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyers) and wage-earners is in accordance
with the divine will.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   As to the Sunday rest -- which, by the way, Britain, America,
Germany, etc., not only granted but sternly insisted on for
religious reasons -- the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofit of the Church itself is here too
clear for us to consider it disinterested. Of the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotest
against overwork also we take no notice. At the time when he wrote
this there had been a mighty and successful struggle for the
reduction of hours and the curtailment of the work of women and
children in Great Britain for 70 years and for a generation in
America, France, and Germany. It was Catholic countries like Italy,
S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain, and Portugal that needed the moralist, and neither then nor
at any, later date until Socialism became a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower did they carry
out any serious reform. In fact, the worst condition of labor,
es<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecially child labor, continued to be found in Catholic South
Italy, S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain (exce<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t 1932-6), Portugal, and Poland right down to
the outbreak of the war.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The gem of the encyclical is said by the a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists to be the
demand for "a living wage." It is the minimum demand that any
reformer ever drew u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> because, obviously, the far greater question
is: What is a living wage? The <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>, in any case, did not use that
very familiar <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hrase, and how any Catholic em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyer in the world
could object to what he did say is incom<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rehensible. In two
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assages the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> goes beyond the hoary old Church-<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>latitude that
in rewarding labor em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyers must be "just" -- leaving it to them
to say what is just. The first short <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assage is said in one
"official" translation to be that the wage must <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovide "the means
of living a tolerable and ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>y life." The word "ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>y" is here
arbitrarily inserted. The Latin text has no such word. The other
official translation is that the wage must suffice "to su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ort the
wage-earner in reasonable and frugal comfort," The word
"reasonable" again is a trick. The correct translation is: "The
wage must be enough to feed a frugal and well-behaved worker." What
a revolutionary sentiment in the year 1891!</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   In the next <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aragra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>h the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> remembers that workers have
families to su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ort. He say's: "If the worker receives a wage on
which he can su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ort himself, his wife, and his children
becomingly, he will be able to save and to have a small ca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ital."
He is to buy land (as that will kee<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> him out of Socialism). I have
em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hasized the significant word in this <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assage, as the Catholic
translators again <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lay tricks with it. And if the reader finds my
translation of it ambiguous I re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ly that it is deliberately
ambiguous in the original. The Latin here is <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oor and unusual --
just for the sake of vagueness. As a matter of fact the official
clerical biogra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>her of <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent>, Msgr. T'Serelaes, says that the
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s references to a living wage led everywhere to stormy
dis<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>utes as to what <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>recisely he meant, and a Belgian archbisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>
wrote to Rome for a clarification of them. He got none. So we may
dismiss the gems of social wisdom of <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent> and the dishonest
comments of American a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists who tam<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>er with the text and
conceal the fact that through one of the Congregations of
Cardinals, of which the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> is the head, <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent> in 1902 recanted

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   According to these a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent>'s "Immortal" utterance
remained the Roman standard on such matters until 1931, when Pius
XI, in the encyclical Quadragestme anno re-affirmed and develo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed
its teaching; and these two declarations are the wisest and
soundest of all counsels on the great issue of Ca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ital and Labor.
But, as I have already said, while these a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists talk very
fulsomely about the encyclical of 1931 they, as far as I can
discover never translate it. There is certainly no translation
issued by the British Catholic authorities and I cannot trace any
in America, though the essential meaning of an "encyclical" letter
is that it is addressed to the whole Catholic world, and the
hierarchy in each country is to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublish a translation of it. Dr.
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Ryan</ent>, the Catholic oracle on social questions, translated all the
earlier encyclicals of Pius XI but did not touch this one.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lained in an earlier booklet why this "great" encyclical
is so scurvily treated by Catholics and was almost ignored by the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress. It tells Catholics that the cor<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orative state -- Fascism, in
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lain English -- is the true model in economic matters and must be
enforced when the authorities are Catholics! I will again give a
faithful summary of it, but first let us get the true historical
framework.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   There was not, as the a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologist's claim, a continuity of Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy. There was exactly the o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osite. Not only did Rome, as I
have said, formally reverse its <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy, but that <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy had so
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ably failed that the three <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>s</ent> who followed <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent> never
endorsed it. I have shown elsewhere that the Church of Rome
continued to lose to the Socialists. In Germany the Socialist vote,
which had risen to 1,427,298 in 1890 had increased to 2,107,076 by
1898; and it was chiefly in Germany that the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> had ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ected good
results from his encyclical. In France the number of Socialists
doubled between 1893 and 1900. In Austria the vote rose from
750,000 in 1890 to 1,041,948 in 1907. And Socialism began to s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>read
in Italy itself. The vote rose from 27,000 in 1892 to 175,000 in
1900. The Church, losing heavily, continued to denounce Socialism
and to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ermit local churches to ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriment in Christian Socialism,
as we shall see later. Then came the war, the Russian Revolution,
and the ra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>id s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>read of Atheistic Communism as well as Socialism,</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The des<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erate officials at the Vatican learned, however, as
time went on that the modern world was not necessarily committed to
radical and democratic <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rinci<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>les. A very large <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortion of the
middle class as well as the wealthy were alarmed at the threat to
"<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivate enter<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rise," or the chance of making a fortune, and, while
these men had in the 19th Century <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovided the backbone of the
anti-clerical <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arty everywhere, they now sought clerical as well as
conservative allies against Bolshevism. To win a good su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ort in
the working class they joined in the cry that Bolshevism set out to
destroy religion, and therefore threatened civilization, and their
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress echoed the libels against and grossly misre<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resented Russia.
So there was formed the grand anti-Bolshevik alliance of ministers
and morons, bankers and bandits, journalists, and Jesuits all over
the world. The Vatican dro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed its coquetting with Russia and, as
we saw in the first series, entered into a brazen alliance with the
gangs of criminals who were the nucleus grou<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s of the next
movement.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   So you know what to ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ect of an encyclical on the workers
com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osed by the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resent aristocratic <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>, who was then Secretary
of State, in 1931. "Quadragesimo anno" means "in the fortieth year"
(since <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent>'s encyclical), and is really an amazing, suggestion of
continuity of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy. The <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> recalls the work of <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent>. There was
vast and increasing misery amongst the workers -- in the leading
countries they had, as a matter of fact, had their real wage
doubled or trebled in half a century -- and "the eyes of all were
turned to the Chair of Peter." <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> issued his marvelous encyclical,
which "owed nothing to either Liberalism or Socialism" -- its best
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oints were, we saw, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>latitudes of benevolent Liberalism -- but was
ins<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ired by the genius of the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> and Catholic teaching. The world
was "stu<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>efied at the novelty of his teaching," which "overthrew
all the idols of Liberalism," and the message <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roduced the most
salutary fruits everywhere. These Liberals had done a little for
the workers, It is true, but it was the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s encyclical that the
workers had to thank for all the social legislation that was <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assed
after 1891 and for the full establishment of Trade Unions, which
the Liberals had o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osed.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   After devoting a quarter of the long letter to this childish
theme the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> says that he is going to develo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent>'s <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rinci<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>les.
He does not even hint at the retraction. At great length he <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roves
that the right of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivate ownershi<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> is based on moral <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rinci<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>les,
so Socialism is immoral. "No good Catholic can be a good
Socialist." As to Communism it is beneath discussion. Ca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ital and
Labor are equally indis<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ensable, and the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roduct must be "justly"
divided; but he does not go a ste<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> beyond <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> in defining what a
"just wage" is. The workers must have unions, but there must be no
class-war, and in view of the need for harmonious coo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eration a new
ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e of union or "syndicate" which has lately a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eared deserves
attention. There must be unions of both workers and em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyers and
conferences of delegates from each side. The worker is quite free
to belong or not belong to the syndicate, but he has to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ay the
fees in any case. The <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>, who has the Italian model before him,
omits to say that if a worker does not join the union he will get
no labor-ticket. Strikes are forbidden, and if the two sides cannot
agree the government must intervene. But if they will all join the
Catholic Church and reform their morals the machine will march on
oiled wheels.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   In other words, <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent>'s Cor<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orative State is the ideal,
and from Slovakia to Peru the new Catholic countries are ado<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ting
it and ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ressly quoting this encyclical as the reason. Did or did
not the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> know that <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> devised this economic structure
sim<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ly in order to have both industrialists and workers in his
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower when the time came for war-industries and forced loans?
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Obtuse</ent> as the Vatican is in such matters the clergy must have knows
this, and must have known also that, while the industrialists
really suffered in the matter of forced loans to the government the
workers were enslaved and im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>overished. So now you know why, though
Catholic a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists in America insist that the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al encyclicals
are the grand Charters of Labor they are so very reticent about

with a summary of social history which was as near to the truth as

of Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ean history to Catholics who are not allowed to read the

read, and give in their writings sufficient <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roof that they have
read, ordinary ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ert works on the history of the struggle of the

truth he might not be able to write those sonorous and va<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>id
generalizations which Catholics mistake for dee<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> or ins<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ired
thought. In the next book we shall see some of these highly-
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oisoned gems of historical fiction from an earlier encyclical of
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent>. He writes history (and economics) like a devout nun. The
workers, we found him saying, were ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>y and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ros<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erous under the
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>gilds</ent>, which the Church had ins<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ired, until the French Revolution.
Then "irreligion" made the world of em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyers callous and brutal.
Nothing was substituted for the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotection of the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>gilds</ent>, and. ...
Well there you are. That is why the workers of the last century
were so ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loited. You have only to bring back the em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyers to the
true Church (as in that country which I described in the first
cha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ter) and the world of Labor will take on the brightness and
warmth of a garden in s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ring.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Exce<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t for the howler about the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>gilds</ent> this is really what
Catholic a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists commonly say on the subject. The Church "broke
the fetters of the slave" and brought light and justice to the
workers of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>agan world. In due time -- five or six centuries
later -- it created the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>gilds</ent> which s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>read a rich religious mantle
of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotection over the workers of Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e. Protestantism destroyed
the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotection -- the little difficulty about what ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ened in the
Catholic half of Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e may (and had better be) disregarded -- and
so the arrival of the Industrial Era found them the hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>less <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rey
of the ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loiters. The world must return to the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rinci<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>les of the
Middle Ages when the workers were so ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>y.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The real record of the Church in relation to the workers can
be summed u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> even more shortly than that, for it is much nearer to
the truth to say that the Church was com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rehensively indifferent to
the condition of the workers from the time it won <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower until <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent>
wrote his "great" Charter of their Rights. That condition varied

French Revolution it was one of galling subjection and
ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loitation, and the Church never condemned this. It is a long
story for a short cha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ter, but I may <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint out the fallacy or the
untruth of the chief statements on which the claim of the a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologist
is based. And if I have here to be very brief and rather dogmatic
it may be advisable to ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lain to some of my readers that I have
dealt with these <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oints and given the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>er authorities in several

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Catholic writers used to boast how the Church was communistic
and anti-rich from its infancy, but they have done their best
recently to make the word Communism stink in folk's nostrils so
they dro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> this argument. It would be as bad as boasting how
Catholic commercial travelers, or their medieval equivalent, used
to lock their wives in "girdles of chastity" when they set out on
their rounds. In any case it is false. The theory is based u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on a
statement about one <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>articular church in Acts, which even many
theologians consider a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ious romance. <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Paul</ent>'s letters are the
earliest documents, and they reflect a division of classes, with
rich slave-owners and even im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erial officials. In fact Catholic
literature includes wealthy relatives of the Em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eror Ves<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>asian in
the Roman Church.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   More im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortant is the claim about slavery; and let me say at
once that it is one of the most blatantly untruthful claims the
a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists make. No <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>, no Father of the Church, no body of
churchmen ever condemned slavery until the 18th Century. St.
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Augustine</ent>, the dominant oracle of western or Roman Christendom,
ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ressly defended it as of divine a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ointment (City of God, Book
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>XlX</ent>, eh. XV), and <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Thomas Aquinas</ent> and all the other Schoolmen
followed <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Augustine</ent>. There is not an ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ert work on the subject that
does not ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lain that the old ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e of slavery was destroyed by the
economic colla<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>se of the Roman Em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ire, and that before that time
Roman moralists and Em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erors had done a great deal for the slave.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   After the year 500 the workers of Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e are called in our
modern literature "serfs," but the reader is rarely warned that
still for centuries all literature was Latin, and there are not
different words in Latin for "slave" and "serf." The workers were
-- and the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>s</ent> from 600 onward owned vast numbers of them -- just
servi as they had been under <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aganism, and <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Vinogradov</ent>, one of the
best historical sociologists of recent times, says that they were
in law and fact, "slaves." They were bought and sold like cattle,
and no law <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotected them from cruelty. So the only real change
when the Roman Church came to dominate Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e in the 5th Century
was that, whereas in the Roman Em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ire, two workers out of three had
been free (See Darrow's Slavery in the Roman Em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ire), literate, and
almost <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>am<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ered, in the new Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e not one worker in ten was free
or literate or had a life of elementary comfort and decency.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   This "era of the serfs" lasted until the 12th or 13th Century,
when the majority were emanci<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ated. Again there is no modern ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ert
who does not trace this emanci<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ation to what we may broadly call
economic causes. The nobles sold freedom to immense bodies of serfs
so that they could go on the looting ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>editions of the Crusaders
or enjoy the more luxurious life which Arabs had taught Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e.
Kings emanci<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ated bodies of serfs to hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> fight their rebellious
nobles: nobles emanci<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ated them to fight the kings or other nobles.
Abbeys and bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s were, says the Catholic historian <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Muratori</ent>, the
last to emanci<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ate them, saying that they must not "alienate Church
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erty." At the same time Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e was ra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>idly recovering
economically and far larger bodies of craftsman were required in
the towns (which, for the same reasons, now got charters of
liberty).</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The famous <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>gilds</ent> had begun long before this, and the Church,
instead of having ins<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ired them, tried for more than a century to
su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress them. They seem to have been formed by the workers on the
model of the unions (colleges) of the old Greek and Roman workers,
traces of which survived. I have elsewhere quoted decrees from the
Ca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>itularies of Charlemagne and later Church Councils showing how
drastically the Church condemned them. It could not su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress so it
a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riated them, and for several centuries they certainly hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed
the workers. That is to say, the skilled workers. Writers on the
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>gilds</ent> (Gross, <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Walford</ent>, etc.) do not remind the reader that while in
the towns even the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rostitutes had <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>gilds</ent> and walked in the sacred
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rocessions (of course, the writers I have named do not tell this),
the agricultural workers, who were at least four-fifths of the
workers of Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e, had none or any other kind of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotection.
Further, every single real ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ert on any country in Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e during
this <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriod, the so-called Age of Chivalry, the best <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art of the
Middle Ages (1100 to 1400), agrees that the lords and landowners
regarded the workers as dirt under their feet, robbing and
torturing them barbarously. It was an age of wild license, of
fiendish cruelty, and you can imagine -- or read Eccardus for
Germany, <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Brissot</ent> for France, and <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Thorold Rogers</ent> or Traile for
England, the chief authorities on the workers -- how the unarmed
mass of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le fared.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   All the leading historical ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erts on the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriod use the same
language as Professor A. <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Luchaire</ent>, the highest authority on France
in the 13th Century. He says (Social France at the Time of Phili<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e
Auguste) that "feudalism seemed to take a ferocious delight in
seeing flames consume burgher's house's and the villains [workers]
who lived in them" (<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>. 5); that the knight or noble "was almost
everywhere a brutal and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>illaging soldier" (<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>. 249); and that "the
noble had an untameable anti<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>athy to and a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofound contem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t of the
villain: that is, for the serf, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>easant, laborer, citizen, or
burgher" (<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>. 271). Such was France, the most advanced country in
Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e, in what Catholics call the most beautiful <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art of the
Middle Ages; and every leading authority on Italy, England, or
Germany at the time gives exactly the same <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>icture. <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent>
had as naive an idea of the time as has the schoolma'am who talks
to her class about the beautiful Age of Chivalry and the Knights
Errant. And in our age of historical scholarshi<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> this sort of thing
is solemnly made the basis of a social argument by the s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>iritual
leaders of 200,000,000 folk and is most res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ectfully treated by
editorial writers and essayists.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It would be <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ertinent to show that while the workers who were
subject to the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> were thus as un<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotected from the brutality of
their "betters" as the slaves of old -- indeed less than the slaves
of Rome from the time of the Em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eror <ent type = 'person'>Hadrian</ent> -- and lived for the
most <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art (on the land) in sordid and brutalizing conditions, the
workers of Arab S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain, who cannot have been far short in number of
the workers of the whole of Christian Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e, were relatively ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>y
and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ros<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erous and generally educated. But I cannot enlarge on that
in this little sketch. Let me just say, on the strength of the
research and the general consensus of authorities in ancient Rome,
medieval Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e, and Arab S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain which I give in a dozen works, that

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>between their good condition in the Roman Em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ire and the
im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovements they have won in modern times. None but Catholic
a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists and a few American teachers of history who <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lay u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> to
them now write such trash about the Middle Ages. The <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriod had
great art, but four-fifth's of the workers, scattered outside the
cities, never even saw this.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It is true that the condition of the growing body of
industrial workers became harder in some res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ects after the
Reformation. The a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists make a ridiculous attem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t to connect
this with (at least in England) the su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ression of the monasteries,
the chief effect of which for the workers was that crowds of men
and women who had idly hung about the fat monasteries for food
instead of working for it had now the choice of working or
starving. In <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint of fact Protestant England set u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> a system of
Poor Relief which, crude as it was -- like most government measures
300 years ago -- did discriminate to some extent between "sturdy
beggars" and the real needy.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   But the answer to any Catholic attem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t to make ca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ital out of
the fact that, as trade and industry ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anded, the lawyers, in the
interest of the rich, made the law harsher against the workers,
es<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecially in regard to unions, is easily found when we com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>are
Catholic and Protestant countries. The three countries of Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e
which sank most notably from the best level of the Middle Ages
after the Reformation were beyond any question Catholic Italy,
S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain, and Portugal. There the lot of the worker fell to the level
at which we found it in the first cha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ter and remained at that
level until our time. The exce<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tions only strengthen my <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint. When
anti-Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al statesmen took over Italy from the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> and his <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ets
at Na<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>les the status of the workers began to rise -- until
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> shared his <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower with the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>. In S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain and Portugal
also there were <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriods of anti-clerical Liberalism or (1932-6)
Socialism during which the condition of the workers was im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roved
and schools for their children were o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ened. Under the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resent
Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al-Fascist regime they have fallen back toward a condition of
ill-<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aid illiterate serfdom. These are <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>latitude's of socio-
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olitical history.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I have not s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>okes of France because it did not, like Italy,
S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain, and Portugal, build round itself a Chinese Wall to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotect
its Catholic <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulation from the taint of non-Catholic influences.
It was o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>en to receive ideas from England, Holland, and Germany,
and it saw a considerable growth of ske<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ticism. Even its clergy
were remarkably inde<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>endent of Rome. Yet it remained <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>redominantly
Catholic, and it retained medieval vices (torture's, etc.) in
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortion to its Catholicism. Here I have to notice only the
condition of the workers. There is no dis<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ute about it. A<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists
find a second Catholic Golden Age in the days of <ent type = 'person'><ent type = 'person'>Louis</ent> XIV</ent>: a
vicious, selfish, scandalous monarch who regarded the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le only
as a source of wealth for his corru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t court, if you read French try
to see the documents in Martin's authoritative history relating to
the a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>alling condition of the agricultural workers when <ent type = 'person'>Louis</ent> was
building his <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>alaces. <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Brissot</ent>, the chief French authority on the
history of the workers, shows that the wage even of the skilled
workers fell under <ent type = 'person'><ent type = 'person'>Louis</ent> XIV</ent> to about 38 cents a day (of 12 to 14
hours) and the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rice of food rose.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   But their condition on the eve of the Revolution is well
known, and it is equally well known -- in fact eagerly claimed by
a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists who know as little about the French Revolution as they
do about the Russian -- that anti-clericals educated the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>
to and ins<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ired that inauguration of the first attem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t in
Christendom to redeem and u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lift the workers. Peo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le will not
understand our own time unless they see that we still live in the
new age, an age of struggle against <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivilege for freedom,
democracy, enlightenment, and justice to the workers, which o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ened
at the French Revolution; in a sense you might say the American
Revolution, since it was in some res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ects more than <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olitical
though in just these res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ects its roots were in French anti-Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al
literature.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I ho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e some day to write a worthy history of this <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriod.
Already for 150 years men and women, touched by the vision of a
wiser and juster social order, have fought for freedom, justice,
and enlightenment. A million of them have lost their lives in the
struggle, yet but for the rousing of Russia the race in most
countries would have lost all that it had won in those 150 years of
sweat and blood. Even now that victory is certain in the sense that
the nests of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>irates in Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo will be destroyed
the race makes no totalitarian war against them because so few
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le understand the struggle in all its range. The coalition of
the Roman Church with the bandits is concealed from the majority --
I just received a letter from a distinguished clergyman, no lover
of Rome, who writes that I will startle England if I can <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rove that
connection! -- whereas, if you know the whole <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriod, it is the
logical and almost inevitable <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy of the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>acy. And with so
much hidden and the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ers<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ective distorted some of the leaders in
the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resent fight, men who mouth about freedom and democracy, ho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e
to save the Roman Church from chastisement or loss of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower because
it will hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut kings back on their thrones, restore <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivilege,
and cheek the as<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>irations of the workers.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I have tried in all my works for the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ast ten years to get
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le to see the events of contem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orary life in this historical
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ers<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ective, but I must here confine myself to the question of the
workers. The French Revolution <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roved a false dawn of the new age,
and when it and the com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>romise of the Na<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oleonic regime were
destroyed the fight had to begin again, under a dense cloud of
reaction. Let us say that the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriod from about 1830 to 1930 was
one of increasing victory for the worker's. The real wage in the
larger lndustrialized states was trebled. Universal free education
was won, and this meant at all events the erection of a ladder by
which the abler workers might ascend to a higher level. Immense
social services -- hygienic, medical, recreational, educative, and
financial -- were <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovided. The right to unions was almost
com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>letely established. It all fell far short of the ideal, but let
us be just. That age which the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> blandly blames for all that is
wrong, which he re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resents as undoing the justice won for the
workers in earlier Catholic ages was one of the most <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rogressive
that the world had yet seen; for the workers of im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erial Rome had
not had to fight for such <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivileges as they had.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Well, what share has the Church of Rome had in the victorious
struggle? Should we be far away from the historical truth if we 
said, None? A<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists search the darker lanes of recent history
for some obscure <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest or layman -- generally in bad odor in his
Church at the time -- who dared to say a word for the im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovement
of the condition of the workers, for the emanci<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ation of the
Slaves, for justice to women, and so on. That neither the Vatican
nor any national branch of the Church joined in the great word
until the last decade of the 19th Century, when wholesale a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ostasy
of the workers alarmed the Black International, they have to grant.
But this thimble-rigging game of claiming the credit for "the
Church" when one man is honest and asking us to blame "not the
Church but the individual" when a hundred are dishonest begins to
be resented even by the Catholic laity.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I made a broad examination of the mighty cam<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aign for reform
-- which means to rid the world finally of medievalism -- during
the last 150 years in my recent 'How Freethinkers made Notable
Contributions to Civilization' (1938). I showed that in <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriods
when Catholics regarded Freethinkers as an insignificant and
negligible minority they <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovided the great majority of the leaders
in every branch of the reform-movement. A Catholic survey of that
magnificent fight for man, the grandest of all e<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ics, naming all
Catholics in Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e or America who made any such notable
contribution would be a farce, yet all the time the Church was
boasting that it ruled a third of the white race. Even the men who
are claimed, like the Chartist leader in England Bronterre O'Brien,
were a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ostates in most cases.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Or take, as we have done before, the contrast of Catholic and
Protestant lands. In the first cha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ter I distributed countries, as
they were before the war threw everything into confusion, into
three grou<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s. I do not imagine that any student of social matters
will question the general distribution, and quarrels about the
exact <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition of this or that country do not affect the
conclusion. The workers enjoy the best conditions where Catholicism
has no influence on <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublic life and the worst conditions where it
has its greatest influence. They are worst <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aid and least <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotected
by law, and have the feeblest social services in the lands where
the ruling class <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofess docility to the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>. In Russia, where
Catholicism sim<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ly does not exist, the workers have the finest
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition they ever had in history, and they were ra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>idly advancing,
when the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s war against them broke out, to a level higher than
is or ever was, found in any other civilization. Whether you agree
to that or no the broad truth remains; the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition of the workers
rose in <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortion as Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al influence fell. I wonder if there is
any normally-minded Catholic worker in America who will question my
distribution of the leading countries of the world according to the
status of the workers and the Catholic element in the country, or
will claim that his Church has anything to do with the high
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition, from material and historical reasons, of the workers of
America. Yet these Catholic workers cannot o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>en one of their books
on social questions without reading that the two encyclicals I
analyzed show the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>s</ent> as the beat friends of Labor.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   In other words, we have in this controversy, as in so many
others that concern the Church, all the facts on one side and all 
the rhetoric on the other. The Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al encyclicals are not merely
rhetoric but <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>latitudinous rhetoric. That of <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent> in those
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assages of it which won most attention just took u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> and, with a
certain amount of vagueness, re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eated demands which had for decades
been considered elementary in serious discussions of such matters.
Was there, in fact, on the ca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>italist side any res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>onsible writer
who said that "overwork was just as long as you did not s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecify the
hours for any industry" -- at that time the burning question, which
the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> carefully avoided, was the eight-hour day -- or who
questioned that the worker had a right to a decent wage as long as
you refused to say what in any industry a decent wage was? And the
second Encyclical officially took back the slight concessions --
already quietly withdrawn -- of the first because it <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut the
workers under a Cor<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orative State, in which any demands of theirs
are finally settled by the em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyer's or the government. Both
encyclicals, moreover, lay heavy stress on something which is
anathema to every social student. They say that the rich justify
the larger share they take of the wealth <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roduced if they give
generously in charity to the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oor.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   If the a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologist falls back, as he usually does, u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on the fact
that the Church has always sternly insisted on justice his case is
worse than ever. Such <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>reaching is, and always was, barren. There
is a Catholic church in New York which the Tammany leaders have
attended for the last 100 years, and the services and sermons have
s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oken of justice as often as they did in other cha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>els. Under the
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s nose, in Italy, Catholic em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyers made the vilest use, in
the sul<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hur mines, of child labor that you would find anywhere in
Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e. Almost as sordid a use of child labor was made in the
tailoring business in Poland, and in agriculture and various
industries in S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain, Portugal, and South America. So it has been
for ages, though the em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyers listened Sunday after Sunday to the
Catholic gos<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>el of justice. The ethic has been the same in all
ages; the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ractice has varied considerably, and the facts I have
given even in this short sketch show that the actual treatment of
the workers was always nearest to the ideal of justice where <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublic
life was influenced by those whom the Church denounced.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I have found it necessary at this <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint to make a few
excursions into older history because it was im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ossible to ignore
the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s amazing statement that the workers enjoyed ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ier
conditions when the world was Catholic and that their modern
grievances are due to the colla<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>se of Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al authority over a large
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art of the earth. How Catholics tolerate such howlers and then
res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ectfully read articles in their <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress about the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofound wisdom
and sagacity of the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>s</ent> is the one <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roblem of Church life I have
never mastered. But let me remind the reader that this discussion
of the status of the workers is <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art of a broader study of the
Roman Church which we are making. The starting-<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint of it was:
What is the real nature of the Church of Rome, of the Black

.  THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>with the vilest forces of modern times? One of the difficulties of
the general <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublic in entertaining this is that for 40 years
Catholic a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologetic works in America have loudly boasted that their
Church has always been, and es<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecially in Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al declarations during
the last half-century, the cham<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ion of Labor against greed. We have
seen that it was, on the contrary, always in alliance with wealth
and greed and is in its <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resent alliances merely <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ursuing its
normal <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I imagine that after the war, when Socialism and Communism
s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>read once more, what is left of the Catholic Church will to a
great extent turn to what is called Christian Socialism, and we may
glance at it. The movement was, of course, never Socialistic, and
in so far as it was ado<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ted in Catholic countries, it never used
the word Socialism. It was called Christian or Catholic Democracy
or Social Party, and its ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ur<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ose was to divert the workers
from Socialism, which <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent> condemned as em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hatically in 1891 as
Pius XI did in 1931. The movement began in England in 1849 when
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le still distinguished between the state Socialism of <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Marx</ent>,
which then had few adherents in Britain, and other varieties such
as Robert <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Owen</ent>'s voluntary Socialism.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   This British movement, founded by two clergymen of the Church
of England, <ent type = 'person'>Charles Kingsley</ent> and F.D. <ent type = 'person'>Maurice</ent>, assisted by the
barrister (of the same Church) <ent type = 'person'>Ludlow</ent>, which borrowed the title
Socialism as it was loosely used by the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Owen</ent>ites, never had a large
body of adherents and did not last long. <ent type = 'person'>Ludlow</ent> admitted that its
chief aim was "to Christianize Socialism," or to show the workers
that they need not leave the Church because they demanded a
betterment of their condition. But it was a grou<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> of men and women
who very sincerely felt that something must be done for the workers
when the Chartist movement so sensationally colla<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>sed in 1848 and
it did render material services in education and in hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ing Trade
Unions and Coo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erative Societies. It was continued in the Guild of
St. Matthew, which was closely associated with the "High" or
Ritualist branch of the Church, and there was a less advanced
Christian Social Union.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I once took the chair for a lecture by the Rev. Stewart
Headlam head of the Guild of St. Matthew, and the audience numbered
30 or 40. When we si<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed a whisky and soda together afterwards he
said that he had given this eloquent lecture on "The Brotherhood of
Men under the Fatherhood of God" a score of times and got almost no
res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>onse. Why? I discreetly reminded him that the Church had taught
the Fatherhood of God just as dogmatically in the long ages of
tyranny and ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loitation and suggested that <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s the em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyers
reflected that since the Father condemned his children to an
eternal hell the little hell they gave their workers sometimes did
not matter much.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I need not trace the echoes of this movement in the religious
world of America -- the Christian Labor Union of 1872, the Knights
of Labor, the Christian Social Union, etc. -- as Catholics were not
involved in them. It was in Germany, after 1870, that the movement
which we generally call Christian Socialism s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>read amongst the
Catholic worker's. It was, of course, not merely not Socialism but
the very o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osite of it, since the sole aim was to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>revent Catholic</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>workers from joining the Social Democrats. The whole movement, in
Britain, America, and Germany, rather reminds us of the clergymen
who try to kee<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> their young men and girls from wicked dance-halls
by arranging chaste dances or <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ing-<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ong games, with non-alcoholic
refreshments, in the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arish hall.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It was more serious and more resolutely Catholic when it
s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>read to Austria. Its a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riation of the name Socialism was in
this case <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eculiarly ironical. Not only had it no sincere <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rogram
of im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovement of the condition of the workers but it at first
consisted of violently anti-Socialist middle-class men, and it soon
absorbed the Conservative body of Catholics. The urban workers,
es<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecially at Vienna, were too well read in social history to be
du<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed by the romantic version of the Church's attitude to Labor
that the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests offered them and, as is well known, they <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assed
bodily to Socialism and in free elections won com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lete <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower over
Vienna and a few other towns year after year. It was <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>articularly
exas<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erating for the Church because the Austrian workers were so
well behaved that it was in this case im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ossible to fabricate
stories of "Red atrocities." I s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ent a week amongst them at the
time when the de<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ression and the mutilation of the country by
Versailles had brought u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on Vienna such economic stringency that,
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olice-officials assured me, the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>atience of the workers was
strained to breaking <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint. I saw 10,000 armed <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olice drawn across
a short section of the Ring between the rich inner city and an
industrial suburb. But not a clash occurred, though I verified that
half the workers suffered grave <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivation.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It was therefore the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy of the church to hold the ignorant
and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest-ridden agricultural workers, which would ensure its
control of the national government and so give it, in case of need,
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower over the Socialist munici<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al governments. The title
"Socialist" became farcical when the Catholic nobles and land-
owners were enlisted in the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arty and their influence over the
rural <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulation secured, so we need not <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ay any attention to the
few ameliorative measures, such as agricultural coo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eratives, which
they <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assed. But the story, as it develo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed, is so characteristic
of Vatican strategy that it is vitally relevant to the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint we
are. considering.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   In the stress of the terrible ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriences of 1918 and 1919 the
so-called Christian Socialists coo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erated amiably with the Social
Democrats in reconstituting the beggared Austrian state on a
democratic basis, and then for a time they became, with this
immense rural backing, the chief <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arty in the country. It was led
by a clerical <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofessor, Sei<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>el, whose <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition was much the same
as that of Dr. <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Ryan</ent> in the American Church. But with the ca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ture of
the national government by the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arty it suited the Vatican to
forget that churchmen must not interfere in <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olities -- as a matter
of fact the Church never sacrifices a single o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortunity to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut a
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest at the head of a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olitical <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arty -- and Sel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>el became
Chancellor of the Austrian Re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublic and brought his <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arty back to
the old bitter hostility to the Social Democrats.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The situation that immediately ensued was falsely re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resented,
as all Socialist constructive work was in the world-<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress and by
the Church, but historians of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriod have made it clear. While

work for the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le (es<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecially in education and re-housing) that
an editorial in a Liberal London <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>er, the News-Chronicle
(February 12. 1935) <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ronounced it "as close to the ideal Platonic
Re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublic as the world has ever seen." I may recall that the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resent
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>, who re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resented the Vatican in Germany for 12 years, was
familiar with all this, yet in the encyclical Quadragesimo anno,
which he issued in the name of the late <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>, he dwelt on the
futility and danger to civilization of Socialism in the usual
Catholic manner.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Rome has only one effective answer in such cases, violence,
and in an earlier booklet of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ast series I told what ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ened.
The Christian Socialist government, led by the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest-ridden and
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>iously unscru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulous <ent type = 'person'>Dollfuss</ent>, allied itself with the Fascists and
destroyed Social Democracy. It was the time when <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> was
su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osed to leave Austria in <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent>'s s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>here of influence, and
the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al encyclical of 1931 ordered Catholics, in effect, to ado<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t
the cor<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orative state. As <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> made <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublic his real <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lans and his

Greater Germany movement; and, when the trium<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>h of the Nazis was
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut beyond question the head of the Austrian Church, Cardinal
Innitzer, threw off the mask and delivered the country to the Beast
of Berchtesgaden. The long, and heroic struggle of the Austrian
workers was over. They <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assed under the vile tyranny of the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s
ideal cor<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orative state and the Gesta<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Not less instructive is the develo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ment in Italy. Socialism
began to grow ra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>idly in that country in the last decade of the
19th Century. The situation here was <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eculiar because the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>s</ent>
had, since the Italian government had taken over the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al States,
forbidden Catholics to take any <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art in national <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oliticks. <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent>
XIII had <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ermitted them to enter munici<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al Polities and in 1905 the
sagacious Vatican was forced to acknowledge its blunder and remove
the ban altogether. <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> had, we saw, sourly ordered Italian
Catholics in 1902 to dro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> all concern about the living wage and
industrial betterment and concentrate on the recovery of the
Tem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oral Power. The removal of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olitical ban reo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ened the
question of social activity, and a Peo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le's Party, a variant of
Christian Socialism, was established. Led by the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest <ent type = 'person'>Murri</ent>, it
was violently anti-Socialist -- see his work Battaglie d'Oggi --

could do this only by making concessions to the reform-<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rogram, and
under a new <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest-leader, <ent type = 'person'>Luigi Sturzo</ent>, it became less and less
ecclesiastical and more exigent in its demands for the workers.
Then came the rise of Fascism and the s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>irited fight of the
Fascists against the Socialists and Communists. Large numbers of
the Catholic <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arty joined the Fascists -- one of them was in
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent>'s first cabinet -- since they understood that the
Church's <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rimary object was the destruction of Socialism, and
hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut the <ent type = 'person'>Duce</ent> on the throne. The Vatican followed its
usual <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy of having re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resentatives in both cam<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s as long as the
issue was doubtful.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   <ent type = 'person'>Seldes</ent> describes the situation in his work 'The Vatican,'
which is so lenient to Rome that I at first mistook its author for
a Catholic. In 1922 and 1923 the Catholic <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>easants of the Union
cracked Fascist skulls even more than the Socialists and Communists
did in the daily fights. The struggle continued as fiercely as ever
although <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> seized <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower in 1922. We are again reminded of
the real usur<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ation of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower by <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> and <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> who never won
more than a minority of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le in free elections. Fascism in
Italy was far outnumbered by the Catholic, Liberal, Socialist, and
Communist o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition. And we are equally reminded of the evil
wrought by the Vatican, <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> sent envoys to it with a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>romise
to make concessions to the Church if the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> would condemn the
Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ular Party. Alternatively he threatened Church <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erty if the
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> did not. So in June 1923 the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> acted. Sturzo resigned his
leadershi<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> of the Party on the ground that <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests must not
interfere in <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olitics and retired to a monastery. The Party lost
ground, and at the final reconciliation of <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> with the
Church and his rich reward of it for its services it was entirely
sacrificed. The workers of Italy, who had fought for their rights
for 140 years and sacrificed hundreds of thousands of lives <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assed,
with the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s solemn blessing, into the ignoble slavery of the
Cor<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orative State.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It will now be a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arent why, in s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ite of the tragic features
of the story, I s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eak of the Comedy of Christian Socialism. or
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>revent its growth by luring workers to stay at a half-way house in
that direction, and in most forms it was bitterly o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osed to
Socialism. This is so far acknowledged that in most forms it
avoided the title Socialist and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>referred Social Union or Christian
Democracy; but if any reader is inclined to suggest on that account
that I have no right to include these Catholic and Protestant
movements under the title Christian Socialism let him consult, for
instance, so authoritative a work as The Encyclo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>edia of the Social
Sciences.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   In s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eaking of comedy, however, I am thinking of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy of
the Vatican in its occasional use of the movement. <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent>
discovers in the twentieth year of his <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ontificate that Liberalism
has ruined the excellent status of the workers which his Church had
secured. That is comic enough, as I ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lained it is still more
ridiculous in the eye of any serious student of such matters
because he knows that as long as the mass of the workers were
uneducated it was mainly left to middle-class Liberals to win the
first installments of justice for them. Even Socialist writers </<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>often call the middle half of the 19th Century the Age of the
Benevolent Bourgeois. Irony a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art, not only were great Socialist
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ioneers like <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Marx</ent>, Engels, and Lasalle, middle-class men but there
is a very honorable list of Liberals in the fight -- the fight
against the Conservatives and the Churches -- to liberate the
workers from their medieval bondage. In England for instance, it
was middle-class Liberals like <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Owen</ent>, <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Place</ent>, Bentham, Brougham, etc.
-- who won education, shorter hours, and less ghastly working
conditions for them.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It was the rise of Socialism and the threat to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivate
enter<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rise which caused the Liberals to raise the cry (as
shibboleth) that we must have "evolution not revolution" and
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ose reform by installments. In other words, they invented the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rogram of moderate industrial reforms -- a living wage, shorter
hours, factory and worksho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> ins<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ection, weekly rest and occasional
holidays, etc. -- which the Christian Socialists took over. What is
more amusing is that it was just this <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rogram which the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> took
over from the Liberals, whom he heavily censured for their
wickedness to the workers, in 1891. The three <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oints of his Charter
were common<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>laces of Liberal literature by that time, and the
better Liberals had got beyond them and were demanding or favoring
schemes of insurance, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ensions, and so on.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   But the ignorance of the literature of the subject dis<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>layed
in these Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al Encyclicals is well known to students of these
matters. What is of more interest here is that American Catholic
a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists are still substantially in the stage of <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent> and
still quote his encyclical as a grand revolutionary utterance. The
whole "social welfare" movement of the American Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al Church has
the same aim as <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> had, to distract men from Socialism or to kee<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>
u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> the working-class membershi<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> of the Church, and, though some of
its writers go farther than others, if there is anything like an
agreed body of teaching endorsed by the bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s it certainly does
not go beyond advanced Liberalism. It is now quite common for
writers who are Liberals even in the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olitical sense to say that
the age of Lassez-faire is over and the state must interfere in the
interest of the workers, but <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>s</ent> and American Catholic writers on
social questions talk as if they had not noticed the develo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ments
of the last quarter of a century.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The broad <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lea of the a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists, when they are confronting
the workers and not <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>reaching to their richer congregations, is
that the Church in its wisdom has established the truth midway,
between Liberalism and Socialism. I need not s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eak here of
<ent type = 'person'>Coughlin</ent>, who does not re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resent the Church and will be disowned
whenever it becomes ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>edient. The general <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition is that
Liberalism does not go far enough while Socialism goes too far. It
enhances the comic as<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ect of the situation if you examine the
grounds on which they o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ose Socialism. With a dry medieval
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>edantry that must equally amuse the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofessor of ethics and the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofessor of economics they <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rove by elaborate arguments that the
right of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivate ownershi<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> is asserted by "natural moral law," of
which God is the author, so Socialists who deny it are sinful or
immoral. It is like chewing sawdust and has as much relation to the
actual <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roblems of life as have arguments for a flat earth. You
would hardly ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ect verbal camouflage of this sort to hide even
from a so<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>homore the fact that Rome really hates Socialism because </<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>freethinking generally accom<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anies it and because the use of the
Church's international machinery to check the growth of Socialism
kee<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s it in alliance with the rich, the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivileged and the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>owerful. The Catholic <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition never was between Liberalism and
Socialism, but Rome found it ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>edient to let bodies of Catholics
take u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition between Liberalism and com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lete reaction.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The irony is now com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lete. The Church swings back to reaction
under the im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ression that it is going to recover world-<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower and
leaves the American a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists looking very foolish as they still
chant the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>raises of the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al Charters of Labor. It was <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ossible
to conceal from the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublic the way in which <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent> XIII</ent> em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hatically
withdrew his Charter of the Rights of the Workers. This was done in
a letter to the bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests of Italy, and the foreign
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress, which had been enthusiastic about <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Leo</ent>'s "revolutionary"
utterance in 1891, would offend Catholics if it noticed the
retraction of 1902. The same attem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t was made to kee<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> the American
(and British) <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublic unaware of the really revolutionary encyclical
of 1931, in which Catholic workers are told that they must join
syndicates or cor<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orations which are overshadowed by cor<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orations
of the em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyers and drastically subject to the state, which will
not <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ermit strikes. I have read French and German translations of
this encyclical but found none in English, though the very idea of
an encyclical is that it is addressed to all nations and must be
translated into all their languages.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The wheel has turned full circle. For fourteen centuries the
Church was on the side of the masters and had nothing to say about
the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>itiful condition of the workers. Owing to the victory of
reaction over the French Revolution this lasted until the middle of
the 19th Century. Some of the Churches then began to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ose half-
measures to conciliate the workers, but the Church of Rome was the
last to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>atronize even these half measures. At the end of the last
century, however, the Vatican began to wonder whether the
emanci<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ation of the workers was not, like democracy, likely to be
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ermanent and it began to trim in such countries as it thought this
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofitable. The monstrous <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rogress of reaction and decay of
idealism in the last ten years have given it courage and it boldly
enjoins the Catholic world to run u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>irate-flag of the Fascist
state. One Catholic country after another obeys, but in America the
slick a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists conceal the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al orders and continue to drone
that the Roman Church is, and always was, the angel with a flaming
sword that kee<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s the greedy and the ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loiter out of their medieval

effective moral <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotecting "be weak from injustice is on a
level with the medieval myth of the knight-errant. I have read
large numbers of medieval chronicles and never came across the
figure of a knight-errant, a knight who even occasionally set out
from the castle to rescue the distressed and smite the cartiff.
Naturally it would be a left-handed com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>liment to their religion if
we had to say that one in a hundred of them did this, but all real
authorities on the Middle Ages seem to have found, like myself,
that the figure is a sheer myth largely founded on the silly
S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anish fiction, which <ent type = 'person'>Cervantes</ent> caricatures in <ent type = 'person'>Don Quixote</ent>. As
Prof. <ent type = 'person'>Medley</ent> says in Traills' Social England, if a knight met a
maid un<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotected on the road he ra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed her; and I differ from the
learned <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofessor only in this that according to all the leading
authorities on woman in the Middle Ages she is not likely to have
waited to be ra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed. In fact, if I were malicious I would <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress
further the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arallel of the knight errant and the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>. According
to all the historians of the time the knight s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ent his days roaming
the land, not to give hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>, but to acquire wealth in such ways. ...
But I will not be tem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ted to any unkind things of the Church to
which I once belonged and, stodgy as the work may be, let us return
to the statement of facts.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   And just to com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lete the record we may glance at other victims
of medieval o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ression and ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loitation who, being minorities,
really needed a cham<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ion after the workers had become strong. This
should not a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ly to women seeing that they are half the adult-race,
but it does; and they had the greater claim on the assistance of
the Roman Church from the fact that they have been through all the
modern age of increasing ske<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ticism more loyal and more generous to
the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests than the men. It would seem too big a subject to engage
u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on at the tall-end of a booklet but we, may sim<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lify it. A
cha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ter in my How Freethinkers made Notable Contributions to
Civilization sketches the fight against injustice to woman, which
mean's far more than the refusal of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olitical rights, and shows
that in America the leaders -- F. D'Arusmont, L. Mott, the <ent type = 'person'>Grimkes</ent>,
A. Kelly, L. Coleman, M.J. Gage, L.M. Child. E. Rose, H. Gardener,
C.C. Stanton, and S.B. Anthony were for the most <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art Deists (in
the early stage) or Atheists, and that in any case there was not a
Catholic amongst them. Priests jeered at their crusade. It was the
same in England and Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e generally. I enlisted in the fight,
lecturing and writing for the women, about 1900, and in the whole
20 years never heard of a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest or even a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rominent Catholic woman
who hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed. Once, near the end I was invited to address in London
the Irish (<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resumably Catholic) Women's Suffrage Society. I got no
audience and was told that anyway it would not have meant more than
half a dozen Catholic girls. I trust I am not misinformed but I was

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Let us try the Jews. I read lately that there is a sort of
circus-grou<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> going about America consisting of a Catholic <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest, 
a Protestant minister, and a Jewish rabbi telling from a common
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>latform how Christian's and Jews love each other. Adversity has
made stranger bedfellows than this holy trinity. It is just a sign
of a wintry age, for Churches. Jews, like the workers, have had to
fight themselves for emanci<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ation from the Christian tyranny and
ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loitation which lasted from the Dark Age to our own time, and
which the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s allies are restoring. There is a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersistent
statement in Catholic literature that the knights-errant of the
Vatican always <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotected the Jews. From whom? Certainly not from
the Moslem, who were most friendly with them, and not, until this
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erversity of human nature which we call Nazism began from the
modern ske<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tical states in which some Jews have grown rich and
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>owerful. I looked u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> the learned Catholic Encyclo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>edia and In

Look u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> what the Jews have to say about those five "cham<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ions" of
their race in <ent type = 'person'>Graetz</ent>'s standard 'History of the Jews.' He shows
that four of the five made great financial <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofit out of the Jews
and the fifth was harsh and cruel to them but <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotested against the
infamous <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ular massacres of them.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

treated in Christian countries as the murderers of Christ, while in

to the culture and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ros<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erity of the great civilization. From 1100

consider that in the next book -- instructed, a Christian <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rincess
that they were the "slaves" of Christians and it was not unjust to
seize their wealth. The Reformation brought some im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovement, but
it was the growing ske<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ticism of countries like England, Holland,
and France that ins<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ired a more humane attitude. In short the
Church of Rome had idly contem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lated a monstrous cruel racial
injustice for 1400 years and has never given a clear moral lead to
its followers, as is am<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ly <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roved by the birth of modern Anti-
Semitism in Catholic Austria and the recurrence of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ogroms in other
Catholic countries. It has been said in reference, to the colla<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>se
of civilization in the Dark Age: "The <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>s</ent> finished what the Huns
had begun." We may say of the sufferings of the Jews in the last
ten years: The Huns finished what the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>s</ent> began.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Finally, there is the question of the colored folk in America.
We have here a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roblem the solution of which requires a delicate
balance of social sagacity and moral sentiment. When, during the
fifty years that the Roman Church in America has claimed to be a
moral <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower that could contribute materially, in fact uniquely, to
the national guidance have its leaders made a clear and categorical
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ronouncement on the Negro question, on which whole libraries were
written? Dubois and, other s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>okesmen of the colored Americans have
declared that Catholics are amongst the most stubborn of their
o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>onents. We may surely at least say that Catholics as a body, </<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE CHURCH THE ENEMY OF THE WORKERS</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>clerical and lay, have shown and show no su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erior moral and
humanitarian feeling to others. They have insisted on the removal
of the colored folk from contact with them, often even in church,
just like others.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roblem of the colored <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulation in the United States is
notoriously the sequel to one of the most monstrous racial crimes
of modern times. In that crime England came to take as active a
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art as Catholic countries, but it is just to take into account the
fact that it was drawn in by the vast <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofit which S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain and
Portugal, the originators of the traffic in African flesh and
blood, derived from it. This brought the question of black slavery
well within the s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>here of Rome's moral jurisdiction and ke<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t it
there even after Britain and America had emanci<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ated the slaves.
Where will you find the luminous wisdom, the austere and
uncom<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>romising idealism, of the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>acy on that subject? It emerges
clearly from all the controversy on the subject that the crime had
two ecclesiastical roots a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art from the greed of S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anish and
Portuguese traders. The clergy decided that since the conversion of
the Amer-indian's was checked by the im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition of forced labor it
was ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>edient (for the good of the Church) to em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loy Africans, and
that the cruelty and misery which this involved for the Africans
was com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ensated by the fact that it brought them into the Church
outside of which -- as the Church then taught -- there was no
salvation.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   A <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint which is never made in the endless controversy on this
subject -- at least I have never found it mentioned exce<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t by the
Rev. Dr. <ent type = 'person'>Agate</ent> in the Encyclo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>edia of Religion and Ethics -- is
that slavery was the more easily im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osed u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on the Africans because
the Church had never condemned it. Most writers on the subject
imagine a long interval between what they call ancient slavery and,
the beginning of the African slave-trade; some, in fact many,
su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ose that, through the efforts of the Church of Rome, slavery
had died with the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>agan Romans. There was, on the contrary, as Dr.
<ent type = 'person'>Agate</ent> shows, a continuous traffic in slaves. It was one of the
chief industries, in the west of England (in Irish slaves) in the
10th Century, and it flourished in north Italy until the middle of
the 15th Century, when the Turks destroyed the commerce of the
Venetians and the Genoese. The heirs of these, the S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anish and
Portuguese, merely transferred the traffic to the Atlantic. No
Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al or theological <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ronouncement forbade them. <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Thomas Aquinas</ent>
had, like <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Augustine</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut the seal of Catholic scholarshi<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on it.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   As to the abolition of the traffic we never find the Roman
Church mentioned amongst the claimants of merit. It was not even a
moral <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roblem in Catholic lands until the French revolutionaries,
whom the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> anathematized, condemned it in their colonies. The
moral guide of the universe failed to see what a Protestant
a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologist has called "the blackest crime of modern times." It was
only in the light of a ske<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tical age that the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>s</ent> realized that
the brotherhood of man im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lied that all men, white, black, and
yellow, Are brothers and had a right to freedom and a decent life.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   We might extend this inquiry over other fields. When did Rome
condemn that cruel and stultifying em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loyment of children which
continued through Catholic ages and survives in full horror in 
Catholic countries? Why is there not a word of rebuke of it in the </<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

have made one <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint clear. The Vatican has never hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed the workers
because its natural alliance is with the ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loiters of the workers.

and if the line of Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy has shown some strange deviations
and meanderings in the last 50 years the cause is quite clearly
seen in the develo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ment of contem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orary life. For the moment it is
back on the straight line. The cor<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orative state makes and works a
