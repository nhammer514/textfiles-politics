<p>The Round Table Financial Takeover of Australia and New Zealand</p>

<p>- A 20 Year History In Brief</p>

<p>"Fear them not, therefore; for there is nothing covered that shall not be
revealed; and hidden, that shall shall not be known.  "What I tell you in
darkness, that espeak in light; and what ye hear in the ear, that proclaim
upon the housetops."  Matthew</p>

<p>18th May, 1967: Texas oil billionaire <ent type = 'person'>Nelson Bunker <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent></ent>, using a
sophisticated satellite technique to detect global deposits, discovers a
huge oil source south of New Zealand in the Great South Basin.</p>

<p>10th June, 1967: <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent> and New Zealand Finance Minister reach an agreement:
<ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent> will receive sole drilling rights and <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> will receive a
$US100,000 non-repayable loan from the Placid Oil Co (<ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent>'s).</p>

<p>8th September, 1967:  Placid Oil granted drilling rights to the Great South
Basin.</p>

<p>10th May, 1968: Hawaiian meeting between Onassis and top lieutenants,
<ent type = 'person'>William <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent></ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Gerald <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent></ent>, to discuss establishment of a new front
company in Australia - Australasian and Pacific Holdings Limited - to be
managed by <ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent>.  Using Onassis-Rockefeller banks, Chase Manhattan
and Shroders, Travelodge Management Ltd sets up another front to link the
operations to the US.</p>

<p>Onassis crowned head of the Mafia; <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent> (head of CIA covert operations in
S.E. Asia) ran the Onassis heroin operations in the Golden Triangle (Laos,
Burma, Thailand) with 200 Green Beret Mercenaries - ie the Phoenix
Program.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Gerald <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent></ent> deputy to ex-CIA/FBI <ent type = 'person'>Robert Maheu</ent> in the Howard Hughes
organization, took orders from Onassis and was made responsible for
laundering skim money from the Onassis casino operations in Las Vegas and
the Bahamas.</p>

<p>Mid-July, 1968: Placid Oil Co and the Seven Sisters (major oil companies)
begin Great South Basin oil exploration - <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent> Finances 45.5% of
exploration costs, Gulf Oil 14.5%, Shell (US) 10%, B.P. Oil 10%, Standard
Oil California 10%, Mobil 6.5% and Arco 6.5%.</p>

<p>12th October, 1968: <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent> and Seven Sisters announce confirmation of new oil
source comparable to the Alaskan North Slope - gas reserves estimated at
150 times larger than the Kapuni Field.</p>

<p>Early 1969: Mafia consolidates its banking operations; <ent type = 'person'>David Rockefeller</ent>
becomes Chairman of Chase Manhattan; Wriston at Citibank and Michele
Sindona captures the Vatican Bank, Partnership Pacific launched by Bank of
America, Bank of Tokyo and Bank of New South Wales.</p>

<p>24th February, 1969: Onassis calls Council meeting in Washington to discuss
strategy to monopolise the Great South Basin discovery.  Council members
included <ent type = 'person'>Nelson Rockefeller</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>John <ent type = 'person'>McCloy</ent></ent>, who managed the Seven Sisters,
and <ent type = 'person'>David Rockefeller</ent> managed the Mafia's banking operations.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>McCloy</ent> outlines the plan to capture all oil and mineral resources in
Australia and N.Z.</p>

<p>10th March, 1969: <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent> use Australasian and Pacific Holdings to
set up a 'front' company in Australia.  Using old banks - Mellon Bank and
Pittsburgh National Bank, they buy control of near-bankrupt Industrial
Equity Ltd (I.E.L.) managed by New Zealander <ent type = 'person'>Ron <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent></ent>.</p>

<p>A'Asian and Pacific Holdings' 'consultant' <ent type = 'person'>Bob <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent></ent> helps <ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent>
set up the new organization.  <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent> took orders from Mellon and Pittsburgh
National Banks, while Hand was directly responsible to <ent type = 'person'>Gerald <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent></ent> and
<ent type = 'person'>William <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent></ent>.  <ent type = 'person'>Ron <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent></ent> would take orders from Hand.</p>

<p>24th July, 1969: New board established for I.E.L. includes Hand, <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent>,
<ent type = 'person'>Ron <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent></ent>, plus two <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent> associates - <ent type = 'person'>Frank <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent></ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Bob <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent></ent>.
Both are appointed consultants to A'asian and Pacific Holdings Ltd.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent> will help <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent> launder funds into real estate (<ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent>/<ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent>
Investments) while <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> will channel funds into oil and mineral
resources through I.E.L.</p>

<p>October 1969: Chase Manhattan begins new operation in Australia with
National Bank Australasia and A.C. Goods Associates - Chase-NBA.</p>

<p>J.C. Fletcher appointed chairman of Seven Sisters' company - British
Petroleum (N.Z.).</p>

<p>17th February 1970: <ent type = 'person'>Gerald <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent></ent> sets up a new heroin-dollar laundry in
Australia - Australian International Finance Corp. using the Irving Trust
Co New York.</p>

<p>April 1970: Onassis, Rockefeller and the Seven Sisters begin setting up the
shadow World Government using the Illuminati-controlled banks and the
transnational corporations.  In Melbourne they set up the Australian
International Finance Corporation using:</p>

<p>* Irving Trust Co. N.Y. - linked to Shell Oil, Continental Oil, Phillips
Petroleum.</p>

<p>* Crocker Citizens National - linked to Atlantic Richfield (Arco), Standard
Oil of California which is Rockefeller-controlled.</p>

<p>* Bank of Montreal - Petro Canada, Penarctic Oils, Alberta Gas, Gulf Oil.</p>

<p>* Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ).</p>

<p>Meantime, Japanese members of One World Government move into New Zealand,
helped by Finance Minister R. <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent>; Mitsubishi and Mitsui make a
profitable deal buying up rights to ironsands helped by Marcona Corp. (US)
and <ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> (Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent>).  <ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> rewarded with sole New Zealand franchise
for Mitsubishi vehicles, <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> helps Mitsui (Oji Paper Co) obtain a
lucrative 320 million cubic foot Kiangaroa Forestry contract with Carter
Holt.</p>

<p>November, 1970: <ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent> extend the Rockefeller Travelodge operation by
buying control of New Zealand's largest travel company - Atlantic and
Pacific Travel.</p>

<p>Manufacturers' and Retailers' Acceptance Company (in 1970 changed to
<ent type = 'person'>Marac</ent>): This firm specialises in leasing and factoring (buying debts at a
discount).  It also finances imports and exports.  The major shareholders
are the Fletcher Group (38.0%), the Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd
(24.7%), NIMU Insurance (7.7%), Phillips 7Electrical (3.8%), National
Mutual Life Association (2.4%), New Zealand United Corporation (4.0%).
The CBA is a partner in the supranational Euro-Pacific Corporation, the
other partners being the Midland Bank (UK), the United California Bank
(USA), Fuji (Japan) and Societe Generale de Banque (France).</p>

<p>Early 1971: Onassis and Rockefeller begin global operation to buy influence
for the One World Government concept.  They use Lockheed, Northrop and
Litton Industries 'agent' <ent type = 'person'>Adnan <ent type = 'person'>Khashoggi</ent></ent>, to organize operations in the
Middle East, Iran and Indonesia.  I.C.I. set up $2.5 million slush fund to
Australia and N.Z.</p>

<p>Finance Minister <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> changes law to allow Mafia-controlled banks to
begin operations in New Zealand.  Links also made by N.Z.I. in preparation
for Paxus control with Hong Kong and Shanghai; Wells Fargo with Broadbank;
Chase Manhattan with General Finance; Bank of America and Barclays with
<ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent> and Renouf in New Zealand United Corp.  All members of the
Business Round Table Organization.</p>

<p>Late 1971: Gulf Oil and their man <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent> begin organizing chains of Shell
companies and dummy corporations to conceal their takeover operations of
oil, gas and mineral resources and related industries such as vehicle
franchises, vehicle spare parts and finance services - all part of the
Seven Sisters' controlled car culture.</p>

<p>To extend links to the US banking operations they buy control of I.S.A.S.
(NSW) and I.S.A.S. (Qld), which hold sole franchise for construction and
mining equipment produced by International Harvester Credit Co, which is
part of Chase Manhattan Bank and associated with First National Bank
Chicago (Chairman <ent type = 'person'>Sullivan</ent> also Executive Vice-President of Chase
Manhattan), Continental Illinois (linked with CIA and Mafia <ent type = 'person'>Michele Sindona</ent>
of Vatican Bank) and Rockefeller's Standard Oil of Indiana (AMOCO).</p>

<p>I.S.A.S. (Qld) also has strategic holdings in North Flinders Mines,
Flinders Petroleum, Apollo International Minerals.</p>

<p>February 1972: Onassis and Rockefeller help associate <ent type = 'person'>Adnan <ent type = 'person'>Khashoggi</ent></ent> buy
the Security Pacific National Bank in California and take control of the
United California Bank through CIA-linked Lockheed Aircraft Corporation.
Both banks used by Onassis and <ent type = 'person'>Khashoggi</ent> to funnel bribes and payoffs via
the CIA's Deak Bank to captive Japanese and other crooked politicians.
Security Pacific also used to 'launder' over $2 million for <ent type = 'person'>Nixon</ent>'s
re-election campaign.  <ent type = 'person'>Khashoggi</ent> also buys 21% of Southern Pacific
Properties, which is the major stockholder in Travelodge (Aust), thereby
establishing direct links to New Zealand, and U.E.B. and <ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent> through
its equity links with Travelodge (N.Z.).</p>

<p>April 1972: Mafia banking operations expanded through New Hebrides with
establishment of Australian International Ltd to finance Pacific
development by the oil companies (Seven Sisters).  Banks involved include
Irving Trust NY, Bank of Montreal, Crocker International, Australia &amp; N.Z.
Bank and the Mitsubishi Bank, whose president, <ent type = 'person'>Nakamaru</ent>, is appointed
Chairman.</p>

<p>26th May, 1972: <ent type = 'person'>Gerald <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent></ent> installs <ent type = 'person'>Michele Sindona</ent> as 'owner' of
Franklin National Bank, helped by the Gambino Mafia family and David
<ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> - Chairman of Continental Illinois Bank and <ent type = 'person'>Nixon</ent>'s Secretary of
the Treasury.</p>

<p>Pacific Basin Economic Council Conference in Wellington, NZ.
Vice-President <ent type = 'person'>Shigeo Nagano</ent> also chairman of Nippon Steel and member of
Onassis and other World Government organisations.  Chairman of NZ
sub-committee, J.  <ent type = 'person'>Mowbray</ent> is also General Manager of the National Bank.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <ent type = 'person'>Michele Sindona</ent>, acting as the go-between for the Mafia and the
CIA, was the conduit between US and European banks.  <ent type = 'person'>Michele Sindona</ent>'s
Vatican Bank and associate Calvi's Abrosiano Bank was used to finance CIA
neo-fascist Italian/Latin American operations through Licio Gelli's P2
Lodge, which helped to organise the 'death squads' of Argentina, Uruguay a
nd Chile.  This aided the P2 members such as <ent type = 'person'>Klaus Barbie</ent> ('The <ent type = 'person'>Butcher</ent> of
Lyons') and <ent type = 'person'>Jose Rega</ent> - organizer of the A.A.A. in Argentina.</p>

<p>16th August, 1972: Gulf Oil associate <ent type = 'person'>Bob <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent></ent> helps establish new
banking operation, first NZ international banks include Bank of New
Zealand, D.F.C. (Aust), N.Z.I., Morgan Guaranty Trust, <ent type = 'person'>Morgan Grenfel</ent> and
S.F. Warburg.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent> begins expansion overseas with deals signed in Indonesia, Fiji
and New Guinea.</p>

<p>December 1972: <ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> elected Prime Minister of New Zealand.</p>

<p>February, 1973: <ent type = 'person'>Gerald <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent></ent>, <ent type = 'person'>William <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent></ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Frank <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent></ent> and
<ent type = 'person'>Bob <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent></ent> move to further consolidate the Mafia banking operations.  In NZ
they acquire 20% Fletcher subsidiary <ent type = 'person'>Marac</ent>, using the Security Pacific
National Bank helped by <ent type = 'person'>Marac</ent> Corporate secretary <ent type = 'person'>Alan <ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent></ent>.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Frank <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent></ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent> use Fletcher and Renouf and their NZ United
Corporation to link with I.E.L. and <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent> Investments through
cross-shareholding agreement.</p>

<p>In Australia, the <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank begins operations with 30% of the stock
held by A'asian and Pacific Holdings (100% Chase Manhattan Bank), 25% by
CIA's Air America (known as 'Air Opium'), 25% by South Pacific Properties
and 20% held by <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> and Hand.</p>

<p>The Irving Trust Bank's New York Branch establishes US links between the
CIA and <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand, a worldwide network of 22 banks set up to:</p>

<p>a) 'launder' money from Onassis heroin operations in the Golden Triangle
and Iran;
b) as a CIA funnel to pro-US political parties in Europe and Latin America,
including <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent>'s P2;
c) a spying conduit for information from Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and
Thailand;
d) finance arms smuggled to Libya, Indonesia, South America, Middle East
and Rhodesia using the CIA's Edward Wilson.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Kissinger</ent> use key CIA and Naval Intelligence officers to oversee
the operation, including <ent type = 'person'>Walter Mc<ent type = 'person'>Don</ent>ald</ent> (former Deputy Director CIA), Dale
Holmgren (Flight Service Manager CIA Civil Air Transport), <ent type = 'person'>Robert Jansen</ent>
(former CIA Station Chief, Bangkok) etc.</p>

<p>Heroin flown into Australia by CIA's Air America and trans-shipped to
Onassis lieutenant in Florida, <ent type = 'person'>Santos Trafficante Jr</ent>, assisted by
Australian Federal Bureau of Narcotics officials and co-ordinated by CIA's
<ent type = 'person'><ent type = 'person'>Ray</ent> <ent type = 'person'>Cline</ent></ent>.</p>

<p>14th June, 1973: Inauguration of the Onassis shadow World Government - the
Trilateral Commission.  Includes over 200 members from the US, Europe and
Japan - bankers, government officials, transnational corporations' top
executives, trade unionists, etc. Of the world's largest corporations, 24
directly represented and dozens more through interlocking directorships.</p>

<p>* Trilateralist strategy: monopolisation of the world's resources,
production facilities, labour technology, markets, transport and finance.
These aims backed up by the US military and industrial complexes that are
already controlled and backed up by the CIA.</p>

<p>18th August, 1973: <ent type = 'person'><ent type = 'person'>Ray</ent> <ent type = 'person'>Cline</ent></ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent> meet in Adelaide to discuss
CIA plan to establish spying operations in NZ.</p>

<p>September 1973: Seagrams, with strong links to Chase Manhattan Bank of
Montreal and Toronto Dominion Bank, buys 2,800 acres of prime land in
Marlborough helped by Peter Maslen.</p>

<p>17th February, 1974: Mafia sets up New Hebrides Bank - Commercial Pacific
Trust Co (COMPAC).  Banks include CBA, Europacific Finance Corporation,
Trustee Executors and Agency Co, Fuji Bank, Toronto Dominion Bank, European
Asian Bank and United California Bank, COMPAC to be used as a cover for
heroin dollar laundering operations.</p>

<p>26th February, 1974: <ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent> meets <ent type = 'person'>Bob <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent></ent> in Wellington to
implement plans for the CIA's new spying operation - countries targeted
include France, Chile, West Germany and Israel.</p>

<p>Using the <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent>/<ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent> Investment funnel, <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent> buys building in Willeston
Street which will be rented to France and Chile, another at Plimmer Steps
to house West Germany and Israel.</p>

<p>CIA will set up eavesdropping communications centre inside the Willeston
Street building and another at 163 The Terrace which will link with
equipment installed in the Plimmer Steps building.  Four CIA technicians
will run the whole operation.</p>

<p>April 1974: Finance Minister <ent type = 'person'>Rowling</ent> appoints <ent type = 'person'>Ron Trotter</ent> to the Overseas
Investment Commission, whose chairman, G. Lau, is also a member of the <ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent>
Foundation (Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent>) investment board.</p>

<p>Whitlam and <ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent></p>

<p>Mid-1974: Gough Whitlam and Norman <ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> begin a series of moves absolutely
against the Mafia Trilateralists.  Whitlam refuses to waive restrictions on
overseas borrowings to finance Alwest Aluminium Consortium of Rupert
Murdoch, BHP and R.J. Reynolds.  Whitlam had also ended Vietnam War
support, blocked uranium mining and wanted more control over US secret spy
bases - e.g. Pine Gap.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> had introduced a new, tough Anti-Monopoly Bill and had tried to
redistribute income from big companies to the labour force through price
regulation and a wages policy.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> had also rejected plans to build a second aluminium smelter near
Dunedin and was preparing the Petroleum Amendment Bill to give more control
over New Zealand oil resources.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> had found out that <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent> Petroleum, drilling in the Great South Basin,
had discovered a huge resource of oil comparable in size to the North Sea
or Alaskan North Slope.  Gas reserves alone now estimated at 30 times
bigger than Kapuni and oil reserves of at least 20 billion barrels - enough
for New Zealand to be self-sufficient for years.  Oil companies completely
hushed up these facts.  To have announced a vast new oil source would
probably mean a decline in world oil prices, which would not have allowed
OPEC and Onassis plans for the Arabs to eventuate.  N.Z. could be exploited
at a later date, particularly since the North Sea operations were about to
come on stream - <ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> was the last to hold out.</p>

<p>September, 1974: According to CIA sources, <ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> was killed by the
Trilateralists using Sodium Morphate.  <ent type = 'person'>Rowling</ent>'s first act as NZ Prime
Minister was to withdraw <ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent>'s Anti-Monopoly Bill and the Petroleum
Amendment Bill.</p>

<p>Later, <ent type = 'person'>Rowling</ent> was to be rewarded with ambassadorship to Washington.
Incidentally, the Shah of Iran was murdered the same way as <ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> on his
arrival in the US.</p>

<p>6th October, 1974: <ent type = 'person'>Ray</ent> cline implements <ent type = 'person'>William <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent></ent> plan to oust
Australian Prime Minister Whitlam.  <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank finances payoffs to
<ent type = 'person'>Malcolm Fraser</ent> and other pro-US politicians.  A joint bugging operation
commences between CIA and ASIA.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Rupert Murdoch</ent>, playing his part, uses his newspapers and television
network to spread lies and misinformation.  Whitlam, as well as refusing to
waive restrictions on overseas borrowing to finance the aluminium
consortium, had plans to ensure that all corporations were at least 50%
Australian-owned.  This interfered with the Seven Sisters' plans to build
three oil refineries at Cape Northumberland in South Australia to exploit
the Great South Basin discovery.</p>

<p>December, 1974: Australian Governor-General <ent type = 'person'>John <ent type = 'person'>Kerr</ent></ent> joins <ent type = 'person'><ent type = 'person'>Ray</ent> <ent type = 'person'>Cline</ent></ent>'s
payroll and received his first pay-off of $US200,000 credited to his
account number 767748 at the Singapore branch of the <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank.</p>

<p>11th November, 1975: Governor-General <ent type = 'person'>Kerr</ent> sacks the Whitlam Government.</p>

<p>August 1975: <ent type = 'person'>Rowling</ent> re-introduces unrecognisable Commerce Bill, designed
to aid monopolisation of the NZ economy and repeals the News Media
Ownership Act, allowing more foreign ownership of NZ media.  The new
legislation does not define monopoly, competition or stipulate permissable
maximum market share, or even ascertain what the public interest is -
resulting in a sell-out to big business.</p>

<p>December, 1975: Election battle between <ent type = 'person'>Rowling</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent>.  Oil companies
pour thousands of dollars into <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent>'s campaign via National Bank (NZ),
whose general manager <ent type = 'person'>Mowbray</ent> is also a member of <ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> Foundations;
Investment Board Director Tudhope also Managing Director Shell Oil and
Chairman Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent>.  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> wins.</p>

<p>February, 1976: <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> implements pre-election secret agreement with the
NZ Seven Sisters' oil representatives of Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> for helping finance
the National Party campaign.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> removes the $3 per barrel oil levy for the New Zealand Refining
Company, which increases the oil companies' profits by 100% at the
taxpayers' expense and with all future oil prospecting licenses, the
Government has the option to take 51% of any discovery without meeting
exploration costs.  This is designed to discourage further exploration,
thereby keeping the lid on the Great South Basin discovery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Australia, new P.M. <ent type = 'person'>Malcolm Fraser</ent> reopens uranium mining and
opens the way for takeover of mineral resources with big tax breaks for oil
exploration, coal and mining.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> returns a favour to the oil companies by arranging $US200 million
loan for Maui Gas Development for Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent>.</p>

<p>September, 1976: With captive politicians in place in both Australia and
New Zealand, the Internationalists can now proceed with their strategy of
takeover of the economy and exploitation of natural resources.  "In New
Zealand, the elimination of unnecessary competition is fundamental to a
sound economy," <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent> says.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Parksy</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent> use <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent>/<ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent> Investments as a vehicle to buy into
A.B. Consolidated Holdings in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Associate of R. <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent>, Pat Goodman, is appointed 'consultant' of A'asian
and Pacific Holdings.</p>

<p>November, 1976: The Internationalists (Mafia) set up a NZ money 'funnel'
using Brierley's City Realties. National Insurance Co acquires 33% of the
stock.  Largest stockholders in National Insurance are the US Firemen's
Fund - Chairman and President <ent type = 'person'>Myron <ent type = 'person'>Du Bain</ent></ent> also Vice Chairman of American
Express (Amex).  Chairman of I.E.L. linked International Harvester, Archie
McCardell, also Amex Director.  Amex linked with Chase Manhattan and Seven
Sisters' Texaco and Mobil.  <ent type = 'person'>Du Bain</ent> also Director of CIA-linked United
California Bank, which is a partner in Commercial Pacific Trust.</p>

<p>To complete the money funnel, National Insurance becomes a stockholder in
Chase Manhattan's Chase-NBA.  Brierley's declared assets reach $100
million, with shareholder's capital of only $2.5 million - all cash
acquisitions.</p>

<p>3rd February, 1977: <ent type = 'person'>Parksy</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent> close down the Brierley/<ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent>
Investment funnel and open up seperate channels for Brierley and <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent>.
<ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent> will be supplied with 'laundered' funds via Sydney branch of the
<ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank, while for Ron Brierley, <ent type = 'person'>Gerald <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent></ent> uses <ent type = 'person'>Myron <ent type = 'person'>Du Bain</ent></ent>,
Director of United California Bank and also chairman and president of the
US Firemen's Fund, which are the largest stockholders in National Insurance
(NZ).  Funds to be 'laundered' via Chase Manhattan Bank through National
Insurance to City Realty and via United California Bank through COMPAC
(New Hebrides) to National Insurance and City Realties.</p>

<p>To expand the Bierley/I.E.L. 'front', <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent> establishes Industrial Equity
Pacific (Hong Kong).</p>

<p>September 1977: Brierley's new holding company begins operations -
A.B. Consolidated.  H.W. Revell appointed Deputy Chairman and B. Hancox
General Manager, while newly-appointed directors include S. Cushing,
B. Judge, O. <ent type = 'person'>Gunn</ent> and P. Goodman, linked with Renouf, Fletcher and Papps
through I.E.L./N.Z.U.C.</p>

<p>* Strategy: To target and divide key sectors of the economy for takeover,
exploitation and monopolization.  Operations to extend to use Hong Kong
facility, I.E.P. <ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent> to extend the <ent type = 'person'>Khashoggi</ent>/Rockefeller Travelodge
operation by taking holdings in Vacation Hotels and Intercontinental
Properties (Renouf Chairman).</p>

<p>October, 1977: <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> and JOhn <ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> - Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> - sign an agreement.
NZ Govt would take 24.5% holding in the Great South Basin for $1.65
Billion.  <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent> would reduce his holding from 45.5% to 27.5% and Arco would
sell its 6.5%.</p>

<p>* Reason: <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent> did not possess the technology to pump oil from deep water;
Gulf possessed the technology but did not tell <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent>.  Arco was not told
anything and were swindled out of its 6.5% concession.</p>

<p>November, 1977:  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> introduces the S.I.S Amendment Bill, designed to
keep the economy free of obstruction and to help uncover obstructive
elements.  Telephone taps, mail tampering and other surveillance methods
approved after CIA input on contents of legislation.</p>

<p>Late 1977:  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> travels to the US to meet top Rockefeller officials,
including Trilateralists' Deputy Secretary of State, <ent type = 'person'>Warren Christopher</ent>,
and <ent type = 'person'>Richard Bolbrooke</ent>, who were in charge of the new "South Pacific Desk"
at the State Department established by Rockefeller to target exploitation
of both New Zealand and Australia.  In Los Angeles, <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> meets top
Rockefeller officials, Robert Anderson (Rockwell Chairman, also Director of
Kashoggi's Security Pacific National Bank) and P. Larkin (Rockwell
Director, also Chairman, Executive Committee Security Pacific National Bank
and Director of <ent type = 'person'>Marac</ent>).</p>

<p>April, 1978:  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> sets up Petrocorp.  New Zealand taxpayers pay for the
exploration costs but the oil companies control all distribution outlets.
<ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> blocks development of Maui B as restructured supplies mean higher
prices and bigger profits for Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent>.  South Island gas market not
developed as Great South Basin fields closer than Kapuni.  Plans develop
for re-opening of National Parks for mineral exploitation.</p>

<p>22nd July, 1978: Director of Australian Federal Bureau of Narcotics
suspends his investigation into the <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank after pressure from the
CIA and Australian politicians controlled by Mafia, particularly Malcolm
Fraser.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent>'s declared assets reach $200 million, with shareholders' funds only
$17 million.</p>

<p>May, 1979: Trilateral Commission secretary <ent type = 'person'>Zbignieu <ent type = 'person'>Brzezinski</ent></ent> appoints
<ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> chairman of Board of Governors of IMF/World Bank on orders of
<ent type = 'person'>David Rockefeller</ent>.  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> would head three-man administration committee
which included Canadian Finance Minister <ent type = 'person'>Mitchell Sharp</ent>, key figure in the
Mafia Council and the Trilateral Commission.  Australian <ent type = 'person'>Treasurer McMahon</ent>
also involved.</p>

<p>8th June, 1979: <ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Frank <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent></ent>, Brierley and <ent type = 'person'>James Fetcher</ent> meet
in Hand's Sydney penthouse to discuss the establishment of the New Zealand
Mafia organization.</p>

<p>Mid- 1979: Gulf Oil using its man Brierley, begins operations designed to
capture key sectors of the economy.  A.B Consolidated restructured into the
Goodman Group and Goodman to run operations but with the majority of the
stock held by IEL and Brierley using Shell companies plus dummy
corporations.</p>

<p>* Strategy:  To take over food and produce resources, Brierley and Fletcher
restructured a small private company, H.W. Smith, using <ent type = 'person'>Cyril Smith</ent> as
Chairman but with key executives Judge, <ent type = 'person'>Collins</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>McKenzie</ent>.
<ent type = 'person'>Bob <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent></ent> helps.</p>

<p>Private company used, as no Commerce Commission control, accounts not
published, no public disclosure of transactions.  Bunting is established as
a shell company and the South Island is targeted for asset-stripping and
takeover, as well as key sectors of the automobile industry.</p>

<p>Unlimited funds channelled through City Realties, NZUC and <ent type = 'person'>Marac</ent>.
UEB extends Travelodge operations by buying control of Transholdings, which
has strategic holdings in Vacation Hotels and Tourist Corp. Fiji Holdings.</p>

<p>17th August, 1979:  New Zealand Mafia inaugral meeting in Sydney including
Hand, Brierley, Fletcher, Goodman, R.Trotter, <ent type = 'person'>Alan <ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent></ent> and L.Papps.</p>

<p>Key sectors of the economy would be taken over - food, using Goodman;
forestry and farming, using Fletcher and Trotter; property, using Brierley
and <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent>.  Brierley, Hand and Papps would be responsible for banking,
insurance and finance, while Hand and <ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent> would be responsible for
setting up new "laundry" channels into New Zealand.</p>

<p>The economy would be taken over using cheap loans of less than 5%, while
consumers would pay 28%.</p>

<p>October, 1979:  BP Oil begis $100 million joint venture deal with Fletcher
and Trotter at Tasman.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> makes secret deal with oil companies which effectively robs New
Zealand taxpayers by giving Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> the Maui Gas deal.  Normally the
granting of drilling rights on public land is done using a worldwide system
which incorporates an auction tender system.  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> bypassed this.
Also, Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> pays no tax on Kapuni profits, while putting funds into
Maui development.</p>

<p>19th November, 1979:  Secret meeting in Auckland between <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent>, Fletcher
and Trotter to transfer 43% Tasman Pulp and Paper held by New Zealand
Government to Challenge Corporation (Chairman Trotter) and <ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent>.
Tasman has lucrative 75-year contract for cheap timber signed in 1955.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> paid off with a $1 million 'non-repayable' loan - $500,000 to be
paid into account number 8746665 at New Hebrides branch of the Australian
International Bank.</p>

<p>November, 1979:  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> drops restrictions on foreign investment.
AMAX (Stnadard Oil of California subsidiary) captures the <ent type = 'person'>Martha Hill</ent>
goldmine.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> unveils the Government's plans (instructed by Rockefeller) to form
New Zealand into an offshore production base for the multi-national
corporations as benefits include government export incentives, stable
government, cheap labour, and so on.</p>

<p>27th November, 1979:  <ent type = 'person'>Gerald <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent></ent>'s lieutenant, <ent type = 'person'>David <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent></ent>, meets
<ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> to deliver $US100,000 cash to <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> for implementing the
Internationalists' Mafia Think Big plans.</p>

<p>These plans began with big contracts and guaranteed profits for the Seven
Sisters, Bechtel, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Nippon Steel, Internationalists'
Mafia banks.</p>

<p>With the experimental petroleum plant, the oil price has to be $50/barrel
to be profitable, yet Mobil's profits are guaranteed.</p>

<p>New Zealand Steel is to be expanded 500%, even though there was a global
steel glut of 50%.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent> own 10% of New Zealand Steel and are majority stockholders in
Pacific Steel and control monopoly over wire rod, reinforcing steel.  Also,
New Zealand taxpayers subsidize <ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent>' profits.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> introduces the National Development Bill with 'fast-track'
legislation, to keep the economy 'free of obstruction' for long-term
monopolization.</p>

<p>C.E.R. plan introduced, designed to integrate the economies of Australia
and New Zealand with the Trilateral Commission for the purpose of
exploiting the South Pacific countries and as a 'back-door' entrance into
China - the world's largest untapped consumer market.  New Zealand is also
the closest country to Antarctica, which has a vast mineral resource for
future exploitation.</p>

<p>"Think Big" projects begin, even though <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> aware of studies that show
New Zealand could conserve up to 40% of energy consumption using existing
technology, which would mean funds could be invested elsewhere to lower
consumer prices, lower inflation rates, less demand for imported oil and
increased employment by creating new industry to manufacture and install
energy-saving technology.  None of these options seriously considered as
all would lessen profits for members of the Rockefeller organizations.</p>

<p>December 1979:  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> unveils 'stage two' of a four-stage plan to exploit
the Great South Basin discovery.  Plan prepared by Trilateralist 'Think
Tank' - the Brookings Institute.</p>

<p>'Stage Two' includes methanol plant and synthetic petrol plant, which would
initially use gas from the Maui field and later would link with underwater
gas pipe from Campbell Island.</p>

<p>With the New Zealand Steel 500% expansion, 'stage three' of the project and
Think Big contracts to go to Bechtel, Fluor Corp., Mitsubishi, Mitsui,
Nippon Steel, etc.  All investments would be financed by the New Zealand
taxpayer.</p>

<p>17th January, 1980:  $500,000 deposited in <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent>'s account number 8746665
at the Australian International Bank, being the final payment for the
Tasman deal.</p>

agreement between Dominion Breweries and Western International Hotels
(Seattle First National Bank).</p>

<p>May, 1980:  Mafia's <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand banking operation crashes after <ent type = 'person'>Frank <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent></ent>
killed.  <ent type = 'person'>Death</ent> ruled as suicide even though no fingerprints found on the
rifle.  Maloney, Houghton, Yates and Hand shred important documents, but
miss some.  CIA helps Hand and Bank President <ent type = 'person'><ent type = 'person'>Don</ent>ald Beasley</ent> escape to the
U.S.  The CIA and Australian Security Intelligence Organisation cover
everything up.  <ent type = 'person'>Beazley</ent> appointed President of Miami City National Bank,
run by <ent type = 'person'>Alberto Dugue</ent> for 'laundering' profits from the CIA Colombian
cocaine operation.</p>

<p>There is a probability that <ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent> killed <ent type = 'person'>Frank <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent></ent> because of his
involvement with Hand's fiancee.</p>

<p>25th May, 1980:  <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent> arrived in Australia to discuss replacement of the
<ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank with Hand, Brierley, and <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent>.  Immediate funding
available from Sydney branch of the Deak Bank, a separate CIA operation,
and IEL would be used to buy NZI Corp., to prepare for future laundering
operations.</p>

<p>Maloney, Houghton, Yates, and Hand would shred all documents leading back
to the New Zealand Great South Basin connection, and the CIA would help
Hand and Bank President <ent type = 'person'>Don</ent>ald <ent type = 'person'>Beazley</ent> escape to the USA.  The CIA and ASIO
would also cover everything up.</p>

<p>Hand and <ent type = 'person'>Beazley</ent> turn up in Miami - <ent type = 'person'>Beazley</ent> appointed President and Hand
'consultant' to the Miami City National Bank, but also Hand turned up in El
Salvador to help organize bankrolling of the Contras with other ex-members
of <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent>-Hand.</p>

<p>23rd June, 1980:  New Zealand Mafia, including Brierley, Fletcher, Trotter,
<ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent>, Goodman, and Papps meet in Wellington to discuss merger of
Fletcher Challenge and Tasman.</p>

<p>In order to replace <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank's 22 world-wide branches, quick moves
are made to buy control of NZI by New Zealand Mafia using Brierley, thereby
capturing an established, world-wide organization through the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Bank, which is also linked to the CIA through its subsidiary,
World Finance Corporation.</p>

<p>Late 1980:  <ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent>, with strong Rockefeller links, obtains lucrative
contracts on US Bases in the Pacific and joint ventures in Saudi Arabia and
Iraq.</p>

<p>Control extended over New Zealand natural resources - Fletcher Challenge
and Tasman Pulp and Paper merged.  NZFP takes control of M.S.D. Spiers and
Moore Le Messurier (Aust).  Brierley begins joint venture with NZFP through
<ent type = 'person'>Williamson</ent> and Jeffrey.  I.E.L, through Goodman, buys 20% of Watties and
begins cross-shareholding agreement.  Goodman continues buying up control
of NZ bakeries and flour-mills.</p>

<p>February, 1981:  TNL., Brierley, AMOIL and MIM Holdings begin joint gold

<p>Parliamentarians For World Order - <ent type = 'person'>Richard Prebble</ent> elected one of twelve
councillors.</p>

<p>Fletcher and Papps (Chairman UEB) sell their hotel operations to
Singaporian interest closely associated with the <ent type = 'person'>Pritzker</ent> family - owners
of the Hyatt Hotel chain.  Bueton Kanter, <ent type = 'person'>Pritzker</ent> family lawyer and
Director of Hyatt Hotels, who helped arrange the deal, was an old family
partner of <ent type = 'person'>Paul Helliwell</ent> (CIA paymaster for the Bay of Pigs' fiasco) and
had helped the <ent type = 'person'>Pritzker</ent> family set up tax shelters using the CIA's
Mercantile Bank and Trust and the Castle Bank, which had been set up by
Helliwell for 'laundering' profits from the Onassis heroin operations as
well as 'skim money' from the Hughes casino operations in Las Vegas.</p>

through International Harvester, Continental Illinois Bank and the First
National Bank of Chicago.  Toyota and Nissan also help so that Brierley now
largest distributor of auto and industrial parts, largest manufacturer of
pistons, filters and engine bearings, as well as biggest supplier of
forklifts, tractors and agricultural equipment.</p>

<p>Meantime, control is extended over the Great South Basin oil source with
<ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent>, after big losses resulting from trying to corner the world's silver
market, being forced to sell out some of his concession to Gulf Oil, which

<p>Holme's A'Court's company would be taken over using Security Pacific
National Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank, with some of the stock being held

registered in Hong Kong to cover up true ownership, and will use the same
laundry as Chase Corporation - <ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent> will set up a maze of shell

<p>February 1984:  New Zealand politician D. <ent type = 'person'>Lang</ent>e meets <ent type = 'person'><ent type = 'person'>Ray</ent> <ent type = 'person'>Cline</ent></ent> in
Wellington and agrees to go on the Mafia payroll for monthly fee of
$UA40,000 paid into account number 5263161 at Commercial Pacific Trust,
New Hebrides.</p>

<p>March 1984:  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> knighted with GCMG for keeping the economy free of
obstructions for easier takeover and exploitation.</p>

<p>24th May, 1984:  Four-man CIA team co-ordinated by <ent type = 'person'><ent type = 'person'>Ray</ent> <ent type = 'person'>Cline</ent></ent> arrive in New
Zealand to begin installation of equipment for subliminal television
advertising at five sites - Waiatarua, Mt Erin, Kaukau, Sugarloaf and
Obelisk.</p>

<p>Sophisticated equipment can be installed within one kilometer of TV relay
aerials and all linked to one IDAPS computer bureau in Auckland.</p>

<p>Same equipment installed in Australia August 1985; Japan September 1986;
UK February 1987: New York 1987.  Also, Amax geoligists now estimate Martha
Hill gold source could be worth up to $30 billion on strength of high
gold/ton ore assay.</p>

<p>17th July, 1984:  In New Zealand, subliminal advertising begins on Channel
Two between 6pm and midnight - hours later extended to begin at noon.
Subliminal messages prepared in the US by the CIA and with New Zealand
election imminent, tell voters to support the Labour Party, the New Zealand
Party and to buy Mafia company products.</p>

<p>New Zealand Party was formed to ensure that <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> would lose, as Big
Business unhappy with controls over economy.  Big campaign contributions
from Brierley, the oil companies and the Business Round Table ensure a
Labour victory.</p>

<p>Later, <ent type = 'person'>Lang</ent>e agrees to repay the favour to Brierley by selling the
Government holding in the Kariori Pulp Mill to Winstones.  New Zealand
taxpayer loses $100 million.</p>

<p>Government then becomes the arm of big business, using economic policies
provided by the Business Round Table, implemented by Finance Minister Roger
<ent type = 'person'>Douglas</ent> and the package being sold by David <ent type = 'person'>Lang</ent>e, who also keeps up a
noisy CIA directed ANZUS withdrawal campaign.</p>

<p> * Reason:  1) ANZUS Treaty did not cover Mafia requirements over the Great
South Basin discovery;
    2) To identify any oppositin or threats within New Zealand who
align themselves with supposed Government policy, <ent type = 'person'>Lang</ent>e increases the SIS
budget and strangthens links with the CIA.</p>

<p>Brookings Institute are the actual designers of the New Zealand Government
econmomic policies provided by the Business Round Table (NZ Mafia front)
and implented by the Government.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Douglas</ent> devalues the dollar and deregulates interest rates, which means
cheaper labor, cheaper capital assets and high mortgage rates, thereby
implementing Big Business policy of driving farmers off the land,
establishment of the corporate farm and eventually remove viability of
small business sector, etc.</p>

<p>27th September, 1984: New Zealand Mafia meets at new 'safe house'
registered under <ent type = 'person'>Fernyhough</ent>'s name, in Auckland.  Those present include

Judge, Renouf, <ent type = 'person'>Fernyhough</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Gibbs</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>McConnell</ent>.  <ent type = 'person'>Daigo Miyado</ent> announces
appointment of Trotter as International Vice President of the Trilateral
Commission Pacific Basin Economic Council.</p>

<p>Brierley outlines strategy of privatization of the New Zealand Government
and the establishment of the New Zealand Centre for Independent Studies
which will be chaired by <ent type = 'person'>Gibbs</ent>, aided by <ent type = 'person'>Fernyhough</ent> and controlled by
<ent type = 'person'>Cline</ent>, which will 'advise' Treasury on privatization.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent>, Brierley and <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent> hold a separate meeting with <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent>, outlining
plans for an expanded laundry operation which will coincide with the launch
of 'Crack' - a new addictive product developed by CIA chemists for the
world market.</p>

<p>Equiticorp (Aust) will be launched with <ent type = 'person'>Adler</ent> as Manager and a new merchant
bank using Eldrs, Goodman and Jarden.</p>

<p>IEI will merge with Armco Bank, which has 20 branches in South East Asia;
<ent type = 'person'>Ariadne</ent> will acquire the Bank of Queensland, and Brierley Investments will
form a cross-shareholding with NZI Corp to further increase control by
their Mafia organization.  Other plans include the laundering of funds
directly to the New Zealand and Australian Governments and the
establishment of key companies within the economies of New Zealand,
Australia and Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The first key company will control the food industry in Australasia through
merger of Elders, Goodmans, Allied Mills, <ent type = 'person'>Fielder Gillespie</ent> and Watties.
Allied Mills will control 30% Goodmans, 30% Fielder, 20% Watties and will
expand into Europe via acquisition of Rank, Hovis McDougall (UK).  Allied
Mills will be controlled through IEL.</p>

<p>26th October, 1984:  Trotter, <ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Lang</ent>e and <ent type = 'person'>Douglas</ent> meet in Wellington
to implement Mafia plans to privatise the Government and to deregulate the
banking system.</p>

<p>Late 1984:  As part of the IDAPS computer-controlled 'laundry' operation,
Trotter and Fletcher help establish the 'Pacific Investment Fund' with
Australian and New Zealand investments to be managed by Hong Kong and
Shanghai Bank subsidiary, <ent type = 'person'>Wardley</ent> and the Japanese operation controlled by
Tokyo Trust and Banking Company - owned by Sanwa Bank, Taiyo-Kobe Bank and
Nomura Securities.  All are members of the Rockefeller World Government
organization.</p>

<p>18th July, 1985:  Australian Mafia meet in Sydney to discuss privatization
of the Australian Government.  Those present include - Brierley, Trotter,
Fletcher, <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent>, Goodman, Papps, Packer, Bond, <ent type = 'person'>Elliott</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Adler</ent>, and
Japanese Trilateralist <ent type = 'person'>Daigo Miyado</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Cline</ent> will set up Australian Centre for Independent Studies to 'advise' the
Treasurer on the takeover of the economy.</p>

<p>Impala Pacific will be set up in Hong Kong through <ent type = 'person'>Ariadne</ent> with 60% of the
company stock held by Chase Manhattan and Security Pacific National Bank in
Australia.  In the UK, Tozer, Kemsly &amp; MIllbourn would be taken over using
IEP, while in Australia, the Holme's A'Court Bell Group would be used to
merge with Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, through Standard &amp; Chartered Bank
(Hong Kong), and Marae (NZ) Broadlands (Aust) would merge with NZI
Corporation.</p>

control of the Mafia organization.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent> would organise an 8-man 'hit squad' to be headed by <ent type = 'person'>Gordon Liddy</ent> who
had worked for <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent> in the 1960's as a CIA contract killer, and was
responsible for over 10 murders including:</p>

<p>  *  8/17/61  - two members of the Gambino Mafia family in New York

strategy for merger of Goodman, Allied Mills, Fielde Gillespie Davis,
Watties and Elders with Chase Manhattan Bank taking 20%, Elders and IEL
10%, with stock being held through Chase-AMP Bank.</p>

<p>Elders woul be used as major 'vehicle' in the global liquor economy with
Courage Brewery in the UK to be used as entry into Europe.</p>

<p>Strategy finalized to take over BHP, Australia's largest company, using H
olme's A'Court, Brierley, <ent type = 'person'>Elliott</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent>.</p>

<p>In London, Chase Manhattan would takeover stockbrokers Simon &amp; Coates who
specialize in A'Asia Mafia owned companies such as Fletcher Challenge,
Brierley, NZI Corp, Elders, Bell Group and BHP.  Chase Manhattan could then
issue and buy stock to manipulate the Australasian economy by increasing
price, paying no taxes, creating inflation, and enslaving the people
through debt to Mafia controlled banks.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent> would oversee the 'launder' of further loans to the NZ Government
and would begin to channel 'loans' through the Australian Treasury using
captive politician <ent type = 'person'>Keating</ent>.  Also NZ Government building would be sold to
<ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent> and Australia Government buildings would be sold to <ent type = 'person'>Adler</ent> which would
then be rented back to the respective Governments at inflated prices.</p>

<p>17th November 1986:  Brierley, <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent>, Packer, Bond, <ent type = 'person'>Elliott</ent>, Holmes
A'Court and <ent type = 'person'>Adler</ent> meet in Sydney.  Also present is <ent type = 'person'>Rupert Murdoch</ent> to assist
in <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent> strategy of media takeover in Australasia and the Pacific using
Packer and Bond (TV and Radio) Brierley and Holmes A'Court (newspapers).</p>

<p>Murdoch takes orders from <ent type = 'person'>Brzezinski</ent> since his News Corp was taken over in
1982 by Chase Manhattan and Security Pacific National Bank.</p>

<p>At a separate meeting with Brierley, <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Cline</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent> outlines plan
for 'key' Media Australasian Holding company using the Bell Group which
would be taken over by with Chase Manhattan holding 27.5% in London and the
US.  Another 10% of the stock would be held through Security Pacific
National Bank (US).</p>

Rockefeller, <ent type = 'person'>John <ent type = 'person'>McCloy</ent></ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Brzezinski</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent>, Simon, <ent type = 'person'>Katherine Graham</ent>, and
George Franklin.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Brzezinski</ent> outlines plans to invade Iran using 75,000 strong mercenary army
supported by US Air Force and Navy with starting date of 8th February,
1988.  An integral part of the plan Saudi and Kuwaiti oil tankers would fly
the US flag to provoke an Iranian attack so that US invasion of Iran would
be 'justified'.</p>

<p> * Reason:  The Seven Sisters wanted to exploit a secret oil field near
<ent type = 'person'>Bandar Abbas</ent> discovered in 1976 with estimate 150 billion barrels and also
a huge gold source at Neyshabur discovered in 1977.</p>

<p>The Iranian invasion would begin after the World economic system was
collapsed by the Mafia controlled banks - target date 17th January 1988.
Other countries on the takeover list include:
 * Mexico - for oil at Baisas
 * Nicaragua - for oil at Connto
 * Colombia -  for gold at Papayan
 * South Korea - for gold at Chunchon
 * New Zealand - for oil in the Great South Basin.</p>

<p>(Obviously this part of the plan failed to happen)</p>

<p>Re: Novus Ordo Seclorum.</p>

<p>This phrase is from the FREEMASONS 100%!</p>

<p>I will post more details later.</p>

<p>The Freemasons are alive and well in the USA.  There are 33 degrees of
membership.  On the top level are the leaders of various countries.
On the basic level there are people like you and me (ordinary <ent type = 'person'>Joes</ent>).
I do not mean to say I am a Freemason, by the way.</p>

<p>They are NOT known as Freemasons over here; they are known as "lodges".
Thus, the Shriners, the Elks, etc. are all the same group.</p>

<p>They are existing from the time of <ent type = 'person'>Moses</ent>, or maybe even from before that.
It used to be Greek and <ent type = 'person'>Roman</ent> influenced fraternity.  They were outlawed in
Pakistan in the late  70's because of their involvement in some
questionable things.  It is said that the Freemasons want to protect and
maintain a certain status quo in the world (make it safe for the extremely r
ich), but <ent type = 'person'>God</ent> knows best as to their real aims.</p>

<p>The Lodges are very active in doing some good things for the common man.
The Shriners have adopted a pseudo-Islamic pose, without having anything
to do with Islam as presented in the Quran.  The Shriners have their own
"prophets" etc.</p>

<p>It is easy to join the Freemason fraternity on the basic level.  You are
told that it is for uniting all the different nations and religions of the
world.  You can only progress (up the 33 degrees) if you are of any use in
your social position to the Freemasons.  You may join as a basic Freemason,
and remain so all your life, and it would look like you just joined a
harmless social club.</p>

<p>On the top level, their aims are quite different.  They do not like any
organization (in the name of religion or anything else) to endanger their
financial assets and interests.  Some believe that the Freemasons have
been successful in completely destroying the faith of ordinary Christian
by influencing and introducing corruption in the Christian church, and
distorting religious concepts.  The big challenge before the Freemasons
now is to destroy the organizing power of Islam, which they view as the
final threat.</p>

<p>There has been some research done on the Freemasons, their introduction
methods, their activities (open and hidden), in Pakistan, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia.  If anyone is interested, I can detail everything in my following
posts.</p>

<p>This is nonsense; <ent type = 'person'>Jaynes</ent>'s book says no such thing. Not only does it not
mention the Illuminati or "Illuminati-like leaders," but its thesis is
that the bicamerality of the brain is the ground of true self-
consciousness. It is not the case that "non-bicameral" is the equivalent of
"enlightened"--just the opposite, really.</p>

<p>Jack,  
 
I forgot to give you the beta on the Illuminati:  
  
These folks are more secret than <ent type = 'person'>Moussad</ent>(the Israeli SS) who is the  
undisputed ultimate "secret agent men/women" experts of the world.  
Therefore, you will find no reliable sources of information on them.  
  
They like to frequent Swiss chalets and spend their loot on good spirits
and women. Oh, they do not have women for members.
  
Their associates are in international banking and are world leaders of  
organized crime. But they are not ever necessarily top world leaders or 
top CEO's, but they completely influence the major decisions of most 
multinational companies and world leaders. 
 
They are always there but you never see them: 
  
Once, at a coffee shop in an affluent Denver 'burb in the foothills, I ran 
across a man of this general authority. With a German accent, he had told  
me that if I were to sit at a table, I was to buy coffee, but he did not  
work there. He wore a $2,000 Swiss pilot's chronometer on one wrist. His  
clothes cost at least half of the watch and he wasn't wearing a suit! 
We were just waiting for the rain to stop and I could not believe my ears  
when he tried to shoo me away from my dry spot under the curbside table's  
canvas awning. I thought carefully and then replied something to the likes 
of "The Illuminati would always like for me to be recirculating my money 
back into their economic system of manipulation." 
  
As soon as I said this, never mind the weather, he took off. He was a 
strong 50 year old Aryan, about 6'1", 200lbs, to my 5'11", 150lbs  
but he looked extremely agitated before he left. I could tell he was not 
physically scared of me. In fact, he knew all too well what I was saying
about the globally economic policies of his "associates" in the Illuminati.
You see, they have effectively cut off information about even their
existence, that it will damn near give one of them vapor lock if you call
their hand!
(Notice that Europe houses the ultimate banks next to Bavaria on Swiss
soil, and note how the Swiss are given International Neutrality to boot so
that the Secret accounts will be safe and stable! I would wager a month of
Sundays that money in a Swiss account is backed by real gold too!)
 
Conclusion:  
 
<ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> belongs to the "Skull and Crossbones Club" which is the American  
Equivalent of the Illuninati. You have to study at Yale and be in a family
that is part of the old boy system and then you might get in. It is highly
secret, but really is much more well known than the Illuminati. It exists
to perpetuate the existence of the old boys in Amerika, much as the
Illuminati does the same in Europe.
  
Amazingly, the only reference to the Illuminati that I have ever seen other  
than in a few paper back books on mysticism called the Trilogy which
actually are probably right 50% of the time, was in the Unabridged
Webster's Dictionary, where all it dares say is that they were "the members
of an anticlerical, deistic, republican society founded in  1776 by Adam
Weishaupt, professor of law at Ingolstadt in Bavaria. It was suppressed by
the Bavarian government in 1785: called also the Order of the Illuminati."
  
I suppose they had to go deep undercover, much more so than even the Mafia.  
This might explain the agitation I evoked in the fellow! 
 
It might be fun to know more about these fellow, but you now know all you 
need to know, except their names. Search and destroy!

<p>HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE BLOCKS S&amp;L INVESTIGATION
=====================================================
Convergence Magazine, Christic Institute, Winter 1991, p. 16</p>

<p>As Convergence went to press we learned that the House Intelligence
Committee will refuse to investigate the reported use of failed savings and
loan institutions to launder funds for the <ent type = 'person'>Reagan</ent> Administration's secret
war in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>The last issue of Convergence (Fall 1990) reported that an investigation by
the Christic Institute had found new evidence that drug traffickers may
have taken advantage of S&amp;L deregulation to launder cocaine profits
destined for the contras. In a separate investigation, the Houston Post has
concluded that several failed S&amp;Ls were looted by businessmen connected
with both organized crime and the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>

<p>Last summer the House Banking subcommittee on financial institutions
attempted to investigate the reports, but abandoned the effort when C.I.A.
Director <ent type = 'person'>William Webster</ent> refused to testify. But the subcommittee's chair,
Illinois Democrat <ent type = 'person'>Frank Annunzio</ent>, referred the allegations to the House
Intelligence Committee, which has jurisdiction over America's spy agencies.</p>

<p>On Nov. 15 the Christic Institute delivered 30,000 petitions to
Rep. Anthony <ent type = 'person'>Beilenson</ent>, the California Democrat who chairs the Intelligence
Committee, asking for a full investigation of the reports.  The signatures
were gathered in 22 cities in one day of canvassing by volunteers from the
Christic Institute's local action networks and the Citizen/Labor Energy
Coalition.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the intelligence committee said the staff had conducted
dozens of interviews to determine whether the reports should be
investigated. But in November investigative journalist <ent type = 'person'>Pete <ent type = 'person'>Brewton</ent></ent>
reported in the Houston Post that ``the committee has not attempted to
trace any of the S&amp;L money looted by C.I.A. operatives.''</p>

<p>The committee staff also failed to contact a former C.I.A. contract agent
who told a Federal court in 1988 that the agency used funds from failed
banks and thrift institutions to finance covert operations.</p>

<p>When asked by <ent type = 'person'>Brewton</ent> why the committee made no attempt to trace any S&amp;L
money to discover if it had been used for covert operations, staff director
<ent type = 'person'>Dan <ent type = 'person'>Childs</ent></ent> said ``we have only three attorneys to do this.''</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Childs</ent> was the chief financial officer for the C.I.A. during the period
when the alleged transfer of funds occurred.</p>

<p>The Christic Institute's probe of S&amp;L fraud goes back to 1988, when
Christic investigators found evidence that C.I.A.-sponsored drug
traffickers may have used dozens of thrifts in several states to launder
cocaine profits destined for the contra war effort.</p>

<p>``The Christic Institute has uncovered evidence that covert operatives and
drug traffickers exploited dozens of S&amp;Ls to launder funds destined for
the illegal contra war,'' said Daniel P. Sheehan, the Institute's general
counsel. ``This evidence suggests that the links among S&amp;Ls, covert
operatives and organized crime can be traced to the `off-the-shelf
enterprise' described by <ent type = 'person'>Oliver North</ent> before the Iran-contra investigating
committees.</p>

<p>``It appears that S&amp;Ls may have made fraudulent loans in order to siphon
money to the contras at a time when Congress had cut off aid to the
rebels.''</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Brewton</ent>'s investigative series in Post has concluded that ``at least 27
failed financial institutions (25 S&amp;Ls and two banks) had links to C.I.A.
operatives or to organized crime figures with links to the C.I.A..''</p>

<p>``The savings and loan collapse will cost taxpayers over $500 billion,''
said <ent type = 'person'>Sara Nelson</ent>, the Institute's executive director. ``If it is true that
S&amp;L money went to the contras, then the U.S. public was duped into paying
the bill for the contra war after Congress had outlawed contra aid.
The evidence pointing to a systematic fraud on</p>

<p>``The response to this petition has been enormous,'' said Nelson, ``and
shows just how upset people are that Congress has failed to investigate
the intelligence connection to the S&amp;L collapse. We hope that Congressman
<ent type = 'person'>Beilenson</ent> will take this message very seriously.''</p>
