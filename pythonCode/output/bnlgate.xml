   BNL - IRAQGATE SCANDAL

    The Chicago Connection - <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> &amp; Saddam Inc.
    Key documents - sought by <ent type = 'person'>Gonzalez</ent> - withheld

With <ent type = 'person'>George <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent></ent> ready to take America into another war with Iraq to
destroy the nuclear, chemical, biological and missiles weapons that <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent>
himself helped <ent type = 'person'>Saddam <ent type = 'person'>Hussein</ent></ent> to build, Congressmen Henry <ent type = 'person'>Gonzalez</ent>, the
courageous Texas Democrat who heads the House Banking Committee, continues,
single-handedly, to peel back layer after layer of cover-up to reveal the
monumental proportions of the Iraqgate-BNL (Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro)
scandal that now threatens to bring down the <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> regime. But the most
explosive documents have been withheld.

   Over the past several months <ent type = 'person'>Gonzalez</ent>  has shown  the  Iraqgate-
BNL scandal to be bigger than anyone had imagined.  He has uncovered and
reported incontestable evidence that <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> and his associates secretly sold
nuclear, biological, chemical and missile-related weapons materials to
<ent type = 'person'>Saddam <ent type = 'person'>Hussein</ent></ent>; blocked investigations into the use of such materials by
<ent type = 'person'>Hussein</ent>; suppressed memos warning of the dangers of such sales;
deliberately  falsified documents on such sales submitted to Congress and
interfered illegally to halt investigations into the criminal activities of
the BNL bank in secretly diverting American agricultural loans to buy the
weapons for <ent type = 'person'>Hussein</ent>.

BNL-BCCI  Chicago Branches

 <ent type = 'person'>Gonzalez</ent> has revealed a <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> policy disaster that lead to the first
Gulf War and a blunder that is now costing the Americans  $2 billion to pay
off the loans <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> guaranteed with U.S. taxpayersU money . <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> repeatedly
ignored warnings that Iraq would default on the loans.  Now,  certain key
documents - perhaps the most revealing yet -  are  being withheld from the
<ent type = 'person'>Gonzalez</ent> investigation.  They are said to be the records of the Chicago
branches of BNL and BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International),
through which, some investigators say , <ent type = 'person'>George <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent></ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Saddam <ent type = 'person'>Hussein</ent></ent> may
have been  involved in a joint, private enterprise to skim oil profits
arising from <ent type = 'person'>Reagan</ent>-<ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> policies toward Iraq. The  documents have been
impounded by a Chicago court and Congressman  <ent type = 'person'>Gonzalez</ent> Banking Committee
has been denied access.

<ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent>'s Pennzoil Profits

 Between 1980 and 1990 the Gulf region exported a trillion dollars
worth of oil to the West. Hundreds of billions of dollars in kickbacks were
involved. Some of the kickbacks were said to be  handled by the BNL/BCCI
banks for Pennzoil, an oil company founded by <ent type = 'person'>George <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent></ent>  The Pennzoil
case  was (is?) the target of <ent type = 'person'>Ross PerotUs</ent> much-denied investigation of the
<ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> family and friends. Investigators believe the Chicago bank records
could help explain <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent>Us massive, covert military support for Iraq in the
years between 1981-1990.

   The Chicago BNL /BCCI records could also provide clues to why the
<ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> Administration secretly - and possibly illegally - exempted eleven
members of the <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> cabinet from conflict of interest restrictions in their
handling of the Gulf war policy. <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> simply declared that the law
regarding conflict of interest would cease to apply to his advisors on the
Gulf war policy. He then ordered that his declaration would be not be made
public. Congressman <ent type = 'person'>Gonzalez</ent> is now asking <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> to  explain the deal. <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent>
has not responded.

  According to some investigators,  the BNL-BCCI bank documents
now impounded by a Chicago  judge could  shed light not only on the
Iraqgate case, but on other illegal transactions including Iran-Contra,
October Surprise and the <ent type = 'person'>Inslaw</ent> case. In all instances monies passed
through the BNL/BCCI  banking network.

  BNL is an Italian bank now under  investigation by Congress for
fraud in using loans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to finance
IraqUs pre-war military buildup. Over the past thirty years, BNL is
suspected of involvement in a wide range of international criminal
activities. (French Intelligence investigators have even linked the bank to
large payments to certain individuals in Europe in late 1963, thought to be
associated with the <ent type = 'person'>John Kennedy</ent> assassination.)

   On December 28th 1990, when <ent type = 'person'>Gonzalez</ent>  sought the records of the
Chicago branch of BNL (Case number 90 C 6863 of the U.S. District Court in
Chicago: People of the State of Illinois ex re; William C. Harris v. the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), <ent type = 'person'>Gonzalez</ent> was told by
Federal Judge, <ent type = 'person'>Brian <ent type = 'person'>Duff</ent></ent> that he could not have them. <ent type = 'person'>Duff</ent>, a friend of
both <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Reagan</ent>, works closely with the Federal Reserve Bank. <ent type = 'person'>Duff</ent>
impounded the documents and abused <ent type = 'person'>Gonzalez</ent>U attorney for Rbehaving like an
800 -pound gorilla.S That is when <ent type = 'person'>Duff</ent> impounded the records.

  Questions abound. Suspicions arise from the fact that among
officials involved in the BNL bank is Brent <ent type = 'person'>Scowcroft</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent>Us National
Security advisor who, <ent type = 'person'>Gonzalez</ent> has now revealed, maintained a million-
dollar financial interest in 40 of the biggest U.S. weapons companies that
profited from U.S. policies toward Iraq, including General Electric,
General Motors, ITT, and Lockheed. <ent type = 'person'>Gonzalez</ent> has also revealed that
Assistant Secretary of State <ent type = 'person'>Laurence Eagleberger</ent> worked closely with BNL
when he and <ent type = 'person'>Scowcroft</ent> were part of <ent type = 'person'>Henry <ent type = 'person'>Kissinger</ent>Us</ent> consulting firm.
<ent type = 'person'>Kissinger</ent> was a member of the board of BNL and his firm represents BNL in
the USA.

BNL, P2 and the Vatican Bank

  The BNL bank was also used for secret arms trade by the outlawed P2
Masonic Lodge of Rome, whose Grandmaster, <ent type = 'person'>Licio <ent type = 'person'>Gelli</ent></ent> is thought to have
been the mastermind behind BNLUs illegal, world-wide banking strategies,
until his arrest in 1981, for embezzling $1.5 billion from the Vatican
Bank. The Vatican Bank had close ties with BNL. <ent type = 'person'>Gelli</ent> was recently
sentenced to 18 years in jail for his role in the case.

  <ent type = 'person'>Gelli</ent> was involved with the PopeUs banker and bodyguard, Bishop
<ent type = 'person'>Marcinkus</ent> (formerly of Chicago) in the Vatican Bank embezzlement. When  the
Italian government issued a warrant for the BishopUs arrest they were
blocked by the Vatican, which claims  separate city-state authority. (The
Pope is still closely involved with <ent type = 'person'>Marcinkus</ent> and the Vatican Bank is still
closely associated with BNL.)

  <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Gelli</ent> are friends.  <ent type = 'person'>Gelli</ent> was guest of honor at the 1981
<ent type = 'person'>Reagan</ent>-<ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> inaugural ball. (N.Y. Times, June 4, 1981, page 7.)  <ent type = 'person'>Kissinger</ent>
also knew <ent type = 'person'>Gelli</ent>. When <ent type = 'person'>Gelli</ent> was arrested in March, 1981, <ent type = 'person'>Kissinger</ent>
immediately sent an agent to Rome with $18,000 to try to buy some of the
documents in the P2 case to keep them from becoming public ( In These
Times, Sept. 1982).  It may be of interest that P2 had a lodge in Chicago.

  Chicago, it is now emerging, has been the central point for vast,
international, illegal transactions involving the BNL and BCCI banks and
secret deals with American oil companies, military manufacturers, the CIA,
and possibly U.S. politicians. (According to a London source, unreleased
BCCI documents in the possession of the Bank of London  list the names of
at least 105 members of U.S. Congress - of both Houses and both parties -
who have received money through the Chicago branch of BCCI. The U.S.
Federal Reserve is said to have a copy of the same secret BCCI list).

The Octopus

 Just as the P2 scandal in Italy brought down the government and
destroyed hundred of careers in politics, industry and banking,  so too the
BNL/BCCI - Penzzoil case could bring down the <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> administration and send
dozens of top administration officials to jail. Indeed the P2 and BNL cases
overlap in the October Surprise case,  and U.S. investigators would do well
to examine the Italian government documents in the P2 case as part of their
inquiry into the October Surprise/BNL/BCCI/Penzzoil/<ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent>/<ent type = 'person'>Hussein</ent> links. It
is beginning to look as though the late journalist, <ent type = 'person'>Danny Casselaro</ent> was on
the right track at the time of his highly suspicious RsuicideS last year,
when he was investigating what he called RThe OctopusS, a vast,
interlocking, international criminal conspiracy.

<ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent>'s Watergate

 Congress is now calling for the appointment of a Special Prosecutor
to investigate the ballooning BNL-Iraqgate case.  In his insightful and
relentless reporting on the case in The New York Times, <ent type = 'person'>William Safire</ent> says
flatly that BNL will be <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent>Us Watergate.  Saffire is now investigating the
Chicago link to the case. (Updates on the case now appear regularly on the
recorded telephone hotlines of controversial Chicago investigator, Sherman
Scholnick of the RCommittee to Clean Up the CourtsS,  who has spearheaded
his own investigation. Call: 312 - 731 1100 &amp;  312- 731 1505 for five-
minute recorded updates.)

   When appointed, the Special Prosecutor in the BNL/Iraqgate case
should have immediate access to all the records, including the crucial
documents now confiscated and impounded by the Chicago court.

  When the truth of the BNL case is finally revealed, the War &amp;
Peace foundation believes we will see the extent to which politics around
the world
have been corrupted by the arms trade. Iraqgate will serve as further
evidence of the need for international monitoring by the United Nations of
all weapons traffic as a first, essential step toward complete world
disarmament.

  Ironically, as we go to press,  joint efforts by both houses of
Congress in the wake of the Iraqgate revelations to tighten restrictions on
the sale of nuclear weapons-related materials to nations like Iraq, Iran
and Syria, have provoked a threat of veto by <ent type = 'person'>George <ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent></ent>, who argues that
such non- proliferation legislation would mean a loss of business for
American nuclear exporters!
