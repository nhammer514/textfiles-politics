<p>The Round Table Financial Takeover of Australia and New Zealand</p>

<p>- A 20 Year History In Brief</p>

<p>"Fear them not, therefore; for there is nothing covered that shall
not be revealed; and hidden, that shall shall not be known.  "What
I tell you in darkness, that espeak in light; and what ye hear in
the ear, that proclaim upon the housetops." Matthew</p>

<p>18th May, 1967: Texas oil billionaire <ent type = 'person'>Nelson Bunker <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent></ent>, using a

South Basin.</p>

<p>10th June, 1967: <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent> and New Zealand Finance Minister reach an
agreement: <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent> will receive sole drilling rights and <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> will

establishment of a new front company in Australia - Australasian
and Pacific Holdings Limited - to be managed by <ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent>.
Using Onassis-Rockefeller banks, Chase Manhattan and Shroders,
Travelodge Management Ltd sets up another front to link the
operations to the US.</p>

<p>Onassis crowned head of the Mafia; <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent> (head of CIA covert
operations in S.E. Asia) ran the Onassis heroin operations in the
Golden Triangle (Laos, Burma, Thailand) with 200 Green Beret

<p><ent type = 'person'>Gerald <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent></ent> deputy to ex-CIA/FBI <ent type = 'person'>Robert Maheu</ent> in the Howard
Hughes organisation, took orders from Onassis and was made
responsible for laundering skim money from the Onassis casino
operations in Las Vegas and the Bahamas.</p>

<p>Mid-July, 1968: Placid Oil Co and the Seven Sisters (major oil
companies) begin Great South Basin oil exploration - hunt finances
45.5% of exploration costs, Gulf Oil 14.5%, Shell (US) 10%, B.P.

<p>12th October, 1968: <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent> and Seven Sisters announce confirmation
of new oil source comparable to the Alaskan North Slope - gas
reserves estimated at 150 times larger than the Kapuni Field.</p>

<p>Early 1969: Mafia consolidates its banking operations; David
Rockefeller becomes Chairman of Chase Manhattan; Wriston at
Citibank and <ent type = 'person'>Michele Sindona</ent> captures the Vatican Bank,
Partnership Pacific launched by Bank of America, Bank of Tokyo and

Council members included <ent type = 'person'>Nelson Rockefeller</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>John <ent type = 'person'>McCloy</ent></ent>, who
managed the Seven Sisters, and <ent type = 'person'>David Rockefeller</ent> managed the
Mafia's banking operations.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>McCloy</ent> outlines the plan to capture all oil and mineral resources
in Australia and N.Z.</p>

<p>10th March, 1969: <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent> use Australasian and Pacific
Holdings to set up a 'front' company in Australia. Using old banks
-Mellon Bank and Pittsburgh National Bank, they buy control of
near-bankrupt Industrial Equity Ltd (I.E.L.) managed by New
Zealander <ent type = 'person'>Ron <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent></ent>.</p>

<p>A'Asian and Pacific Holdings' 'consultant' <ent type = 'person'>Bob <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent></ent> helps
<ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent> set up the new organisation. <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent> took orders from
Mellon and Pittsburgh National Banks, while Hand was directly
responsible to <ent type = 'person'>Gerald <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent></ent> and <ent type = 'person'>William <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent></ent>. <ent type = 'person'>Ron <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent></ent> would
take orders from Hand.</p>

<p>24th July, 1969: New board established for I.E.L. includes Hand, <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent>, Ron
<ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent>, plus two <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent> associates - <ent type = 'person'>Frank <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent></ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Bob <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent></ent>.
Both are appointed consultants to A'asian and Pacific Holdings Ltd.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent> will help <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent> launder funds into real estate
(<ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent>/<ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent> Investments) while <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> will channel
funds into oil and mineral resources through I.E.L.</p>

<p>October 1969: Chase Manhattan begins new operation in Australia
with National Bank Australasia and A.C. Goods Associates - Chase-NBA.</p>

<p>J.C. Fletcher appointed chairman of Seven Sisters' company -
British Petroleum (N.Z.).</p>

<p>17th February 1970: <ent type = 'person'>Gerald <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent></ent> sets up a new heroin-dollar
laundry in Australia - Australian International Finance Corp.
using the Irving Trust Co New York.</p>

<p>April 1970: Onassis, Rockefeller and the Seven Sisters begin
setting up the shadow World Government using the
Illuminati-controlled banks and the transnational corporations. In
Melbourne they set up the Australian International Finance
Corporation using:</p>

<p>* Irving Trust Co. N.Y. - linked to Shell Oil, Continental Oil,
Phillips Petroleum.</p>

<p>* Crocker Citizens National - linked to Atlantic Richfield (Arco),
Standard Oil of California which is Rockefeller-controlled.</p>

<p>* Bank of Montreal - Petro Canada, Penarctic Oils, Alberta Gas, Gulf Oil.</p>

<p>* Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ).</p>

<p>Meantime, Japanese members of One World Government move into New
Zealand, helped by Finance Minister R. <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent>; Mitsubishi and
Mitsui make a profitable deal buying up rights to ironsands helped by Marcon
a
Corp. (US) and <ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> (Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent>). <ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> rewarded with sole New
Zealand franchise for Mitsubishi vehicles, <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> helps Mitsui
(Oji Paper Co) obtain a lucrative 320 million cubic foot Kiangaroa
Forestry contract with Carter Holt.</p>

<p>November, 1970: <ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent> extend the Rockefeller Travelodge
operation by buying control of New Zealand's largest travel
company - Atlantic and Pacific Travel.</p>

<p>Manufacturers' and Retailers' Acceptance Company (in 1970 changed
to <ent type = 'person'>Marac</ent>): This firm specialises in leasing and factoring (buying
debts at a discount). It also finances imports and exports. The
major shareholders are the Fletcher Group (38.0%), the Commercial
Bank of Australia Ltd (24.7%), NIMU Insurance (7.7%), Phillips
Electrical (3.8%), National Mutual Life Association (2.4%), New
Zealand United Corporation (4.0%). The CBA is a partner in the
supranational Euro-Pacific Corporation, the other partners being
the Midland Bank (UK), the United California Bank (USA), Fuji
(Japan) and Societe Generale de Banque (France).</p>

<p>Early 1971: Onassis and Rockefeller begin global operation to buy
influence for the One World Government concept. They use Lockheed,
Northrop and Litton Industries 'agent' <ent type = 'person'>Adnan <ent type = 'person'>Khashoggi</ent></ent>, to
organise operations in the Middle East, Iran and Indonesia. I.C.I.
set up $2.5 million slush fund to Australia and N.Z.</p>

<p>Finance Minister <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> changes law to allow Mafia-controlled
banks to begin operations in New Zealand. Links also made by
N.Z.I. in preparation for Paxus control with Hong Kong and
Shanghai; Wells Fargo with Broadbank; Chase Manhattan with General
Finance; Bank of America and Barclays with <ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent> and Renouf in
New Zealand United Corp. All members of the Business Round Table
Organisation.</p>

<p>Late 1971: Gulf Oil and their man <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent> begin organising chains
of Shell companies and dummy corporations to conceal their
takeover operations of oil, gas and mineral resources and related
industries such as vehicle franchises, vehicle spare parts and
finance services - all part of the Seven Sisters' controlled car
culture.</p>

<p>To extend links to the US banking operations they buy control of
I.S.A.S.  (NSW) and I.S.A.S. (Qld), which hold sole franchise for
construction and mining equipment produced by International
Harvester Credit Co, which is part of Chase Manhattan Bank and
associated with First National Bank Chicago (Chairman <ent type = 'person'>Sullivan</ent>
also Executive Vice-President of Chase Manhattan), Continental
Illinois (linked with CIA and Mafia <ent type = 'person'>Michele Sindona</ent> of Vatican
Bank) and Rockefeller's Standard Oil of Indiana (AMOCO).</p>

<p>I.S.A.S. (Qld) also has strategic holdings in North Flinders
Mines, Flinders Petroleum, Apollo International Minerals.</p>

<p>February 1972: Onassis and Rockefeller help associate Adnan
<ent type = 'person'>Khashoggi</ent> buy the Security Pacific National Bank in California and
take control of the United California Bank through CIA-linked
Lockheed Aircraft Corporation.  Both banks used by Onassis and
<ent type = 'person'>Khashoggi</ent> to funnel bribes and payoffs via the CIA's Deak Bank to
captive Japanese and other crooked politicians.  Security Pacific
also used to 'launder' over $2 million for <ent type = 'person'>Nixon</ent>'s re-election
campaign.  <ent type = 'person'>Khashoggi</ent> also buys 21% of Southern Pacific Properties,
which is the major stockholder in Travelodge (Aust), thereby
establishing direct links to New Zealand, and U.E.B. and <ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent>
through its equity links with Travelodge (N.Z.).</p>

<p>April 1972: Mafia banking operations expanded through New Hebrides
with establishment of Australian International Ltd to finance
Pacific development by the oil companies (Seven Sisters). Banks
involved include Irving Trust NY, Bank of Montreal, Crocker
International, Australia &amp; N.Z.  Bank and the Mitsubishi Bank,
whose president, <ent type = 'person'>Nakamaru</ent>, is appointed Chairman.</p>

<p>26th May, 1972: <ent type = 'person'>Gerald <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent></ent> installs <ent type = 'person'>Michele Sindona</ent> as 'owner'
of Franklin National Bank, helped by the Gambino Mafia family and
<ent type = 'person'>David <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent></ent> - Chairman of Continental Illinois Bank and <ent type = 'person'>Nixon</ent>'s
Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

Vice-President <ent type = 'person'>Shigeo Nagano</ent> also chairman of Nippon Steel and
member of Onassis and other World Government organisations.
Chairman of NZ sub-committee, J.  <ent type = 'person'>Mowbray</ent> is also GenehAo National B</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <ent type = 'person'>Michele Sindona</ent>, acting as the go-between for the Mafia
and the CIA, was the conduit between US and European banks.
<ent type = 'person'>Michele Sindona</ent>'s Vatican Bank and associate Calvi's Abrosiano
Bank was used to finance CIA neo-fascist Italian/Latin American
operations through Licio Gelli's P2 Lodge, which helped to
organise the 'death squads' of Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. This
aided the P2 -@+%rs sukh!as <ent type = 'person'>Klaus Barbie</ent> ('The <ent type = 'person'>Butcher</ent> of Lyonsf,(" Rega 
organiser of the A.A.A. in
Argentina.</p>

<p>Aoh August, 1972: Gulf Oil associate <ent type = 'person'>Bob <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent></ent> helps establish
new banking operation, first NZ international banks include Bank
of New Zealand, D.F.C. (Aust), N.Z.I., Morgan Guaranty Trust,
<ent type = 'person'>Morgan Grenfel</ent> and S.F.  Warburg.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent> begins expansion overseas with deals signed in
Indonesia, Fiji and New Guinea.</p>

<p>December 1972: <ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> elected Prime Minister of New Zealand.</p>

<p>February, 1973: <ent type = 'person'>Gerald <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent></ent>, <ent type = 'person'>William <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent></ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent>, Frank
<ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Bob <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent></ent> move to further consolidate the Mafia banking
operations.  In NZ they acquire 20% Fletcher subsidiary <ent type = 'person'>Marac</ent>,
using the Security Pacific National Bank helped by <ent type = 'person'>Marac</ent> Corporate
secretary <ent type = 'person'>Alan <ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent></ent>.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Frank <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent></ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent> use Fletcher and Renouf and their NZ
United Corporation to link with I.E.L. and <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent> Investments
through cross-shareholding agreement.</p>

<p>In Australia, the <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank begins operations with 30% of
the stock held by A'asian and Pacific Holdings (100% Chase
Manhattan Bank), 25% by CIA's Air America (known as 'Air Opium'),
25% by South Pacific Properties and 20% held by <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> and
Hand.</p>

<p>The Irving Trust Bank's New York Branch establishes US links
between the CIA and <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand, a worldwide network of 22 banks
set up to:</p>

<p>a) 'launder' money from Onassis heroin operations in the Golden
Triangle and Iran;
b) as a CIA funnel to pro-US political parties in Europe and Latin
America, including <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent>'s P2;
c) a spying conduit for information from Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam
and Thailand;
d) finance arms smuggled to Libya, Indonesia, South America,
Middle East and Rhodesia using the CIA's Edward Wilson.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Kissinger</ent> use key CIA and Naval Intelligence officers to
oversee the operation, including <ent type = 'person'>Walter McDonald</ent> (former Deputy
Director CIA), Dale Holmgren (Flight Service Manager CIA Civil Air
Transport), <ent type = 'person'>Robert Jansen</ent> (former CIA Station Chief, Bangkok) etc.</p>

<p>Heroin flown into Australia by CIA's Air America and trans-shipped
to Onassis lieutenant in Florida, <ent type = 'person'>Santos Trafficante Jr</ent>, assisted
by Australian Federal Bureau of Narcotics officials and
co-ordinated by CIA's <ent type = 'person'><ent type = 'person'>Ray</ent> <ent type = 'person'>Cline</ent></ent>.</p>

<p>14th June, 1973: Inauguration of the Onassis shadow World
Government - the Trilateral Commission. Includes over 200 members from the U
S,
Europe and Japan - bankers, government officials, transnational
corporations' top executives, trade unionists, etc. Of the world's
largest corporations, 24 directly represented and dozens more
through interlocking directorships.</p>

<p>* Trilateralist strategy: monopolisation of the world's resources,
production facilities, labour technology, markets, transport and
finance. These aims backed up by the US military and industrial
complexes that are already controlled and backed up by the CIA.</p>

<p>18th August, 1973: <ent type = 'person'><ent type = 'person'>Ray</ent> <ent type = 'person'>Cline</ent></ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent> meet in Adelaide to
discuss CIA plan to establish spying operations in NZ.</p>

<p>September 1973: Seagrams, with strong links to Chase Manhattan
Bank of Montreal and Toronto Dominion Bank, buys 2,800 acres of
prime land in Marlborough helped by Peter Maslen.</p>

<p>17th February, 1974: Mafia sets up New Hebrides Bank - Commercial
Pacific Trust Co (COMPAC). Banks include CBA, Europacific Finance
Corporation, Trustee Executors and Agency Co, Fuji Bank, Toronto
Dominion Bank, European Asian Bank and United California Bank,
COMPAC to be used as a cover for heroin dollar laundering
operations.</p>

<p>26th February, 1974: <ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent> meets <ent type = 'person'>Bob <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent></ent> in Wellington to
implement plans for the CIA's new spying operation - countries
targeted include France, Chile, West Germany and Israel.</p>

<p>Using the <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent>/<ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent> Investment funnel, <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent> buys building in
Willeston Street which will be rented to France and Chile, another
at Plimmer Steps to house West Germany and Israel.</p>

<p>CIA will set up eavesdropping communications centre inside the
Willeston Street building and another at 163 The Terrace which
will link with equipment installed in the Plimmer Steps building.
Four CIA technicians will run the whole operation.</p>

<p>April 1974: Finance Minister <ent type = 'person'>Rowling</ent> appoints <ent type = 'person'>Ron Trotter</ent> to the
Overseas Investment Commission, whose chairman, G. Lau, is also a
member of the <ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> Foundation (Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent>) investment board.</p>

<p>Whitlam and <ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent></p>

<p>Mid-1974: Gough Whitlam and Norman <ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> begin a series of moves
absolutely against the Mafia Trilateralists. Whitlam refuses to
waive restrictions on overseas borrowings to finance Alwest
Aluminium Consortium of <ent type = 'person'>Rupert Murdoch</ent>, BHP and R.J. Reynolds.
Whitlam had also ended Vietnam War support, blocked uranium mining
and wanted more control over US secret spy bases - e.g. Pine Gap.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> had introduced a new, tough Anti-Monopoly Bill and had tried
to redistribute income from big companies to the labour force
through price regulation and a wages policy.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> had also rejected plans to build a second aluminium smelter
near Dunedin and was preparing the Petroleum Amendment Bill to
give more control over New Zealand oil resources.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> had found out that <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent> Petroleum, drilling in the Great
South Basin, had discovered a huge resource of oil comparable in
size to the North Sea or Alaskan North Slope. Gas reserves alone
now estimated at 30 times bigger than Kapuni and oil reserves of
at least 20 billion barrels - enough for New Zealand to be
self-sufficient for years. Oil companies completely hushed up
these facts. To have announced a vast new oil source would
probably mean a decline in world oil prices, which would not have
allowed OPEC and Onassis plans for the Arabs to eventuate. N.Z.
could be exploited at a later date, particularly since the North
Sea operations were about to come on stream - <ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> was the last to
hold out.</p>

<p>September, 1974: According to CIA sources, <ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> was killed by the
Trilateralists using Sodium Morphate. <ent type = 'person'>Rowling</ent>'s first act as NZ
Prime Minister was to withdraw <ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent>'s Anti-Monopoly Bill and the
Petroleum Amendment Bill.</p>

<p>Later, <ent type = 'person'>Rowling</ent> was to be rewarded with ambassadorship to
Washington.  Incidentally, the Shah of Iran was murdered the same
way as <ent type = 'person'>Kirk</ent> on his arrival in the US.</p>

<p>6th October, 1974: <ent type = 'person'>Ray</ent> cline implements <ent type = 'person'>William <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent></ent> plan to oust
Australian Prime Minister Whitlam. <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank finances
payoffs to <ent type = 'person'>Malcolm Fraser</ent> and other pro-US politicians. A joint
bugging operation commences between CIA and ASIA.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Rupert Murdoch</ent>, playing his part, uses his newspapers and
television network to spread lies and misinformation. Whitlam, as
well as refusing to waive restrictions on overseas borrowing to
finance the aluminium consortium, had plans to ensure that all
corporations were at least 50% Australian-owned. This interfered
with the Seven Sisters' plans to build three oil refineries at
Cape Northumberland in South Australia to exploit the Great South
Basin discovery.</p>

<p>December, 1974: Australian Governor-General <ent type = 'person'>John <ent type = 'person'>Kerr</ent></ent> joins <ent type = 'person'>Ray</ent>
<ent type = 'person'>Cline</ent>'s payroll and received his first pay-off of $US200,000
credited to his account number 767748 at the Singapore branch of
the <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank.</p>

<p>11th November, 1975: Governor-General <ent type = 'person'>Kerr</ent> sacks the Whitlam
Government.</p>

<p>August 1975: <ent type = 'person'>Rowling</ent> re-introduces unrecognisable Commerce Bill,
designed to aid monopolisation of the NZ economy and repeals the
News Media Ownership Act, allowing more foreign ownership of NZ
media. The new legislation does not define monopoly, competition
or stipulate permissable maximum market share, or even ascertain
what the public interest is - resulting in a sell-out to big business.</p>

<p>December, 1975: Election battle between <ent type = 'person'>Rowling</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent>. Oil
companies pour thousands of dollars into <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent>'s campaign via
National Bank (NZ), whose general manager <ent type = 'person'>Mowbray</ent> is also a member
of <ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> Foundations; Investment Board Director Tudhope also Managing
Director Shell Oil and Chairman Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent>. <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> wins.</p>

<p>February, 1976: <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> implements pre-election secret agreement
with the NZ Seven Sisters' oil representatives of Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent>
for helping finance the National Party campaign.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> removes the $3 per barrel oil levy for the New Zealand
Refining Company, which increases the oil companies' profits by
100% at the taxpayers' expense and with all future oil prospecting licenses,
the Government has the option to take 51% of any discovery without
meeting exploration costs. This is designed to discourage further
exploration, thereby keeping the lid on the Great South Basin
discovery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Australia, new P.M. <ent type = 'person'>Malcolm Fraser</ent> reopens uranium
mining and opens the way for takeover of mineral resources with
big tax breaks for oil exploration, coal and mining.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> returns a favour to the oil companies by arranging $US200
million loan for Maui Gas Development for Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent>.</p>

<p>September, 1976: With captive politicians in place in both
Australia and New Zealand, the Internationalists can now proceed
with their strategy of takeover of the economy and exploitation of
natural resources. "In New Zealand, the elimination of unnecessary
competition is fundamental to a sound economy," <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent> says.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Parksy</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent> use <ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent>/<ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent> Investments as a vehicle to buy
into A.B. Consolidated Holdings in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Associate of R. <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent>, Pat Goodman, is appointed 'consultant' of
A'asian and Pacific Holdings.</p>

<p>November, 1976: The Internationalists (Mafia) set up a NZ money
'funnel' using Brierley's City Realties. National Insurance Co
acquires 33% of the stock. Largest stockholders in National
Insurance are the US Firemen's Fund
- Chairman and President <ent type = 'person'>Myron <ent type = 'person'>Du Bain</ent></ent> also Vice Chairman of
American Express (Amex). Chairman of I.E.L. linked International
Harvester, <ent type = 'person'>Archie McCardell</ent>, also Amex Director. Amex linked with
Chase Manhattan and seven Sisters' Texaco and Mobil. <ent type = 'person'>Du Bain</ent> also
Director of CIA-linked United California Bank, which is a partner
in Commercial Pacific Trust.</p>

<p>To complete the money funnel, National Insurance becomes a
stockholder in Chase Manhattan's Chase-NBA.
Brierley's declared assets reach $100 million, with shareholder's
capital of only $2.5 million - all cash acquisitions.</p>

<p>3rd February, 1977: <ent type = 'person'>Parksy</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent> close down the Brierley/<ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent>
Investment funnel and open up seperate channels for Brierley and
<ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent>.  <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent> will be supplied with 'laundered' funds via Sydney
branch of the <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank, while for Ron Brierley, Gerald
<ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent> uses <ent type = 'person'>Myron <ent type = 'person'>Du Bain</ent></ent>, Dierctor of United California Bank and
also chairman and president of the US Firemen's Fund, which are
the largest stockholders in National Insurance (NZ). Funds to be
'laundered' via Chase Manhattan Bank through National Insurance to
City Realty and via United California Bank through
COMPAC (New Hebrides) to National Insurance and City Realties.</p>

<p>To expand the Bierley/I.E.L. 'front', <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent> establishes
Industrial Equity Pacific (Hong Kong).</p>

<p>September 1977: Brierley's new holding company begins operations -
A.B.  Consolidated. H.W. Revell appointed Deputy Chairman and B.
Hancox General Manager, while newly-appointed directors include S.
Cushing, B.  Judge, O. <ent type = 'person'>Gunn</ent> and P. Goodman, linked with Renouf,
Fletcher and Papps through I.E.L./N.Z.U.C.</p>

<p>* Strategy: To target and divide key sectors of the economy for
takeover, exploitation and monopolisation. Operations to extend to
use Hong Kong facility, I.E.P. <ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent> to extend the
<ent type = 'person'>Khashoggi</ent>/Rockefeller Travelodge operation by taking holdings in
Vacation Hotels and Intercontinental Properties (Renouf
Chairman).</p>

<p>October, 1977: <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> and JOhn <ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> - Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> - sign an
agreement.  NZ Govt would take 24.5% holding in the Great South
Basin for $1.65 Billion.  <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent> would reduce his holding from 45.5%
to 27.5% and Arco would sell its 6.5%.</p>

<p>* Reason: <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent> did not possess the technology to pump oil from
deep water; Gulf possessed the technology but did not tell <ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent>.
Arco was not told anything and were swindled out of its 6.5% concession.</p>

<p>November, 1977:  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> introduces the S.I.S Amendment Bill,
designed to keep the economy free of obstruction and to help
uncover obstructive elements.  Telephone taps, mail tampering and
other surveillance methods approved after CIA input on contents of
legislation.</p>

<p>Late 1977:  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> travels to the US to meet top Rockefeller
officials, including Trilateralists' Deputy Secretary of State,
<ent type = 'person'>Warren Christopher</ent>, and <ent type = 'person'>Richard Bolbrooke</ent>, who were in charge of
the new "South Pacific Desk" at the State Department established
by Rockefeller to target exploitatin of both New Zealand and
Australia.  In Los Angeles, <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> meets top Rockefeller
officials, Robert Anderson (Rockwell Chairman, also Director of
Kashoggi's Security Pacific National Bank) and P. Larkin (Rockwell
Director, also Chairman, Executive Committee Security Pacific
National Bank and Director of <ent type = 'person'>Marac</ent>).</p>

<p>April, 1978:  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> sets up Petrocorp.  New Zealand taxpayers
pay for the exploration costs but the oil companies control all
distribution outlets.  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> blocks development of Maui B as
restructured supplies mean higher prices and bigger profits for
Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent>.  South Island gas market not developed as Great
South Basin fields closer than Kapuni.  Plans develop for
re-opening of National Parks for mineral exploitation.</p>

<p>22nd July, 1978: Director of Australian Federal Bureau of
Narcotics suspends his invetigation into the <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank after
pressure from the CIA and Australian politicians controlled by
Mafia, particularly <ent type = 'person'>Malcolm Fraser</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Brierly</ent>'s declared assets reach $200 million, with shareholders'
funds only $17 million.</p>

<p>May, 1979: Trilateral Commission secretary <ent type = 'person'>Zbignieu <ent type = 'person'>Brzezinski</ent></ent>
appoints <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> chairman of Board of Governors of IMF/World Bank
on orders of
<ent type = 'person'>David Rockefeller</ent>.  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> would head three-man administration
committee which included Canadian Finance Minister <ent type = 'person'>Mitchell Sharp</ent>,
key figure in the Mafia Council and the Trilateral Commission.
Australian <ent type = 'person'>Treasurer McMahon</ent> also involved.</p>

<p>8th June, 1979: <ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Frank <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent></ent>, Brierley and James
Fetcher meet in Hand's Sydney penthouse to discuss the
establishment of the New Zealand Mafia organisation.</p>

<p>Mid- 1979: Gulf Oil using its man Brierley, begins operations
designed to capture key sectors of the economy.  A.B Consolidated
restructured into the Goodman Group and Goodman to run operations
but with the majority of the stock held by IEL and Brierley using
Shell companies plus dummy corporations.</p>

<p>* Strategy:  To take over food and produce resources, Brierley and
Fletcher restructured a small private company, H.W. Smith, using
<ent type = 'person'>Cyril Smith</ent> as Chairman but with key executives Judge, <ent type = 'person'>Collins</ent> and
<ent type = 'person'>McKenzie</ent>. <ent type = 'person'>Bob <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent></ent> helps.</p>

<p>Private company used, as no Commerce Commission control, accounts
not published, no public disclosure of transactions.  Bunting is
established as a shell company and the South Island is targeted
for asset-stripping and takeover, as well as key sectors of the
automobile industry.</p>

<p>Unlimited funds channelled through City Realties, NZUC and <ent type = 'person'>Marac</ent>.
UEB extends Travelodge operations by buying control of
Transholdings, which has strategic holdings in Vacation Hotels and

<p>17th August, 1979:  New Zealand Mafia inaugral meeting in Sydney
including Hand, Brierley, Fletcher, Goodman, R.Trotter, Alan
<ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent> and L.Papps.</p>

<p>Key sectors of the economy would be taken over- food, using
Goodman; forestry and farming, using Fletcher and Trotter;
property, using Brierley and <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent>.  Brierley, Hand and Papps
would be responsible for banking, insurance and finance, while
Hand and <ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent> would be responsible for setting up new "laundry"
channels into New Zealand.</p>

<p>The economy would be taken over using cheap loans of less than 5%,
while consumers would pay 28%.</p>

<p>October, 1979:  BP Oil begis $100 million joint venture deal with
Fletcher and Trotter at Tasman.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> makes secret deal with oil companies which effectively
robs New Zealand taxpayers by giving Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> the Maui Gas
deal.  Normally the granting of drilling rights on public land is
done using a worldwide system which incorporates an auction tender
system.  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> bypassed this. Also, Shell/BP/<ent type = 'person'>Todd</ent> pays no tax
on Kapuni profits, while putting funds into Maui development.</p>

<p>19th November, 1979:  Secret meeting in Auckland between <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent>,
Fletcher and Trotter to transfer 43% Tasman Pulp and Paper held by
New Zealand Government to Challenge Corporation (Chairman Trotter)
and <ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent>.  Tasman has lucrative 75-year contract for cheap
timber signed in 1955.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> paid off with a $1 million 'non-repayable' loan - $500,000
to be paid into account number 8746665 at New Hebrides branch of
the Australian International Bank.</p>

<p>November, 1979:  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> drops restrictions on foreign investment.

Hill goldmine.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> unveils the Government's plans (instructed by Rockefeller)
to form New Zealand into an offshore production base for the
multi-national corporations as benefits include government export
incentives, stable government, cheap labour, and so on.</p>

<p>27th November, 1979:  <ent type = 'person'>Gerald <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent></ent>'s lieutenant, <ent type = 'person'>David <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent></ent>,
meets <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> to deliver $US100,000 cash to <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> for
implementing the Internationalists' Mafia Think Big plans.</p>

<p>These plans began with big contracts and guaranteed profits for
the Seven Sisters, Bechtel, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Nippon Steel,
Internationalists' Mafia banks.</p>

<p>With the experimental petroleum plant, the oil price has to be
$50/barrel to be profitable, yet Mobil's profits are guaranteed.</p>

<p>New Zealand Steel is to be expanded 500%, even though there was a
global steel glut of 50%.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent> own 10% of New Zealand Steel and are majority
stockholders in Pacific Steel and control monopoly over wire rod,
reinforcing steel.  Aslo, New Zealand taxpayers subsidise
<ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent>' profits.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> introduces the National Development Bill with 'fast-track'
legislation, to keep the economy 'free of obstruction' for
long-term monopolisation.</p>

<p>C.E.R. plan introduced, designed to integrate the economies of
Australia and New Zealand with the Trilateral Commission for the
purpose of exploiting the South Pacific countries and as a
'back-door' entrance into China - the world's largest untapped
consumer market.  New Zealand is also the closest country to
Antarctica, which has a vast mineral resource for future
exploitation.</p>

<p>"Think Big" projects begin, even though <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> aware of studies
that show New Zealand could conserve up to 40% of energy
consumption using existing technology, which would mean funds
could be invested elsewhere to lower consumer prices, lower
inflation rates, less demand for imported oil and increased
imployment by creating new industry to manufacture and install
energy-saving technology.  None of these options seriously
considered as all would lessen profits for members of the
Rockefeller organisations.</p>

<p>December 1979:  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> unveils 'stage two' of a four-stage plan
to exploit the Great South Basin discovery.  Plan prepared by
Trilateralist 'Think Tank' - the Brookings Institute.</p>

<p>'Stage Two' includes methanol plant and synthetic petrol plant,
which would initially use gas from the Maui field and later would
link with underwater gas pipe from Campbell Island.</p>

<p>With the New Zealand Steel 500% expansion, 'stage three' of the
project and Think Big contracts to go to Bechtel, Fluor Corp.,
Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Nippon Steel, etc.  All investments would be
financed by the New Zealand taxpayer.</p>

<p>17th January, 1980:  $500,000 deposited in <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent>'s account
number 8746665 at the Australian International Bank, being the
final payment for the Tasman deal.</p>

<p>May, 1980:  Mafia's <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand banking operation crashes after
<ent type = 'person'>Frank <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent></ent> killed.  <ent type = 'person'>Death</ent> ruled as suicide even though no
fingerprints found on the rifle.  Maloney, Houghton, Yates and
Hand shred important documents, but miss some.  CIA helps Hand and
Bank President <ent type = 'person'>Donald Beasley</ent> escape to the U.S.  The CIA and
Australian Security Intelligence Organisation cover everything up.
<ent type = 'person'>Beazley</ent> appointed President of Miami City National Bank, run by
<ent type = 'person'>Alberto Dugue</ent> for 'laundering' profits from the CIA Colombian
cocaine operation.</p>

<p>There is a probability that <ent type = 'person'>Michael Hand</ent> killed <ent type = 'person'>Frank <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent></ent>
because of his involvement with Hand's fiancee.</p>

<p>25th May, 1980:  <ent type = 'person'>Colby</ent> arrived in Australia to discuss replacement
of the <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank with Hand, Brierley, and <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent>.  Immediate
funding available from Sydney branch of the Deak Bank, a separate
CIA operation, and IEL would be used to buy NZI Corp., to prepare
for future laundering operations.</p>

<p>Maloney, Houghton, Yates, and Hand would shred all documents
leading back to the New Zealand Great South Basin connection, and
the CIA would help Hand and Bank President Donald <ent type = 'person'>Beazley</ent> escape
to the USA.  The CIA and ASIO would also cover everything up.</p>

<p>Hand and <ent type = 'person'>Beazley</ent> turn up in Miami - <ent type = 'person'>Beazley</ent> appointed President
and Hand 'consultant' to the Miami City National Bank, but also
Hand turned up in El Salvador to help organise bankrolling of the
Contras with other ex- members of <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent>-Hand.</p>

<p>23rd June, 1980:  New Zealand Mafia, including Brierley, Fletcher,
Trotter, <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent>, Goodman, and Papps meet in Wellington to
discuss merger of Fletcher Challenge and Tasman.</p>

<p>In order to replace <ent type = 'person'>Nugan</ent> Hand Bank's 22 world-wide branches,
quick moves are made to buy control of NZI by New Zealand Mafia
using Brierley, thereby capturing an established, world-wide
organisation through the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, which is
also linked to the CIA through its subsidiary, World Finance
Corporation.</p>

<p>Late 1980:  <ent type = 'person'>Fletchers</ent>, with strong Rockefeller links, obtains
lucrative contracts on US Bases in the Pacific and joint ventures
in Saudi Arabia and Iraq.</p>

<p>Control extended over New Zealand natural resources - Fletcher

was an old family partner of <ent type = 'person'>Paul Helliwell</ent> (CIA paymaster for the
Bay of Pigs' fiasco) and had helped the <ent type = 'person'>Pritzker</ent> family set up tax
shelters using the CIA's Mercantile Bank and Trust and the Castle
Bank, which ahd been set up by Helliwell for 'laundering' profits
from the Onassis heroin operations as well as 'skim money' from
the Hughes casino operations in Las Vegas.</p>

<ent type = 'person'>Gunn</ent>.  NZOG launched with strategic holdings by <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent>, Renouf and
Brierley with licences in PPD 38206 and 38204 - both next to
<ent type = 'person'>Hunt</ent>'s Great South Basin discovery, NZOG also controls 80 million

<p>In Australia, the Mafia Council will monopolise the economy with
company takeovers through the use of loans at less than 5%.</p>

<p>Holme's A'Court's company would be taken over using Security
Pacific National Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank, with some of the
stock being held in London.</p>

<p>Equiticorp will be launched using <ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent>, with 50% of the stock

US Equiticorp to registered in Hong Kong to cover up true
ownership, and will use the same laundry as Chase Corporation -
<ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent> will set up a maze of shell companies and dummy
organisations to disguise operations.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent> previously associated with Kashoggi when Corporate

stockholding in CBA Finance, which is a partner in Commercial
Pacific Trust with United California Bank, <ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent> forms umbrella

Wellington and agrees to go on the Mafia payroll for monthly fee
of $UA40,000 paid into account number 5263161 at Commercial
Pacific Trust, New Hebrides.</p>

<p>March 1984:  <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> knighted with GCMG for keeping the economy
free of obstructions for easier takeover and exploitation.</p>

<p>24th May, 1984:  Four-man CIA team co-ordinated by <ent type = 'person'><ent type = 'person'>Ray</ent> <ent type = 'person'>Cline</ent></ent>
arrive in New Zealand to begin installation of equipment for
subliminal television advertising at five sites - Waiatarua, Mt
Erin, Kaukau, Sugarloaf and Obelisk.</p>

<p>Sophisticated equipment can be installed within one kilometer of
TV relay arrials and all linked to one IDAPS computer bureau in
Auckland.</p>

<p>Same equipment installed in Australia August 1985; Japan September
1986; UK February 1987: New York 1987.  Also, Amax geoligists now
estimate <ent type = 'person'>Martha Hill</ent> gold source could be worth up to $30 billion
on strength of high gold/tonne ore assay.</p>

<p>17th July, 1984:  In New Zealand, subliminal advertising begins on
Channel Two between 6pm and midnight - hours later extended to
begin at noon.  Subliminal messages prepared in the US by the CIA
and with New Zealand election imminent, tell voters to support the
Labour Party, the New Zealand Party and to buy Mafia company
products.</p>

<p>New Zealand Party was formed to ensure that <ent type = 'person'>Muldoon</ent> would lose, as
Big Business unhappy with controls over economy.  Big campaign
contributions from Brierley, the oil companies and the Business
Round Table ensure a Labour victory.</p>

<p>Later, <ent type = 'person'>Lang</ent>e agrees to repay the favour to Brierley by selling the
Government holding in the Kariori Pulp Mill to Winstones.  New
Zealand taxpayer loses $100 million.</p>

<p>Government then becomes the arm of big business, using economic
policies provided by the  Business Round Table, implemented by
Finance Minister Roger <ent type = 'person'>Douglas</ent> and the package being sold by David
<ent type = 'person'>Lang</ent>e, who also keeps up a noisy CIA directed ANZUS withdrawal
campaign.</p>

<p>* Reason:  1) ANZUS  Treaty did not cover Mafia requirements over
the Great South Basin discovery;  2) To identify any oppositin or
threats within New Zealand who align themselves with supposed
Government policy, <ent type = 'person'>Lang</ent>e increases the SIS budget and strangthens
links with the CIA.</p>

<p>Brookings Institute are the actual designers of the New Zealand
Government econmomic policies provided by the Business Round Table
(NZ Mafia front) and implented by the Government.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Douglas</ent> devalues the dollar and deregulates interest rates, which
means cheaper labour, cheaper capital assets and high mortgage
rates, thereby implementing Big Business policy of driving farmers
off the land, establshment of the corporate farm and eventually
remove viability of small business sector, etc.</p>

<p>27th September, 1984: New Zealand Mafia meets at new 'safe
house' registered under <ent type = 'person'>Fernyhough</ent>'s name, in Auckland.  Those

International Vice President of the Trilateral Commission Pacific
Basin Economic Council.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent>, Brierley and <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent> hold a separate meeting with <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent>,
outlining plans for an expanded laundry operation which will
coincide with the launch of 'Crack' - a new addictive product
developed by CIA chemists for the world market.</p>

<p>Equiticorp (Aust) will be launched with <ent type = 'person'>Adler</ent> as Manager and a new
merchant bank using Eldrs, Goodman and Jarden.</p>

<p>IEI will merge with Armco Bank, which has 20 branches in South
East Asia; <ent type = 'person'>Ariadne</ent> will acquire the Bank of Queensland, and
Brierley Investments will form a cross-shareholding with NZI Corp
to further increase control by their Mafia organisation.  Other
plans include the laundering of funds directly to the New Zealand
and Australian Governments and the establishment of key companies
within the economies of New Zealand, Australia and Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The first key company will control the food industry in
Australasia through merger of Elders, Goodmans, Allied Mills,
<ent type = 'person'>Fielder Gillespie</ent> and Watties.  Allied Mills will control 30%
Goodmans, 30% Fielder, 20% Watties and will expand into Europe via
acquisition of Rank, Hovis McDougall (UK).  Allied Mills will be
controlled through IEL.</p>

operation, Trotter and Fletcher help establish the 'Pacific
Investment Fund' with Australian and New Zealand investments to be
managed by Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank subsidiary, <ent type = 'person'>Wardley</ent> and the

A'Court - discussed strategy for merger of Goodman, Allied Mills,
Fielde Gillespie Davis, Watties and Elders with Chase Manhattan
Bank taking 20%, Elders and IEL 10%, with stock being held through
Chase-AMP Bank.</p>

<p>Elders woul be used as major 'vehicle' in the global liquor
economy with Courage Brewery in the UK to be used as entry into
Europe.</p>

<p>Strategy finalised to take over BHP, Australia's largest company,
using Holme's A'Court, Brierley, <ent type = 'person'>Elliott</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Hawkins</ent>.</p>

<p>In London, Chase Manhattan would takeover stockbrokers Simon &amp;
Coates who specialise in A'Asia Mafia owned companies such as
Fletcher Challenge, Brierley, NZI Corp, Elders, Bell Group and
BHP.  Chase Manhattan could then issue and buy stock to manipulate
the Australasian economy by increasing price, paying no taxes,
creating inflation, and enslaving the people through debt to mafia
controlled banks.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent> would oversee the 'launder' of further loans to the NZ
Government and would begin to channel 'loans' through the
Australian Treasury using captive politician <ent type = 'person'>Keating</ent>.  Also NZ
Government building would be sold to <ent type = 'person'>Jones</ent> and Australia
Government buildings would be sold to <ent type = 'person'>Adler</ent> which would then be
rented back to the respective Governments at inflated prices.</p>

<p>17th November 1986:  Brierley, <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent>, Packer, Bond, <ent type = 'person'>Elliott</ent>,

Bank.</p>

<p>At a separate meeting with Brierley, <ent type = 'person'>Seldon</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Cline</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Parsky</ent>
outlines plan for 'key' Media Australasian Holding company using
the Bell Group which would be taken over by with Chase Manhattan

<p><ent type = 'person'>Brzezinski</ent> outlines plans to invade Iran using 75,000 strong
mercenary army supported by US Air Force and Navy with starting
date of 8th February, 1988.  An integral part of the plan Saudi
and Kuwaiti oil tankers would fly the US flag to provoke an
Iranian attack so that US invasion of Iran would be 'justified'.</p>

<p>* Reason:  The Seven Sisters wanted to exploit a secret oil field
near <ent type = 'person'>Bandar Abbas</ent> discovered in 1976 with estimate 150 billion
barrels and also a huge gold source at Neyshabur discovered in
1977.</p>

<p>The Iranian invasion would begin after the World economic system
was collapsed by the mafia controlled banks - target date 17th
January 1988.  Other countries on the takeover list include:
 * Mexico - for oil at Baisas
 * Nicaragua - for oil at Connto
 * Colombia -  for gold at Papayan
 * South Korea - for gold at Chunchon
 * New Zealand - for oil in the Great South Basin.</p>

<p>(Obviously this part of the plan failed to happen)</p>
