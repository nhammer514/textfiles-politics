<p><ent type = 'person'>Skolnick</ent> COMMENTARY #008
========================</p>

<p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve 
either all or portions of the following.]</p>

<p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put 
out by a group in Chicago called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up 
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>

<p>Hi! <ent type = 'person'>Sherman Skolnik</ent>, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts, 
9800 Oglesby.</p>

<p>A major news agency has keys to the future of the <ent type = 'person'>Clinton</ent> White 
House.</p>

<p>THE DETAILS</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Hillary</ent> Rodham <ent type = 'person'>Clinton</ent> has been a law partner of Vincent <ent type = 'person'>Foster</ent>, 
jr., who became a White House aide. Earlier, <ent type = 'person'>Foster</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Hillary</ent>, 
as lawyers, arranged for Bank Lavoro, Atlanta, and their twin, 
Bank of Criminals and Conspirators International [BCCI], to get 
$4 billion to <ent type = 'person'>Saddam Hussein</ent> for weapons, including nuclear -- 
all disguised as U.S. agriculture loans, laundered through the 
[unclear] banking group and the <ent type = 'person'>Stevens</ent>(sp?) family, financially 
interlocked with the <ent type = 'person'>Clinton</ent>s.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Hillary</ent>, and <ent type = 'person'>Foster</ent>, were attorneys fronting for these Little 
Rock bankers -- largest bond brokers outside of Wall Street. The 
role of <ent type = 'person'>Foster</ent> was more than just personal lawyer for <ent type = 'person'>Bill</ent> and 
his wife. <ent type = 'person'>Foster</ent> was also <ent type = 'person'>Hillary</ent>'s lover -- sort of balancing 
off <ent type = 'person'>Bill</ent>'s episodes with the mistress. After all, all is fair in 
love and war.</p>

<p>The Resolution Trust Corporation [RTC] needed a new chief. 
Strange, but President <ent type = 'person'>Clinton</ent>, a purported Democrat, in July '93 
appointed a <ent type = 'person'>George Bush</ent> Republican, <ent type = 'person'>Stanley <ent type = 'person'>Tate</ent></ent>, to be RTC boss.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Clinton</ent> was blackmailed into it.</p>

<p>Yet <ent type = 'person'>Tate</ent> threatened a top-to-bottom corruption cleanup of this 
S&amp;L salvage agency [i.e. RTC]. A week later, <ent type = 'person'>Foster</ent> was murdered 
by three hit men from a German base.</p>

<p>A senate committee stonewalled <ent type = 'person'>Tate</ent>'s ratification, and he 
withdrew his name late in November '93.</p>

<p>And thereafter escalated the Madison Guaranty S&amp;L mess and the 
Whitewater Development scandal. In <ent type = 'person'>Foster</ent>'s office were 
incriminating records which were grabbed up to whitewash <ent type = 'person'>Hillary</ent>. 
It is an unanswered question whether <ent type = 'person'>Bill</ent> himself knew how <ent type = 'person'>Foster</ent> 
and <ent type = 'person'>Hillary</ent> siphoned off some $47 million from the S&amp;L.</p>

<p>To save <ent type = 'person'>Hillary</ent> from possible prison, <ent type = 'person'>Bill</ent> had key records 
suppressed and announced that <ent type = 'person'>Foster</ent> was a suicide. *Oh, yeah*?!</p>

<p>A fake, crumpled-up, so-called "suicide note" was later, 
supposedly, found in <ent type = 'person'>Foster</ent>'s suitcase.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Bill</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Hillary</ent>, by covering up the murder, have become 
accomplices to it -- a serious crime. (And some may think that 
what was cruel of her was to cover up the murder of her lover 
just to save herself.)</p>

<p>The major news group is deciding whether to go with these 
details, all documented to their satisfaction.</p>

<p>(AND: A close relative of Vice-President <ent type = 'person'>Albert <ent type = 'person'>Gore</ent></ent> has said 
that he [<ent type = 'person'>Gore</ent>] will become President soon.)</p>

<p>But they had problems:
1) The news group's stock has already been slipping. At the same 
time, release of this timely story would cause a crack in the 
stock market and a fall in the news group's shares. So, they 
hesitate -- at least at this time, anyway;
2) But -- if they don't go with this story [that] they already 
have, they would lose credibility with other, competing news 
groups [who] may run with it; and
3) The ultra-rich got what they want in pushing <ent type = 'person'>Clinton</ent>, a 
relative unknown and a perceived misfit, into high office. So why 
wreck him now? Well, because it opens a window of emergency and 
opportunity, and the ultra-rich can complete their rotten agenda 
of repression and hardship inflicted on the ordinary people.</p>
