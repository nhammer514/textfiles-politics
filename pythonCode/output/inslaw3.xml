   Murder in the Martinsburg Sheraton?
    By Joel Bleifuss</p>

<p>   For more than a year, Danny <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent>, a Washington D.C.-based
   freelance investigator, had been sorting through a web of intrigue-
   -the S&amp;L debacle, BCCI, Iran-Contra, the contra-connected Wackenhut
   Corp., the Wackenhut-connected Inslaw case, and the Inslaw-connected
   "October Surprise."
  According to one of his close friends, who asked not to be named,
   <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> began receiving death threats eight or nine months ago.
   "Brother, just make it quick," <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> is reported to have told one
   of these midnight callers.  The last threat came on Monday, August
   5, according to his brother, Anthony.
  How quick death came we may never know.  On Saturday, August 10,
   <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> was found dead in Room 517 of the Martinsburg, W. Va.,
   Sheraton.  His body was discovered with 12 incisions in his arms in
   a bathtub of bloody water 17 hours after he had called his mother's
   house at 6 p.m. Friday to say he was heading home but that he would
   not make it to his niece's birthday party.  On the following Monday
   Martinsburg authorities notified the family of <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent>'s death, but
   by then the body had been embalmed and the motel room had been
   sanitized by a cleaning contractor.  Officials are calling the
   incident an "unattended death" while they continue their
   investigation.  Family and friends say that suicide is out of the
   question.  They maintain that <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> was not a depressive type,
   and that while he did have financial problems, he did not dwell on
   them.
  According to family and friends, before leaving for Martinsburg,
   <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> had been ecstatic.  The pieces of the puzzle were finally
   fitting together.  He had told them he was going to West Virginia to
   meet a source who was to help him nail down a last piece of evidence
   in his investigation into the Inslaw software-theft case.
  Those close to <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> want many questions answered.  Where is
   his ever-present briefcase?  It was not in motel room.  Where is his
   tape deck?  It is missing.  Where were his notes and the outline of
   his proposed book, "Behold a Pale Horse," which he had shown to
   friends days before his death?  The documents were not to found in
   the Sheraton motel room or in the four boxes of his papers that the
   family turned over to ABC News.  Why did authorities wait so long to
   notify the family of his death?  His driver's license said he lived
   in Falls Church, Va., and all the <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent>s listed in the 703 area
   code are his relatives.  Why was his body embalmed before the family
   was notified?  West Virginia law requires family approval prior to
   embalming.  Who was the man who telephoned <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent>'s house on
   Saturday evening?  When a housekeeper picked up the phone, a voice
   said, "You're dead, you bastard."</p>

<p>   MOTIVE FOR MURDER?  What was <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> investigating that could have
   put his life in such danger?  <ent type = 'person'>David <ent type = 'person'>MacMichael</ent></ent> is a former CIA
   analyst who now directs the Washington office of the Association of
   National Security Alumni, a watchdog group.  <ent type = 'person'>MacMichael</ent> had talked
   to <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> on the phone on Thursday, the day he left for
   Martinsburg.  <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> had made an appointment to meet with him.
  Says <ent type = 'person'>MacMichael</ent>, "Providing the death was not a suicide, one can
   examine three scenarios."  First, <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> was developing a theory
   that a group of former intelligence officers were members of a for-
   profit cabal that <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> called "The Octopus."  According to his
   theory, over the past 25 years The Octopus had its tentacles in a
   number of international scandals.  <ent type = 'person'>MacMichael</ent> doesn't think such a
   far-fetched-sounding theory would get <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> killed.  "If you
   published their names, pictures and documents, what kind of book
   would you have?" asks <ent type = 'person'>MacMichael</ent>.  It would be dismissed, according
   to <ent type = 'person'>MacMichael</ent>, like "a UFO crank book."
  Second, <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> was looking into the October Surprise, the
   alleged deal between the 1980 <ent type = 'person'>Reagan</ent> presidential campaign and
   Iranians.  That his death would be connected to this investigation
   is "nonsense" says <ent type = 'person'>MacMichael</ent>, who explains that many journalists
   are now investigating the 1980 deal, making it unlikely that
   <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> had information significant enough to endanger his life.
  Which leads to the third scenario, that <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> was on his way
   to collect the final evidence needed to wrap up his investigation of
   a scandal that, as <ent type = 'person'>MacMichael</ent> put it, involves "real crimes, real
   people and real money"--the Inslaw case.  (See "In These Times," May
   29 ["Software Pirates" posted on-line previously].)</p>

<p>   INSLAW MEETS THE LAW:  For eight years, Inslaw Inc, has been
   battling the Justice Department for possession of Promis, an
   innovative case-management software program developed by company
   owner <ent type = 'person'>Bill Hamilton</ent>.  In 1986 Inslaw filed suit against the
   department in federal court, claiming the department had stolen the
   program.
  In September 1987, Judge <ent type = 'person'>George Bason</ent>, the federal bankruptcy
   judge from Washington, D.C., ruled, "The Department of Justice took,
   converted, stole Inslaw's enhanced Promis by trickery, fraud and
   deceit."  He also charged, "The failure even to begin in investigate
   [these charges] is outrageous and indefensible and constitutes an
   institutional decision by the Department of Justice at the highest
   level simply to ignore charges of impropriety."
  The Justice Department appealed the ruling, and in November 1989,
   Judge William B. <ent type = 'person'>Bryant</ent> of the U.S. District Court in Washington
   affirmed the lower court's decision.  He ruled, "The government
   acted willfully and fraudulently to obtain property that it was not
   entitled to under contract.
  The Justice Department then appealed <ent type = 'person'>Bryant</ent>'s ruling to the U.S.
   Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.  On May 7 that court
   overturned the previous court decisions, saying the federal
   bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.  However, the
   Court of Appeals left the findings of fact undisturbed.
  Earlier this year, the case took a new twist.  Inslaw went public
   with allegations that the <ent type = 'person'>Reagan</ent> Justice Department, after it had
   stolen the Promis software, turned it over to <ent type = 'person'>Earl <ent type = 'person'>Brian</ent></ent>, a friend
   of both former President Ronald <ent type = 'person'>Reagan</ent> and former Attorney General
   <ent type = 'person'>Edwin Meese</ent>.  In 1974, <ent type = 'person'>Brian</ent> left then-California Gov. <ent type = 'person'>Reagan</ent>'s
   cabinet.
  Inslaw alleges that its software was given to <ent type = 'person'>Brian</ent> as a payback
   for <ent type = 'person'>Brian</ent>'s help in arranging the arms-and-hostages deal between the
   1980 <ent type = 'person'>Reagan</ent>-<ent type = 'person'>Bush</ent> campaign and representatives of the Ayatollah
   Ruhollah Khomeini (see "In These Times," July 24, 1987, Oct. 12,
   1988, and April 27, 1991).  According to Inslaw owner <ent type = 'person'>Bill Hamilton</ent>,
   <ent type = 'person'>Brian</ent>, who runs United Press International, allegedly then marketed
   Promis to the intelligence agencies of Israel, Jordan, Iraq, Canada,
   South Korea, Libya, Great Britain, Germany, France, Australia,
   Thailand, Japan, Chile, Guatemala and Brazil.  According to Inslaw's
   scenario, once the software was in use by foreign intelligence
   services, the U.S. National Security Agency would then be able to
   infiltrate the computerized intelligence files of these countries.
   Modifications on the pirated software were allegedly carried out by
   the Wackenhut Corp. of Coral Gables, Fla.</p>

<p>   WHERE IS JUSTICE?:  Inslaw's attorney, Elliot <ent type = 'person'>Richardson</ent>, the <ent type = 'person'>Nixon</ent>
   attorney general who resigned rather than participate in the
   Watergate cover-up, has long asked for the appointment of a special
   prosecutor to investigate the Justice Department's handling of the
   case.  But to no avail.
  The House Judiciary Committee has been investigating the scandal
   since August 1989.  After months of foot-dragging, Attorney General
   <ent type = 'person'>Richard <ent type = 'person'>Thornburgh</ent></ent>, under subpoena by the committee, finally
   released Inslaw-related files.  However, according to a source in
   the House, 15 to 20 files are missing.
  "Washington Post" columnist <ent type = 'person'>Mary McGrory</ent> is one of the few
   mainstream journalists to give the Inslaw case serious attention.
   She wrote on August 18, "The man who could have resolved the Inslaw
   case, <ent type = 'person'>Dick <ent type = 'person'>Thornburgh</ent></ent>, resigned as attorney general on the day the
   West Virginia police came forward with their autopsy [on <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent>].
   Excess was the hallmark of the <ent type = 'person'>Thornburgh</ent>'s farewell ceremony:  an
   honor guard, a trooping of the colors, superlatives form
   subordinates.  William P. Barr, his deputy and possible successor,
   spoke of <ent type = 'person'>Thornburgh</ent>'s `leadership, integrity, professionalism and
   fairness'--none of which <ent type = 'person'>Thornburgh</ent> displayed in his handling of
   Inslaw.  What was merely sinister has now turned deadly.  <ent type = 'person'>Thornburgh</ent>
   calls Inslaw `a little contract dispute' and refused to testify
   about it to the House Judiciary Committee.  <ent type = 'person'>Richardson</ent> thinks it
   could be `dirtier than Watergate,' and, as a victim of the scandal,
   he should know.  <ent type = 'person'>Thornburgh</ent>'s conduct is the most powerful reason
   for believing that Danny <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent> really saw an octopus before he
   died."
  And in the wake of <ent type = 'person'>Casolaro</ent>'s death, <ent type = 'person'>Richardson</ent> has repeated his
   call for a special prosecutor.  He told the "Boston Globe"'s John
   Aloysius Farrell, "It's hard to come up with any reason for his
   death other than he was deliberately murdered because he was close
   to uncovering sinister elements in what he called `The Octopus.'
   This simply strengthens the case for an in-depth, hard-hitting,
   thorough investigation."
  But will there be one?  The FBI is treating the death lightly.
   According to a spokesman in the Pittsburgh office, which has
   jurisdiction over West Virginia, "There is no federal investigative
   interest in the matter."
  As for former Attorney General <ent type = 'person'>Thornburgh</ent>, he is now running for
   the Senate in Pennsylvania. If Justice is served, perhaps he will
   also run for cover.</p>
