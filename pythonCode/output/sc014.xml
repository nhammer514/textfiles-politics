<p><ent type = 'person'>Skolnick</ent> COMMENTARY #014
========================</p>

<p>[CfD Editor -- I neither necessarily believe nor disbelieve 
either all or portions of the following.]</p>

<p>[The following is a transcript of a recorded phone message put 
out by a group in Chicago called "Citizens' Committee to Clean Up 
the Courts." (312) 731-1100 and (312) 731-1505.]</p>

<p>Hi! Sherman <ent type = 'person'>Skolnick</ent>, Citizens' Committee to Clean Up the Courts, 
9800 South Oglesby.</p>

<p>Headquartered in Chicago is a law firm up to their eyeballs in 
the <ent type = 'person'>Clinton</ent> White House scandals: That's <ent type = 'person'>Hopkin</ent>s &amp; <ent type = 'person'>Sutter</ent>, with 
offices also in Washington, D.C. and Dallas.</p>

<p>Their major clients have included the federal deposit insurance 
and *their* stepsister, Resolution Trust Corp. [RTC]</p>

<p>The RTC is accused by some of being the principle whitewashing 
machine for CIA and members of congress implicated in the S&amp;L 
ripoff.</p>

<p>Strange, but <ent type = 'person'>Hopkin</ent>s &amp; <ent type = 'person'>Sutter</ent> or RTC chose the faraway Rose Law 
Firm in Little Rock to cover up a multi-million dollar mess of a 
defunct S&amp;L in a west suburb of Chicago. The dirty trick was done 
with Rose Law Firm partners <ent type = 'person'>Hillary</ent> <ent type = 'person'>Rodham</ent> <ent type = 'person'>Clinton</ent> and her 
partner, and lover, Vincent <ent type = 'person'>Foster</ent>, jr.</p>

<p>Details included jailbird and bond broker <ent type = 'person'>Dan Lassiter</ent>(sp?) whose 
business partner became a secretary to White House aide <ent type = 'person'>Foster</ent>. 
That secretary reportedly stole <ent type = 'person'>Foster</ent>'s files after he was 
murdered, and the documents are being used for blackmail in 
Chicago.</p>

<p>Uh, guess who has them? Why, <ent type = 'person'>Hopkin</ent>s &amp; <ent type = 'person'>Sutter</ent>.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Hopkin</ent>s &amp; <ent type = 'person'>Sutter</ent> partner <ent type = 'person'>Jay Steinberg</ent> reportedly has played a 
key role in secretly transferring a $50 million RTC contingency 
fund from Chicago to Little Rock. Some details are in a series of 
blockbuster federal cases here called "The Andrew Cetti Affair" 
(sp?).</p>

<p>All to try to patch up the $47 million bank embezzlement crisis 
pending before a federal grand jury. The accused target? Why, 
<ent type = 'person'>Hillary</ent> and "<ent type = 'person'>Sludge Willy</ent>."</p>

<p>A close <ent type = 'person'>Rodham</ent> family crony is <ent type = 'person'>John <ent type = 'person'>Gearham</ent></ent>(?), a lawyer in the 
northwest suburb of Park Ridge... where <ent type = 'person'>Hillary</ent> is from. In the 
presence of a witness, <ent type = 'person'>Gearham</ent> confessed to our [Citizen's 
Committee to Clean Up the Courts] chairman that <ent type = 'person'>Gearham</ent> fears 
being *himself* framed and sent to federal prison for the $50 
million secret transfer and the destruction of RTC records.</p>

<p>In simple terms, the murder of <ent type = 'person'>Foster</ent> and the disappearance of 
the RTC funds were to keep <ent type = 'person'>Hillary</ent> from going to prison.</p>

<p>At one time, <ent type = 'person'>Hopkin</ent>s &amp; <ent type = 'person'>Sutter</ent> were the major recipients of RTC 
legal fees. A recent statistic shows they were cut way back.</p>

<p>Is the White House trying to distance themselves from <ent type = 'person'>Hopkin</ent>s &amp; 
<ent type = 'person'>Sutter</ent>?</p>

<p>Funny thing: RTC's office is actually *inside* <ent type = 'person'>Hopkin</ent>'s &amp; 
<ent type = 'person'>Sutter</ent>'s "posh digs" in Chicago!</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Hopkin</ent>'s partner, <ent type = 'person'>Jay Steinberg</ent>, as bankruptcy trustee also 
reportedly swept away what happened to about a billion dollars in 
a group of companies run by a young con man, <ent type = 'person'>William Stecker</ent>(?), 
[unclear] corporation and others.</p>

<p>The [unclear] swindles and the "Andrew Cetti Affair" both 
implicate super FBI agent Mike "Chucky" Peters -- according to 
undisputed federal court records here, implicated in the murder 
of some 41 federal grand jury witnesses.</p>

<p><ent type = 'person'>Hopkin</ent>s &amp; <ent type = 'person'>Sutter</ent> was hired by the federal deposit insurance to 
investigate, supposedly, the offices, directors and lawyers of 
Silverado Savings &amp; Loan of Denver -- a group that included 
George Bush's son, Neil. <ent type = 'person'>Hopkin</ent>'s clout stems from keeping Neil 
Bush from going to prison and also hushing up all mention that 
the CIA plundered Silverado in the course of using that S&amp;L for 
financing covert operations in the United States and overseas.</p>
