    THE DAY JOHN KENNEDY DIED    
  Sun cleared dawn's drizzle, but gloom clouded Dallas   
    by Bryan Woolley   
    Staff Writer   
       
   The valet walked past the Secret Service guard and entered  
Suite 850 of Fort Worth's Texas Hotel. He knocked on the door of 
the master bedroom. It was 7:30 a.m. "Mr. President," he said,   
"it's raining out."      
       
   President <ent type = 'person'>John</ent> F. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent>, coming out of sleep, replied,  
"That's too bad."      
       
   While he was dressing, he heard the murmur of the crowd 
outside and went to the window. Below him, 5,000 people were 
standing patiently in the soft drizzle, some wearing raincoats,  
some holding umbrellas, most simply ignoring the weather. They   
were office and factory workers. They had begun gathering before 
dawn to hear the speech the President would make in the parking  
lot where they stood. Mounted police officers wearing yellow 
slickers moved among them. "Gosh, look at the crowd!" the  
President said to his wife. "Just look! Isn't that terrific."  
       
   In the lobby, he was joined by Vice President <ent type = 'person'>Lyndon</ent>  
<ent type = 'person'>John</ent>son, Gov. <ent type = 'person'><ent type = 'person'>John</ent> <ent type = 'person'>Connally</ent></ent>, Sen. Ralph <ent type = 'person'>Yarborough</ent>, several  
members of Congress and the president of the Fort Worth Chamber  
of Commerce. They crossed Eighth Street and plunged into the 
crowd, shaking hands, smiling. They mounted the truck that was to  
serve as the speaker's platform. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> grabbed the microphone  
and shouted: "There are no faint hearts in Fort Worth!"    
       
   The crowd cheered. Somebody yelled, "Where's Jackie?"   
       
   <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> pointed toward his eighth-floor window. "Mrs.   
<ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> is organizing herself," he replied. "It takes her a  
little longer, but, of course, she looks better than we do when  
she does it."      
       
   Fort Worth was the third stop on the President's five-city  
Texas tour. He had ridden through Houston and San Antonio like a 
triumphant emperor, and Fort Worth had stayed up past midnight to  
welcome the handsome 46-year-old President and his beautiful 
34-year-old wife, lining their route from Carswell Air Force base  
to the hotel.      
       
   After an informal speech in the parking lot, he would go to 
the hotel, deliver a breakfast speech, fly from Carswell to Love 
Field, ride in a motorcade through Dallas, deliver a speech at a 
$100-a-plate luncheon at the Dallas Trade Mart, fly to Austin for  
a banquet and a reception at the Governor's Mansion, and then go 
to the LBJ ranch for a weekend of rest.    
       
   Back inside the Texas Hotel, <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> accepted the ceremonial  
cowboy hat from his hosts, but refused to wear it for  
photographers and TV cameramen. He would model it later, he said,  
at the White House. His breakfast speech was the standard  
fence-mending one-- about the greatness of Texas and Fort Worth  
and the Democratic Party--and it drew a thunderous ovation.  
       
   The President and the first lady retired to Suite 850 to  
prepare for the flight to Dallas. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> placed a call to former  
Vice President <ent type = 'person'>John</ent> Nance "Cactus Jack" Garner in Uvalde, Texas, 
to wish him a happy 95th birthday, and an aide showed him a  
black-bordered full-page ad with a sardonic headline in The  
Dallas Morning News. "Welcome Mr. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> to Dallas," it read. In  
13 rhetorical questions, something called the "American    
Fact-Finding Committee" accused the administration of selling out  
the world to communism.      
       
   "Oh, you know, we're heading into nut country today," the   
President said. Mrs. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> later told author <ent type = 'person'>William Manchester</ent>  
that he paced the floor and then stopped in front of her. "You   
know, last night would have been a hell of a night to assassinate  
a president," he said. "There was the rain and the night, and we 
were all getting jostled. Suppose a man had a pistol in a  
briefcase." He pointed a finger at the wall and pretended to fire  
two shots.       
       
   Not many in the presidential party were looking forward to  
Dallas. Several Texans--some from Dallas--had warned the   
President not to include Dallas on his Texas tour, that an ugly  
incident was likely to occur there. But <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> insisted that the  
state's second-largest city be placed on the itinerary.    
       
   So the preparations had been made. Dallas civic leaders had 
launched a public relations campaign to try to ensure a friendly 
turnout for the President.     
       
   Seven hundred law officers--city police officers and  
firefighters, sheriff's deputies, Texas Rangers and state highway  
patrol officers--had been assembled to keep order. About the time  
that <ent type = 'person'><ent type = 'person'>John</ent> <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent></ent> was waking up, Dallas Police Chief <ent type = 'person'>Jesse <ent type = 'person'>Curry</ent></ent> 
had gone on TV to warn that his officers would take "immediate   
action to block any improper conduct." If the police were  
inadequate, he said, even citizen's arrests were authorized. 
       
   Others were preparing, too, in the early morning. Waiters   
were setting the places for the Trade Mart luncheon. A warehouse 
worker named <ent type = 'person'>Lee Harvey <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent></ent> sneaked a rifle and a telescopic  
sight into the Texas School Book Depository. Because of forecasts  
showing that the rain probably would be past Dallas by the time  
the presidential party arrived, a <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> aide told the Secret   
Service not to put the bubble-top on the big blue limousine in   
which the President and Mrs. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> would ride.   
       
   Air Force One had barely left the runway at Carswell before 
it began its descent toward Love Field. The flight took only 13  
minutes. The big plane touched down at 11:38 a.m. Police armed   
with rifles stood along the roof of the terminal building. A 
large crowd waited be<ent type = 'person'>yon</ent>d a chain-link fence. Many in the crowd  
were jumping, screaming, waving placards: "We Love Jack," "Hooray  
for <ent type = 'person'>JFK</ent>." Others were less friendly. They held placards, too:  
"Help <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> Stamp Out Democracy," "In 1964 <ent type = 'person'>Goldwater</ent> and   
Freedom," "Yankees Go Home And Take Your Equals With You." They  
booed and hissed when the President and first lady emerged from  
the plane, smiled, waved and descended the stairs of Air Force   
One.       
       
   For the fourth time in 24 hours, <ent type = 'person'>Lyndon</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Lady Bird</ent>   
<ent type = 'person'>John</ent>son were waiting to welcome the <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent>s to a Texas city. The  
presidential couple was introduced to the 12-man official  
welcoming committee. Mrs. <ent type = 'person'>Earle Cabell</ent>, wife of the Dallas mayor,  
presented Mrs. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> with a bouquet of red roses. Then <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> 
broke from the official cluster and moved along the chain-link   
fence, smiling, shaking hands; letting people touch him.   
       
   At 11:55, two motorcycle police officers led the motorcade  
out of Love Field and turned left on <ent type = 'person'>Mockingbird</ent> Lane. Police  
Chief <ent type = 'person'>Curry</ent> drove the lead car. With him rode Dallas County  
Sheriff <ent type = 'person'>Bill Decker</ent> and two Secret Service agents. Then came 
three more motorcycles. Then the blue limousine with two Secret  
Service agents in the front, <ent type = 'person'>John</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Nellie <ent type = 'person'>Connally</ent></ent> in the jump  
seats and the <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent>s in the back seat. Two motorcycles flanked 
the car on each side. Next was another convertible, full of  
<ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> aides and Secret Service agents, and four more agents  
standing on its running boards.    
       
   Then came the vice presidential convertible, carrying two   
Secret Service agents, the <ent type = 'person'>John</ent>sons and <ent type = 'person'>Yarborough</ent>. A Texas  
highway patrol officer and four Secret Service agents rode in the  
next car. A press pool car, a press bus, convertibles bearing  
photographers, and cars carrying lesser dignitaries completed the  
procession.      
       
   The motorcade would move through a sizable portion of   
Dallas--along <ent type = 'person'>Mockingbird</ent> to <ent type = 'person'>Lemmon</ent> Avenue, right on <ent type = 'person'>Lemmon</ent> to   
Turtle Creek Boulevard, along Turtle Creek and Cedar Springs Road  
to <ent type = 'person'>Harwood</ent> Street, down <ent type = 'person'>Harwood</ent> to Main Street, where, at City   
Hall, it would turn right and move westward along Main through   
the downtown business district.    
       
   At the west end of downtown, it would turn right onto   
Houston Street and then immediately left onto Elm Street and move  
through the Triple Underpass. A few yards be<ent type = 'person'>yon</ent>d the underpass,  
it would turn right again onto <ent type = 'person'>Stemmons</ent> Expressway and move to   
the Trade Mart at the intersection of <ent type = 'person'>Stemmons</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Harry Hines</ent>   
Boulevard. After the President's speech, it would proceed out  
<ent type = 'person'>Harry Hines</ent> to <ent type = 'person'>Mockingbird</ent>, turn right, and return to Love Field.  
   The sidewalk crowds were sparse at first. A few people in   
the factories and offices along <ent type = 'person'>Mockingbird</ent> came out to have a   
look. The sun was bright now, and Mrs. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> was regretting  
that she was wearing the pink wool suit. She had expected woolen 
weather. It was, after all, late November. She put on sunglasses,  
but her husband told her to take them off. The people wanted to  
see her, he said.      
       
   At the corner of <ent type = 'person'>Lemmon</ent> and Lomo Alto, a group of children  
held a long banner reading, "Please Stop and Shake Our Hands."   
<ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> ordered his driver to stop. He got out and shook their   
hands. Farther along, he ordered another stop and got out to 
greet a group of nuns. At Lee Park on Turtle Creek, the crowd  
began to thicken. And at <ent type = 'person'>Harwood</ent> and Live Oak, still two blocks  
from the turn onto Main, the people in the motorcade heard the   
downtown crowd murmuring like a distant tide.    
       
   When the caravan made the turn, it faced pandemonium. People  
were standing 10 and 12 deep on the sidewalks. Red, white and  
blue bunting fluttered from the buildings. People leaned out 
windows, waving and screaming. There were no picket signs, no  
sour faces. The feared Dallas crowd was friendly--even adoring.  
The nuts had stayed home. It was 12:21 p.m.    
       
   At the Trade Mart, the luncheon guests were showing their   
tickets to the door guards and filing to their seats. The huge   
building was surrounded by Dallas and Texas police, standing at  
parade rest, holding riot sticks, glaring at a handful of  
protesters. Inside the atrium hall, parakeets flew freely from   
tree to tree. A fountain splashed. An organist was practicing  
"Hail to the Chief." Dozens of yellow roses adorned the head 
table. The presidential seal had been mounted on the rostrum.  
       
   As the motorcade neared Houston Street, the size of the 
crowd diminished, but the cheers and applause were still hearty. 
<ent type = 'person'>Nellie <ent type = 'person'>Connally</ent></ent> turned in her seat and said, "You can't say  
Dallas doesn't love you, Mr. President."   
       
   <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> replied, "No, you can't."   
       
   Workers from the Texas School Book Depository, the Dal-Tex  
Building and the Dallas County buildings lined the sidewalks at  
Houston and Elm as the head of the motorcade turned toward the   
Triple Underpass. Others stood on the grass of Dealey Plaza. Many  
had brought their children to see the President. Several   
spectators noticed a man standing very still in a sixth-floor  
corner window of the depository. One man saw the rifle he was  
holding and assumed he was a Secret Service agent.   
       
   As the blue limousine made the sharp left turn from Houston 
onto Elm, the Hertz rental car time-and-temperature sign on the  
roof of the depository red 12:30. A Secret Service man in the  
motorcade radioed the Trade Mart: "Halfback to Base. Five minutes  
to destination." He wrote in his shift log: "12:35 p.m. President  
<ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> arrived at Trade Mart."    
       
   Some thought the noises were firecrackers. Others thought a 
motorcycle was backfiring. Some recognized them as rifle shots.  
Pigeons flew from the roof of the depository. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> lurched  
forward and grabbed his neck.    
       
   Sen. <ent type = 'person'>Yarborough</ent>, in the vice president's car, cried, "My  
God! They've shot the President!" Secret Service agent Rufus 
Youngblood climbed from the front seat to the back, threw <ent type = 'person'>John</ent>son  
to the floorboard and covered him with his own body.   
       
   In the blue limousine, Gov. <ent type = 'person'>Connally</ent> had been hit, too. He  
pitched forward and fell toward his wife. "No, no, no, no, no!"  
he screamed.       
       
   Then another shot. The President's head exploded. Blood 
spattered the occupants of the blue car. The first lady, in  
shock, tried to climb out over the trunk. A Secret Service agent 
pushed her back. The car slowed and then lurched out of the  
motorcade line and sped past the Triple Underpass, with Chief  
<ent type = 'person'>Curry</ent>'s car and the Secret Service car in pursuit.   
       
   UPI White House correspondent <ent type = 'person'>Merriman Smith</ent> was sitting in 
the middle of the front seat of the press pool car. He grabbed   
the mobile phone. He called the wire service's Dallas bureau and 
dictated the first bulletin: "Three shots were fired at President  
<ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent>'s motorcade in downtown Dallas."   
       
   The cheers of greeting in Dealey Plaza rose to screams of   
horror and fear. "They killed him! They killed him! They killed  
him!" Parents grabbed children and ran. Men and women lay  
prostrate on the grass and sidewalks, as if dead. The motorcade  
was disintegrating, the cars veering hither and <ent type = 'person'>yon</ent>, trying to   
get through the crowd and follow the limousine. Helmeted police  
officers leaped from motorcycles, pulled guns, looked wildly 
about. The Hertz clock still read 12:30.   
       
   The staff at <ent type = 'person'>Parkland</ent> Memorial Hospital had only five   
minutes notice of the massive emergency rushing upon them, and   
many thought the message was a joke. When the blue car arrived,  
they weren't ready. No one was waiting at the emergency entrance.  
A Secret Service agent dashed inside to order stretchers.  
       
   <ent type = 'person'>Connally</ent>--whose wounds were serious but not fatal--was  
wheeled to Trauma Room No. 2, <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> to Trauma Room No. 1. Teams  
of surgeons and nurses went to work. The Secret Service regrouped  
around the <ent type = 'person'>John</ent>sons and hustled them to seclusion in another part  
of the hospital. Reporters dashed around the halls and offices,  
searching for phones. <ent type = 'person'>Parkland</ent> patients heard the news and rushed  
to have a look.      
       
   "Gentlemen," a weeping <ent type = 'person'>Yarborough</ent> told reporters, "this has 
been a deed of horror. Excalibur has sunk beneath the waves."  
Mrs. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> insisted on being in the trauma room with her   
husband. A nurse protested, but she was admitted.    
       
   Outside, more of the motorcade vehicles were arriving. Their  
passengers tumbled out and stared in horror at the blood-soaked  
convertible.       
       
   At 1 p.m., Dr. <ent type = 'person'>Kemp Clark</ent>, the senior physician working on  
the President, pronounced him dead. A priest administered last   
rites. At 1:13, the news was carried to the vice president. At   
1:26, the Secret Service, fearing the assassination was part of a  
massive plot against the government, spirited the <ent type = 'person'>John</ent>sons away  
to unmarked cars and sped to Love Field. They boarded Air Force  
One at 1:33, while <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> press aide <ent type = 'person'>Malcolm Kilduff</ent> was  
announcing the President's death to the press.   
       
   Police were still combing the Dealey Plaza area for   
<ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent>'s murderer. Indeed, only a minute after the fatal shot   
was fired, <ent type = 'person'>Marrion <ent type = 'person'>Baker</ent></ent>, a Dallas motorcycle officer, had   
pointed his pistol at <ent type = 'person'>Lee Harvey <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent></ent>. <ent type = 'person'>Baker</ent> had been riding by  
the Texas School Book Depository when the killing occurred, and  
he jumped off his motorcycle and dashed inside with <ent type = 'person'>Roy Truly</ent>,   
the building's superintendent. They encountered <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent> in the  
second-floor lunchroom. <ent type = 'person'>Baker</ent> drew his gun. "Do you know this  
man?" he asked Truly. "Does he work here?" Truly said he did, and  
<ent type = 'person'>Baker</ent> let him go. A minute later, <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent> walked out the front  
door of the depository, where he encountered NBC reporter Robert 
MacNeil, who was looking for a phone. <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent> told him he could   
find one inside. Five minutes later, police sealed off the door. 
       
   At 12:44, <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent> boarded a bus at Elm and <ent type = 'person'>Murphy</ent> streets,   
seven blocks from the depository, but got off a few minutes later  
when the bus was caught in a traffic snarl. By 12:45, Dallas 
police had questioned the witness who had seen the man standing  
in the depository window with the rifle and had broadcast his  
description from a radio car in front of the depository. Two 
minutes later, <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent> caught a taxicab at the Greyhound bus  
station and rode to <ent type = 'person'>Beckley</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>Neely</ent>, a corner near his Oak 
Cliff rooming house. He went to his room, got a pistol and left  
again.       
       
   Meanwhile, <ent type = 'person'>Roy Truly</ent> had drawn up a list of depository  
employees and told police that <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent> was missing. At 1:12,  
sheriff's deputies found three empty cartridge cases near the  
sixth floor corner window. Ten minutes later, they would find the  
rifle, hidden between boxes of textbooks in the room.  
       
   At 1:15, Dallas officer J.D. <ent type = 'person'>Tippett</ent> was cruising by a drug 
store at 10th and <ent type = 'person'>Patton</ent>, less than a mile from the Oak Cliff  
rooming house, and spotted <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent> walking along the sidewalk.  
<ent type = 'person'>Tippett</ent>, for reasons never determined, pulled over and stopped   
him. <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent> jerked his pistol from under his jacket, shot four   
times and ran away. Nine people saw the shooting. A pickup truck 
driver took the dead officer'<ent type = 'person'>s radio</ent> <ent type = 'person'>mike</ent> and said, "Hello,  
police operator. We've had a shooting out here."   
       
   On Air Force One, stewards were removing some of the seats  
in the tail compartment to make room for President <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent>'s 
coffin. In the plane's stateroom, <ent type = 'person'><ent type = 'person'>Lyndon</ent> <ent type = 'person'>John</ent>son</ent> was watching  
<ent type = 'person'>Walter Cronkite</ent> on television and was asking aides and   
congressmen whether he should be sworn in immediately or wait  
until they had returned to Washington. Some thought he should  
wait. Others thought it might be dangerous for the country to be 
without a President while he was en route. <ent type = 'person'>John</ent>son decided he  
would assume the office in Dallas. "Now," he said, "What about   
the oath?"       
       
   The aides and congressmen were embarrassed. They could  
remember neither the words nor where to find them. They couldn't 
remember who, besides Supreme Court justices, was authorized to  
administer the oath. Ever<ent type = 'person'>yon</ent>e was in such shock and confusion  
that phone calls were made to several Justice Department   
officials in Washington and Dallas before someone remembered that  
a President may be sworn in by any judge and that the oath is in 
the Constitution. Deputy Attorney General <ent type = 'person'>Nicholas Katzenbach</ent>  
dictated it by phone from Washington, and U.S. District Judge  
<ent type = 'person'>Sarah <ent type = 'person'>Hughes</ent></ent>, an old friend of <ent type = 'person'>John</ent>son who had been appointed to 
the North Texas federal bench by <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent>, was dispatched to Love 
Field.       
       
   At 1:40, Lee <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent> ran into the Texas Theater on West  
Jefferson--eight blocks from officer <ent type = 'person'>Tippit</ent>'s body--without  
buying a ticket. The box office attendant called the police. 
Cruisers began converging on the theater. At 1:50, the house 
lights went up, and officers moved up and down the aisles, looked  
into the faces of the few patrons. Officer M.N. McDonald stopped 
at the 10th row and said to a man sitting alone: "Get up."   
       
   "Well, it's all over now," <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent> said, according to  
witnesses and he stood up. But when McDonald moved closer, <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent>  
struck him in the face and went for his pistol. McDonald struck  
back and grabbed for the gun. <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent> pulled the trigger, but the 
web of skin between McDonald's thumb and forefinger was caught   
under the hammer. The gun didn't fire. Other officers joined the 
fight. They subdued <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent> and hustled him out of the theater. "I  
protest this police brutality!" <ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent> shouted.    
       
   Twenty-five minutes later, Capt. Will <ent type = 'person'>Fritz</ent>, chief of   
homicide, returned to the Police Department and ordered that the 
missing Texas School Book Depository worker named Lee Harvey 
<ent type = 'person'>Oswald</ent> be arrested as a suspect in the presidential killing. An  
officer pointed to a small young man with a bruised eye who was  
sitting in a chair. "There he sits," he said.    
       
   At <ent type = 'person'>Parkland</ent>, a Secret Service agent called Oneal's Funeral  
Home in Oak Lawn to order a casket. The funeral director, Vernon 
Oneal, arrived with it at 1:30. After the President's body had   
been placed in the casket, Mrs. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> entered Trauma Room No.  
1, took off her wedding ring and placed it on her husband's  
finger. The casket was closed and placed on a funeral home cart  
to be moved to the hearse.     
       
   Dr. <ent type = 'person'>Earl Rose</ent>, the Dallas County medical examiner,    
protested. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> was a homicide victim, he said, and the body  
couldn't be released legally until after an autopsy had been 
performed. A quarrel developed between him and the Secret  
Service. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> aides and the Secret Service agents forced the  
casket through the crowd that had gathered at the hospital door  
and loaded it into the hearse. Mrs. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> rode in the back with  
it. At 2:20, the dead President was carried up the stairs into   
Air Force One. Mrs. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> retired to the bedroom.    
       
   Judge <ent type = 'person'>Hughes</ent> boarded the plane at 2:35 and was handed a 
small white card with the oath scrawled on it. Capt. Cecil   
Stoughton, an Army Signal Corps photographer, tried to arrange   
the crowd in the cramped stateroom so that he could take a   
picture of the ceremony. "We'll wait for Mrs. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent>," <ent type = 'person'>John</ent>son  
said. "I want her here."     
       
   Mrs. <ent type = 'person'>Kennedy</ent> came out of the bedroom still wearing the  
blood-soaked pink suit. <ent type = 'person'>John</ent>son pressed her hand and said, "This 
is the saddest moment of my life." The photographer placed her on  
<ent type = 'person'>John</ent>son's left, <ent type = 'person'>Lady Bird</ent> on his right. Judge <ent type = 'person'>Hughes</ent>, the first
