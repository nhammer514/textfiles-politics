<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   THE CHURCH CROWNS THE PAPAL POLICY</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   At the close of the book on the monstrous <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erfidy of the Black
International in Czecho-Slovakia I asked: What did Pius XII, the
new <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>, and his local hierarchies do when the hellish bugles
sounded and the black flag was unfurled?</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   In our day-to-day reading of the crowded events of our time,
under the changing strain of feelings which one day are warmed with
stories of heroism and next day are chilled with des<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>air, we
naturally lose sight of whatever continuity there is in the
bewildering <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rocession. We could not readily answer such questions
as this, although it refers to only two years ago. But I have
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ared the reader for the answer. The Black International has
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ursued a consistent <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy during the last ten years, to say
nothing of earlier times. It has fawned u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on the three <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Powers</ent> which
had already by 1930 o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>enly exhibited such shameless <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rograms of
greed and barbaric violence that the war was inevitable. I have </<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roved that. So the answer to our question also is inevitable. The
Black International clung still to the arch-enemies of the human
race through all their crimes and atrocities as long as they had a
confident <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rosPect of victory.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Will it change its <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy when that <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ros<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ect changes to one of
defeat and dire <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>unishment? I write with the hum of war-<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lanes
overhead, the slender fingers of the searchlights <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>robing for the
enemy that would make a shuddering <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ul<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> of us. Round me are the
horrid ga<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s in the rows of little <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eaceful homes from which I have
seen the men -- the garbage-men of a "New Order" -- bring out the
shrouded, crum<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>led forms of the dead. In the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress daily are the
rumble of a struggle in Russia that sur<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>asses everything in the
calendar of human folly and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erversity and the tremulous
foreshadowing of an agony that the winter may bring u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on
200,000,000 broken-hearted folk. The end is not in sight, and I
have no gift of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hecy. But should, as I confidently ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ect, the
heroism of the Russian <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le hurl back the advancing wave of
savagery and give us an unwavering ho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e of victory the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>acy will
change its <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Remember the last war. The Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>acy su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orted Germany, which had
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>romised it the usual reward -- more <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower and wealth to the Church
-- even against Italy, but as soon as America entered the arena and
the defeat of Germany seemed <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>robable, it recollected that the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>
is the Great Neutral. The signs of change already flicker in the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress, but notice how feeble, how anonymous, how easily re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>udiated
they are as long as the terrific might of Germany still rears its
brutal head! Whatever be the next or the final <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hase, let the world
never forget how the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>acy hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed its deadly and unscru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulous
enemies during the long years of corru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aration and su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orted
them during two years of shuddering criminality. The one virtue
which its best a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologists claim for it that it <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>reached the virtues
of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace, did but hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> to do<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e the innocent nations while the
crooks armed themselves. At least from 1936 onward war was
inevitable because Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an, Germany, and Italy could attain the
objects to which they were o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>enly <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ledged by no other means, and
they saw the rest of the world so beguiled with their <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>i<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e-dream of
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace that it seemed to them safe to o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>en the insidious cam<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aign.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   And in case the reader has become to some extent confused by
the mass of details and testimonies which it has been necessary to
give in su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ort of this indictment let us sum u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> and formulate very
clearly the charges against the Black International. The intimate
connection of the Vatican by solemn agreements and the exchange of
ambassadors with Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an, Italy, and Germany and with such satellites
of theirs as Franco S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain, Vichy, Portugal, Hungary, etc., is a
fact of ordinary record. A des<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erate a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologist might say that this
has no more significance than the di<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lomatic relations of other
neutral <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>owers with those countries. The Catholic a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologist is so
accustomed to writing for his own <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le, who are forbidden under
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain of hell to read criticisms of what he says, and treated with
such generosity in the general <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress that there is no limit to his
audacity. Listen to this. On the very day on which I write this I
receive a letter from a corres<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ondent who tells me that a Catholic
to whom he s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oke of the infamous agreement of <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> and the
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> in 1929 denies that there ever was such a com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>act and that it </<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>is just one of McCabe's lies! Can you beat that? The Concordat and
Treaty were editorially discussed in every <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>er in the world,
es<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecially the Catholic <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ers, which hailed the agreement as a
su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erb trium<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>h of Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al di<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lomacy, and it seems im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ossible that a
Catholic should not know that the Vatican City and all its
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivileges (inde<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>endence, radio, etc.) only began with and were
founded by that treaty.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   There is one fundamental difference between the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition of
secular <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>owers that exchange ambassadors and courtesies with the
Vatican and that of the Vatican itself: to say nothing of the fact
that these <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>owers make no <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>retence of moral res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>onsibility and
s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>iritual guidance of the world. They have not in Germany or Italy
a black army of 50,000 to 100,000 servants under their control --
bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests, monks, nuns, religious brothers, organizers,
teachers, journalists, etc. -- which <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofesses that it has to build
the character of the nation. The Vatican has. It is one of the
loudest boasts of the Church of Rome over its rivals that it is
international, its various national branches being entirely subject
to the Vatican, and that this gives it a unique <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower to judge
events from the universal moral, not the narrow national view<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   What, then, are the vices of this triumvirate of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oisoning
nations which the Vatican ought, on its own <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofession, to have
denounced to the world instead of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotecting them by friendly
alliance? It will be enough here to select three.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The first is that the war for which they are res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>onsible is
the most bestial in modern history because it is a war of naked
greed. Shires tells us in his Berlin Diary that he once said this,
in less blunt language, to the Nazi Economic Minister <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Funk</ent>, and the
man admitted that the aim of it was to secure "the maximum economic
o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortunity" for Germany. Notoriously its aim is to concentrate
industrial <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roduction in Germany or to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ermit it in subject
countries, which are to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovide food and raw material -- a much
less <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofitable service -- only under German control. Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an won
over the mass of its workers to the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lans of its militarists and
ca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>italists by just the same bait. Even the leaders of the Social
Mass (Socialist) Party su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ort the Chinese Incident. They say that
the British workers have a good status because the country seized
vast colonies overseas and ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loits them. I should like to hear
them tell an Australian, Canadian, or South African that his
country is a "colony" and is ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loited by Great Britain. In Italy
the original idea was the same. The chief argument of the
government during the Abyssinian War was that the country contained
at vast amount of undevelo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed wealth which would raise the income
of every class in Italy. Today, it is true, they com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lain that the
word Axis is heard no longer, and that their German overlords
brutally tell them that the destiny of Italy is to be a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>layground
and kitchen-garden for Germans. But a share in the vast s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oils of
the war was the lure that brought them into it.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It is a much-dis<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>uted <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint whether all modern wars can be
brought under an economic formula. In the case of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resent war
there is no dis<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ute. <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> and <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> may have medieval dreams
of conquest and em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ire, and the Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anese fanatics may talk about </<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>the divine mission of the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Yamata</ent> race to u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lift the world, but the
real motive is that the division of the earth into two s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>heres of
influence means incalculable wealth for Germany and Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an and huge
fortunes for their <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oliticians, bankers, and industrialists.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   That is the war the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed to bring on. It <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>romised more
wealth and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower to the Church. It meant the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aralysis of
industrial develo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ment and its consequences -- education, urban
life, free discussion and the growth of Socialism and ske<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ticism --
in the countries in which the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>acy had lost most heavily. Notice
what is ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ening in France. Petain makes no secret of his design
to destroy the old industrial life in the interest of the Church.
Even if you think a bunch of Italian clerics hardly ca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>able of a
world-<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lot so subtle as this you have their cry, re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eated for years
throughout the Church, for the destruction of Bolshevism and
Liberalism, the most <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rolific sources of rebellion against the
Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>acy. Whichever way you take it the Black International has, for
its own <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofit, lent its aid in <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aring the conditions of success
of the most sordid war of greed in modern history and has in each
country, through the local Church, boisterously su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orted every
ste<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> that Was taken in the direction of world-domination.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The second general vice is that the ambition of these <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Powers</ent>
has led to a quite re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulsive degradation of the standards of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublic
conduct. Here there is no <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ossibility of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>leading ignorance on the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art of the sim<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le-minded Vatican. The Nazis have lied to and du<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed
the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>acy itself re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eatedly since their first bargain with it in
1933, and four-fifths of its com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>laints about Germany and Italy are
grumbles that the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Concordats</ent> which were solemnly signed have not
been observed. Even Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an is now beginning to give it serious
concern by its scheme to make Christianity <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>urely national and
inde<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>endent of foreign influence.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Broadly we have seen years of such lying, treachery, and
corru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tion as we thought that we had buried forever. Nearly a
hundred <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>acts, treaties, or international agreements of one kind or
other have been signed in the last 20 years and cynically disowned
as soon as it was ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>edient. An Australian <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>er, The Vigilant,
sends me a co<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>y of an issue in which it quotes <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>'s solemn
assurance of non-aggression to every country he has attacked or
annexed. "Germany neither intends nor wishes", he says in 1935, "to
interfere in the international affairs of Austria, to annex
Austria, or to conclude an Anschluss." His books show that he
wished and intended it long before that time. "The Sudetenland is
the last territorial claim I have to make in Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e," he said on
Se<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tember 26, 1938. Within a few month's he took the whole of
Czecho-Slovakia and began to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>are for Poland. "Germany has
concluded a non-aggression <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>act with Poland and she will adhere to
it unconditionally", he had told Poland and Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e. So with
Holland, Belgium, and Yugo-Slavia. And all Germany Heil <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>ed
when on June 22, 1941, he said, with his usual ferocious solemnity:
"When the German <ent type = 'person'>Reich</ent> gives a guarantee, that means that it also
abides by it."</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It is not only that the leading statesmen of the aggressor
nations have lied so brazenly and cynically for years that the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roblem of the future historian will not be their <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>sychology but </<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>that of the democratic statesmen. No trick has been too dirty to
use. The corru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tor, or advance-agent, was considered as res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ectable
as the missionary. Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anese young "ladies" <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rostituted themselves
in the good cause in China and Mongolia, and in France dames of the
highest elegance used their charms for Germany and the Church.
Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anese and German gold corru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ted even Russians. Buddhist monks
were used in Southern Asia, and women and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>romises of advancement
everywhere to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovide the miserable brood of traitors, almost a
novelty of our age, whom we call Quislings. In short, the near-
success of the trinity in crime was won by as vast and
com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rehensive a debasement of our standards of honor as had not
been known in Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e since those flowers of the Age of Faith -- the
Age of Chivalry and the Renaissance.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Now not even <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>a Bernard Shaw</ent> or <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>an Aldous Huxley</ent> will say that
this foulness, this reversion to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re-civilized ways of living, is
found on all sides. Paradox is amusing but a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aradox of that sort
would be revolting. Certainly we all have our faults. I write for
men and women who discount the utterances of statesmen and bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s
and do not see the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resent struggle as a Miltonian conflict of
angels and devils. We are <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oor enough, heaven knows, and much of
the motivation of our conduct even in this war is far from angelic.
But that this corru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tion of the standards of conduct is
overwhelmingly on one side will be generally recognized. It is on
the side of the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s allies; and it has done incalculable harm to
the democracies, for whom he has not a good word.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   And the third vice, closely connected with this, is the
bestiality with which the friends of the Vatican have conducted the
cam<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aign to attain their bestial greeds. A war ins<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ired by such a
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ur<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ose could not very well be otherwise. It is on the gangster
level. Fear of retaliation has restrained that use of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oison-gas
which we ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ected but the horrors thicken as I write. We thought
that we had reached a stage when soldier's recognized the rights of
man and confined their killing within certain lines. Now some blond
beast in Paris or Prague, to get <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>raise or higher <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofit from his
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Fuhrer</ent>, shoots fifty entirely innocent men for the act of an
unknown. Bulgar officers bloodily exterminate whole villages.
Russian villagers are shut in their houses and burned alive. The
food of children is stolen in Denmark and Holland. Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anese
officers indulge themselves or their men in ra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e and force o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ium
u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on the Chinese. Gesta<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o men, trained in <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> Colleges to give
the rein to sadistic im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulses . . . But you have read enough about
these things.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   What does the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> say about this conduct of his allies?
Nothing. It would be "interference in <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olities" to notice what the
Italians did in Abyssinia or are doing in Greece and Yugo-Slavia,

broadcast address and lamented that he heard of "infamy of all

imagined that the Russians had taken over some ten million Pole's
and were beating the life out of them, whereas, as the rest of us
know, the Russians had taken back only White Russians and
Ukrainians and were only too eager to make them feel at home in the
Soviet Union. In any case, although the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress was still acridly
anti-Russian no res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>onsible <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>er even suggested that they were
committing outrages.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   A little earlier a censure of the seizure of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art of Finland
by Russia had shown that the eagle eye of the Vatican ranged even
over the frozen north in search of outrages to rebuke -- if they
were not committed by its allies. There were many of us who did not
at that time know what Russia had offered for the territory and how
vitally necessary it was in view of the coming war, but we knew
that Russians did not behave like the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s friends. The Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al
organ, however, the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'><ent type = 'person'>Osservatore</ent> Romano</ent>, sur<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assed itself --
es<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecially as it had never condemned outrages before. It had such
lyrical <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assages as:</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   "After twenty years of Bolshevik tyranny it now a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ears that
Communism which had already su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ressed <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olitical liberty, stilled
individuality, reduced work to the status of slavery, and erected
violence into, a system, has added a new <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>earl to its diadem . . ."
After hounding men it now hounds nations.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>acy com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>laining that some other institution stifles
individuality is rich, and one cannot hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> reflecting today that
for slaves the Russian workers fight with remarkable s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>irit. But
these are incidental trifles such as we <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ick u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> in all Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ronouncements. The broad comment on this Vatican rebuke of
aggression is this: by that time Germany had drenched the Jews with
horrors, carried out its infamous Blood Purge, and savagely
destroyed Czecho-Slovakia. Italy had <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>er<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>etrated the grossest
outrages in Abyssinia and Albania, and Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an had overrun five
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovince's of China and treated tens of millions of the Chinese
with barbarity. The Vatican, which had re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resentatives of the three
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Powers</ent> in the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al Court, had seen none of this wanton and
monstrous aggressiveness and its accom<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anying savagery. Just as
today it knows nothing about the savagery that is being <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>er<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>etrated
on Serbs, Greeks, and other conquered <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>les. But the moment
Russia enters u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on a normal military o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eration -- not after a
treacherous <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>act of friendshi<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>, but after an earnest effort to
bargain for what it vitally needed -- the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> ceases to be the
Great Neutral and discovers that he is the su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>reme judge of the
moral life of the world.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The Russians committed no outrages in either Finland or the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovinces they recovered from Poland, although Poland had, as I
will show <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resently, shamefully <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecuted those <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovinces for
twenty years. Today the Germans are in Russia and are sur<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assing

Russia, so when he says that he has, officially, full and solid

cannot maintain his customary moral survey of the world. Bunk. Not
even the banks and exchanges are watching the ebb and flow of the
red tide in Russia and calculating the chances of the issue more
carefully than the Vatican. He will not utter a word of censure
until we know that Germany is beaten. The common decent German
soldier is sickened by the infamies committed by the Nazi-trained
troo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olice under Nazi leaders. A letter to his wife that was
found on the body of one ran:</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

what goes, on in our army in Russia. Vice, loot, violence, murder,

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Evidence accumulates daily that the Italian <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le and

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   And as far as one can <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>enetrate the august secrets of these
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roceedings it was not so much the Italian as the foreign,
including the British and American cardinals, who turned a wavering
scale in his favor. Pius XI, of unha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>y memory -- no <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> in modern
times had been so severely criticized by Catholic writers of
several countries -- died on February 10, 1940, and the cardinal
voters flew to Rome. The world learned how scru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulous is the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rocedure of the Church, the cardinals are locked in a room where
they slee<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> and eat (and drink) until two-thirds of them agree u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on
a <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   What -- incidentally -- the world did not learn was the rather
amusing meaning of this Conclave (or "'shut in with a key"). The
history of Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al elections for the last sixteen centuries, or since
the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>acy became rich, beats the history of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>residential elections
to a frazzle for bribery, intrigue, and good honest fighting. If
you read French and can get it read <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Petrucelli</ent> della Gattina's
Histoire di<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loinatique des <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Conclaves</ent> (4 vols, 1864-6), though you
will find a good deal of the material in Miss V. Pirie's Tri<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le
Crown (1935). However, in 1271 the cardinals who were assembled for
an election in the Italian <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovincial town of Viterbo so disgusted
the towns folk by wrangling for three years that the civic
authorities locked them in a room and saw that none of them left it
or intrigued with outsiders until they elected a <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>. From that
date <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Conclaves</ent> began, though it must be confessed that the new
institution by no means <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut an end to bribery, intrigue, and
fighting.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   On March 2, <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Pacelli</ent> was elected. Unlike <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofane elections that
of a <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> begins with a very solemn invocation of the Holy Ghost --
it did even in the days when the bribery ran to a million dollars
and the murders to 200 -- and then there are grave deliberations,
and the cardinals visit each other in their cells (the cubicles
into which <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art of the room is divided). After each vote the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ers
are burned and the smoke is conducted out by a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>i<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e so that the
Romans shall see. We thus know that there were three "scrutinies",
or examinations of votes, so that it took a considerable time for
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Pacelli</ent> to get the necessary two-thirds of the votes. In other
words, although he was certainly the ablest candidate, the best
ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ert on international affairs, and the best linguist, more than
half the cardinals were at first o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osed to him. It is useless to
s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eculate on the reasons, but we receive with ske<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ticism the re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ort
that German and Italian cardinals tried to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>revent his election at
the bidding of <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> and <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent>. Had <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Pacelli</ent> as Secretary of
State not done enough for them? The best authority, the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s

day for him.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

to ha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>en when it was seen that other candidates had no chance. In

Abyssinia for his sur<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lus <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulation he was now content; <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>'s
assurance that with his annexation of the German fringe of Czecho-
Slovakia he had reached the limit of his ambition; Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an's
assurance that it did not now covet a single additional square mile
of Chinese or other Asiatic territory.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   But every man who saw the broad truth about the world-
situation, that the race had entered u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on a titanic conflict
between <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivilege -- wealth, Churches, all vested authority -- and
a new s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>irit that was reviled as Bolshevism, and that the utterly
corru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t and dangerous forces of Nazism, Fascism, and Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anese
Im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erialism had been enlisted on the side of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivilege, knew that,
while the world was not yet in flames, a sinister fire shouldered
underground, and it was no time for <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>retty talk about Peace and
Charity. Sluggish as British statesmen were, we now know that they
were <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aring for the conflict that broke out later in the year,
though they <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotested that the risks of disturbing the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace of the
world by overt action (raising vast monition-<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lant's) restricted
them to such matters as secretly hiring <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>remises for ministries in
the country, drafting schemes, and organizing medical and
undertaking services for vast numbers of wounded and dead
civilians.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I must confine myself to these matters in so far as they
involve the Church of Rome. The idea that the new <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> entered a
world of danger and confusion for which others were res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>onsible
brought to it a new and beautiful gos<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>el is, we now understand,
tri<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e. He had had as Secretary of State at least for the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>receding
five years the same <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower which he would now wield as <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>, and he
had deliberately used it to hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> the work of the forces of evil
because, he believed, it was to the interest of the Church. It was
nothing new for him to talk about <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace. As the ins<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>irer of Pius XI
he had <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>raise of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace on his li<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s or in his fountain-<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>en
twice a year for years. In the intervals he had called through the
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s mouth for the extinction of Bolshevism and u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on that cry
only one <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ossible inter<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>retation can be <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut -- war. We saw that
Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy after 1919 was bound to seek this end above all
others. Socialism and Communism were running the Church. And the
only <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ossible ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lanation of the Vatican entering into and in s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ite
of every rebuff clinging to the alliance with the corru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t forces of
Nazism, Fascism, and Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an is that they <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>romised to accom<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lish
that. It was the reason, also, why <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Pacelli</ent>, in the name of Pius XI,
wrote an encyclical enjoining every Catholic state to become a
Fascist Cor<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orative State, and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ractically all the South American
Re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublics as well as Portugal and Hungary, and later S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain, France,
and Belgium com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lied. Coercion alone brought a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ostates to heel.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I made short reference in one booklet to -- as far as I can

-- of the sentiment that had long been forced u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on it: that
Socialism and Communism must be destroyed and that, since argument
about the beauty of the Catholic faith ran off Socialists and
Communists (who knew its history too well) like water off a duck's

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>fundamental let us return to it for a moment. The occasion was a
rece<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tion at the Vatican of S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anish refugees on Se<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tember 14, 1936.
The <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eech to them, which is <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublished in English by the
Catholic Truth Society -- I do not know if by this time they
realized their blunder and su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ressed it -- with the title The
S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anish Terror is no rambling talk of an aged and agitated <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest.
It is a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olished rhetorical address, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ared in the Secretariat of
State. It re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resents the rebellion of Catholic Fascist generals in
S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain as a "satanic" attack on the established order by the very
men who had established it, and it says that this is the work of
"those forces which have already given <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roof and estimate of their
quality in the attem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t to subvert established order of every kind
from Russia to China, from Mexico to South America". As Chiang Kai-
Chek had already, under the treacherous guidance of his earlier
associates in Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an, destroyed Communism in China (and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ared the
way for Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an), the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s allies were destroying it in S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain, and
the Fascist governments of South America had destroyed it there at
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Pacelli</ent>'s request, the meaning is clear. The <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> invited Germany
(with the aid of rugged divisions from Catholic countries) and
Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an to attack Russia and the United States to attack and annex
Mexico. From that date the cry for the extinction of Bolshevism in
Russia and Mexico echoed every month through the Catholic world.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It is <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lain that this sentiment of the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> is not merely
inconsistent with his gos<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>el of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace, but it sha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olicy which
was the very worst <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ossible for the world and for the real <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ros<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ect
of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace at that time. I do not suggest that the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> was either
muddle-headed or hy<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ocritical. He had made his <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition clear a
score of times: <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace -- when Communism was extinct by the conquest
of Russia and Mexico and his Nazi and Fascist allies had received,
as a gift, what the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> thought they wanted. It was the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s
admirers who were muddle-headed or -- when they told the world that
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Pacelli</ent> was going to work for <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace without qualification --
hy<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ocritical.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Recent events have now shown that the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace of the world and
the removal of the corru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tion that threatened civilization de<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ended
above all u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on the democracies and (in some form or other) the
United States allying themselves closely with Russia. I may be
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ardoned for ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>laining that this is not on my own <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art a case of
being wise after the event. In the A. B. C. Library of Living
Knowledge (No. 3, Economic Gains of the Soviet Union, 1937) I fully
vindicated that great civilization against calumnies that were
current in nearly the whole <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress and showed how <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace was the
first condition it required for the com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>letion of its s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lendid
work. I <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ointed out that whatever dreams Russians may have had at
an earlier date of ins<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>iring revolution in other countries had been
long abandoned, and they were content to let the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>les of the
world judge for themselves between the civilizations of the west
and that of the Soviet Union. I warned the reader that it was just
because the Russians were so successful in creating a civilization
without <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rivate ca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ital and without religion that the combined
influence of ca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>italism and the Churches used almost the entire
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress to libel them. "This generation," I said (<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>. 29), "is the

aloofness from Russia, certain to come and said:</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   "If this war of aggression, which, if it were successful,
would be a signal to <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> to take u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> -- at the deadly ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ense

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I have knowledge of even Rationalists who had long read my
books but refused to read another line of mine because of that
little book on Russia. They <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>referred the su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erficial gush and
treacherous o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>timism of acce<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ted writers and journalists who fooled
them about the new Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al era of Peace and Charity.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Since this is the one defence of the action of the Black
International, that the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> used his world-<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>restige to issue one
fervent a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eal after another for <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace, we must make a decisive
re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ly to it. We are concerned with the action of the Church and
will not be diverted by this trick of distinguishing between local
hierarchies, as if they had a remarkable degree of inde<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>endence of
the Vatican, and the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>. We shall see, indeed everybody knows,
that the German Church loudly su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orted <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>, as usual, when he
launched the world-war and all its horrors, the Italian Church
fully su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orted <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> in his miserable entrance into the war as
soon as he felt that victory was certain, and the S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anish, Irish,
Hungarian, and Portuguese Churches -- and when the time came the
Belgian and French Churches -- su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orted their governments in
assisting and fawning on the aggressors.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   But for the moment we must clearly understand the action of
the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> himself. Chanting the virtues of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace is as idle as
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>reaching justice in the abstract and is often far more dangerous.
The only occasion on which I ever addressed a meeting of a Peace
Society was in 1938. I at first declined the invitation and
consented only on the understanding that I would tell them truths
which they would not like. The bulk of the members refused to
attend -- the local Churches had been busy -- and to the few who
did I <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resented a realistic analysis of the state of the world,
which the chief officials described as masterly and worthy of their
dee<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>est consideration, and a solemn warning of what was coming. I
was not further invited to address one of the hundreds of Peace
Societies in Great Britain, and a few months later they were all
enthusiastic over the new <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s beautiful sentiments! These <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le
flatter themselves that they have su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erior sentiments to the rest
of us when they really differ from us in flabbiness of intellect
or, in the better cases, in lack of realism.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lain truth is that the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> talked <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace and worked for
war. He had a very large share in the libel and hatred of Russia
which <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>revented the one combination of sound forces that could
ensure <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace. France had entered into an alliance of mutual defense
with Russia, but the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>enly condemned it, and the Catholic

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>study of world-affairs at that time to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erceive that the only
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ossible danger to the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace of the world lay in Germany, Italy,
and Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an. A closer student, as the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> was su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osed to be, could
go further. He would know that those three <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Powers</ent>, his friends,
were determined to start an aggressive war. What, in such
circumstances, was the value of his a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eals to the world at large
to see the beauty of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace?</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Well, says the a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologist, wearily, at least he soon <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erceived
his error and entered u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on a series of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ractical <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osals for
ensuring <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace. Did he? He was crowned <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> on March 12. I said in
an earlier essay that it detracts somewhat from the beauty of his
words about Charity that on the very day of his coronation the Jews
were, with terrible injustice and suffering, turned out of Italy,
and he said nothing. Again I beg his <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ardon. He <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotected some of
the Jews. In October (1941) the Italian <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>er La Vita Italiana
sourly com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lained that not only were there still Jews in Italy but
some of them were millionaires and occu<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ied very high <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ositions in
the state-service. One of these, a <ent type = 'person'>Signor <ent type = 'person'>Sacerdoti</ent></ent>, had just been
a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ointed Director General of all the shi<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>yards of Italy. The <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>er
went on to say:</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   "The a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ointment again confirms the general conviction that
Italian Jews are strongly favored and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotected by the Catholic
Church and that wealthy Jews in Italy are still very influential."</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I always acknowledge without a qualm these little injustices
to the clergy into which incom<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lete knowledge betrays me at rare
intervals. At the same time I must <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint out, in case you do not
know, Italian, that "<ent type = 'person'>Sacerdoti</ent>" means "Priests", so that this one
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotected Jew of whom I have heard was obviously a Roman Catholic
as well as a millionaire, and therefore a fit <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson, to come under
the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s mantle of Charity: which did not cover the 69,999 Jews
who were robbed and cast out.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   March 12 was not merely a real Yom Ki<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ur for the Jews of
Italy. It was the day on which, as I have elsewhere stated, the
sleek and treacherous <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riest, Msgr. Tiszo, went from Slovakia to
see <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> and arrange with him for the final betrayal, or sale, of
Czecho-Slovakia. That foul deed was certainly done with the
agreement of the Vatican. It made a final end of the Liberalism,
which the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> hated, of the Czechs, and it made solidly Catholic
Slovakia an inde<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>endent state, another member of the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s new
dream of a Catholic bloc and abjectly submissive to the Vatican. As
I said, you can believe if you like that Tiszo accom<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lished this
without consulting Rome. But the ste<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> meant far more. It finally
remained the great obstacle to <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>'s march to Russia and the
Balkans. How did the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> of Peace regard that? It is well known
that even Chamberlain was now convinced that war was absolutely
inevitable. The whole world saw it. Are we to su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ose that the new

considerable ability and I suggest the alternative view that he

Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an what they quite obviously wanted, and he <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>robably did not
realize how much they wanted that they did not make obvious.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   In this light we may review his <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace-efforts in the fateful
summer of 1939. The first was unfortunate. He was crowned on March
12 and he emerged from his week of <ent type = 'person'>Yogi</ent> meditation on the "9th.
Easter Sunday was to fall on A<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ril 9, and he had to have a
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>articularly fervent a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eal to the world for <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace ready for that
date. But on Good Friday <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> took the second ste<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> in his war
by invading Albania! The <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s biogra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>her tells us that he was
annoyed, in so far as consecrated <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersons can be, both by the
desecration of the holy day and the need to rewrite some <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assages
of his a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eal for <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace. To what extent he was really du<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed we do
not know. Catholics say that he wrote a letter to <ent type = 'person'>the King of Italy</ent>
to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>revent the invasion. It would be as futile as writing to the
king of toyland, but there is no evidence that such a letter was
ever written. Everybody in Italy knew -- was bound to know -- that
a large Italian force was concentrating at the Adriatic <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orts for
the invasion of Albania; and every thoughtful Italian must have
known that Albania was for <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> just the same stage in a
journey to the East as Czecho-Slovakia had been for <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>. But
whether or no it is true that <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> double-crossed his <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>artner
in crime by taking the ste<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>, in order to make sure that he got the
southern half of the Balkans for Italy, need not be discussed here,
and the desecration of Good Friday does not interest us. We will
examine the eastern ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ansion as a whole and the Vatican's relation
to it in a se<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arate essay.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>shot was that, while nice-minded <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le all over the
world read the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eal with the usual moist eyes and muddled
brains, for serious folk it was at the best a dam<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> squib, at the
worst a mockery. And the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> soon knew it. Many believe that,
while <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> has certainly not the vast <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lanning and organizing
intelligence with which Nazis credit him, he <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>robably does throw
off the general <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lans or imaginative scheme's which the massive
military and economic brain behind him then works out in detail.
However that may be, we see a steady and very able method in the
great <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lot: a ste<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>, very carefully <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ared (the Saar, the
Rhineland, Austria, etc.) every six months or so, then six months
of covert <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aration for and o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>en lying about the next ste<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>. After
Czecho-Slovakia the lying became useless. Only Dutchmen and
Belgians were du<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed by it. Poland was to be the next stage; and the
next stage meant war on a Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ean scale.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   There is evidence, which we will see later, that, as we should
assume, the Vatican knew this as well as the French and British
Foreign Offices. A fortnight after Easter the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>, his biogra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>her

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>that he o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ened the letter with his own hands and ke<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t the contents
secret. Only his Secretary of State, Maglione, knew what re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ly he
made to it. Is it fanciful to su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ose that it a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rised him of the
next ste<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> that <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> meditated? It was followed, the biogra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>her
says, by "feverish activity" at the Vatican, the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> consulting
his <ent type = 'person'>Nuncio</ent>s from Berlin and Warsaw and seeing numbers of bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s
from France, Germany, and Poland. As the quarrel about Dantzig, the
unmistakable herald of <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>'s next ste<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>, soon broke out, the
Vatican could not even <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>retend to be taken by sur<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rise.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   What, then, were all these efforts to secure <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace of which
the Catholic a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologist s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eaks? We ignore the Easter lyric. It
reminds us of one gangster sending a wreath to the funeral of
another. In May he suggested -- so unobtrusively that it could be
denied when the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lan failed -- a Five Power Conference over the
German-Polish dis<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ute. The five <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Powers</ent> were to be Poland, Germany,
Great Britain, France, and Italy. You may think him either
un<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ractical or insincere but the fact is that he wanted Russia,
which was dee<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ly interested, excluded, on his usual assum<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tion that
it was not a res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ectable Power, and Italy, which was not interested
and would intervene only to su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ort <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>, included. France, which
was now, to the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s annoyance, allied with Russia, and Great
Britain refused. The Conference would certainly not have checked
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It is said -- and, of course, denied -- that the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> then
suggested a Conference on the economic grounds of the world-unrest.
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> had been com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>laining for some time that Great Britain and
France were trying to starve the Axis economically, and that Tunis,
Jibute, and a share in the control of the Suez were vital economic
requirements of Italy and would entirely satisfy it; while his
troo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s were trying to cross Albania to Greece and his Fascist
toughs were encouraged to bawl in the streets and theaters that
Italy must have Savoy, Corsica, Malta, etc. <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> was <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>leading
that once the question of Dantzig and the Corridor was settled he
would lay aside his armor forever. Any man who wishes may assume
that the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> really believed them. His economic <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lan was an
attem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t to get Great Britain and a France that was already weakened
by treason to give them what they wanted. In any case his
suggestion was rejected as amateurish.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   These various <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osals are interesting only in connection
with the belief of many that the Vatican has as fine an
intelligence-service as any Chancellory in Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e. If that were so,
the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> would know that these <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>retended economic grievances of
Germany, Italy, and Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an were dishonest <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>retexts for crime. They
were based u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on two lies: over-<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulation and a disadvantage in
getting su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lies from <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arts of the world which were included in the
em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ires of Great Britain and France.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The grievance about over-<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulation is nauseous when we recall
how <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> for six years and <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> for fifteen years had been
whi<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ing u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> the birth rate by every means in their <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower; and in
this their action coincided with that of the Catholic clergy.
Neither in Italy nor Germany was there the least reticence about
the reasons for demanding early marriages and giving s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecial <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rizes
to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arents of large families. They wanted soldiers. "We were born </<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>to die for Germany" was <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ainted u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> in boys schools in that country,
and leading statesmen urged mothers to look anxiously for the first
mystic flicker of the "starlight of battle" in a baby boy's eyes.
The Italians were less absurd but equally frank. The men who will
be called to account in future history are the states-men and
writers of other countries who saw year by year this frenzied and
artificial attem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t to increase the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulation, accom<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anied by
hy<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ocritical <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>leas that the countries were already so
over<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulated, that they must have more territory. The Catholic
clergy were the worst offenders. They <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>retended to discover that
birth control was immoral. Their real <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ur<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ose in their ban on it
was to secure an increase of the Catholic <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulation while the non-
Catholic <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>racticed birth control.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   In <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint of fact, Germany was very far from over<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulated, and
Italy was by no mean's one of the most densely <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulated countries.
England has about 800 <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le to the square mile, while Italy has
only 350 and Germany 322. Belgium, Holland, and other countries
annexed by Germany on the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lea of wanting more "living room" for
its distressed <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulation are twice as densely <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulated as it is.
The whole economic <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lea of Germany, which the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> wanted gravely
discussed, stank with mendacity. Sir <ent type = 'person'>Norman Angell</ent>, one of the most
anxious of men to remove grounds of war, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roved years ago in a
s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecial study "that England had very little economic advantage from
its em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ire." You can trust the Canadians and Australians to see
that any advantage is mutual. <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> says re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eatedly and
em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hatically in Mein Kam<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>f that Germany does not want colonies: in
which he includes dominions of the British ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e. It wants land in
Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e, he insists, and we now see it clearly. He wants to reduce
Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e to economic servitude to the Nazis.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s biogra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>her com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lains that after a time both Great
Britain and Germany refused to take the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> further into their
confidence. We do not wonder. But, whether you <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>refer to believe
that he was not willing to be <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ushed out of the s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>otlight or that
he really thought he could hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> the interest of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace, he tried
again. He issued a very <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>retentious document in which he stated the
conditions of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace, and half the world began again to discuss the
marvelous sagacity and moral serenity of his famous "Five Points".</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It was, in <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint of fact, his worst effort. The material <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art
of his first and most im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortant <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint was: "A fundamental <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ostulate
of an honorable and just <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace is that of the right to life and
freedom of all nations, big and small, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>owerful and weak." It is
exas<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erating that most <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ers, in their eagerness to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lease
Catholic readers and advertisers, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>romised this as a very clear-
headed <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>iece of moral guidance in a world of confusion. Such a
right has been a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>latitude in <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olitical theory for more than half
a century. One is tem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ted to say ever since the ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>es were
com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>elled by the Italian armies to let the inhabitants of Central
Italy decide by <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lebiscite how they <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>referred to live. But for
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Pacelli</ent>-Pius to formulate this <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rinci<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le solemnly to the world in
the year 1939 was a breath-taking <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>iece of audacity.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   As I showed in an earlier booklet, four-fifths of the
Catholics of the world live under a Fascist regime, and they are

im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osed u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on them under <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Pacelli</ent> and at his direct instigation. I
have shown how freedom disa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eared almost whenever he visited a
country or it came under Catholic authorities: in 20 Re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublics of
Central and South America, Portugal, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, and
in the end France and Belgium. The Black International was solely
res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>onsible for robbing the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le of Vienna of their right to
choose their mode of life and cordially coo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erated in de<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riving the
S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aniards of that right. The Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>acy had been an intimate ally of
the Fascists for ten years in refusing the Italians the means of
ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ressing their wishes and of the Nazis for six years. It had
consented by silence to the theft of that right from the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le of
Abyssinia, Bohemia, Moravia, and Albania. It demanded almost every
month that the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le of Russia and Mexico should be violently
de<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rived of that right. And the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> crowns this formidable list of
encroachments on the liberty of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>les which he ins<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ired or
blessed by assuring the world that to res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ect the right of self-
determination is the first condition of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace it ardently
desires! I need not go on to ask what serious <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ros<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ect he thought
there was of Germany, Italy, and Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an, the only three <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>owers to

for candid reflections on the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s actions, was to ignore him and
his Five Points. The other <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oints were <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>latitudes. The second
condition of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace was disarmament: a very <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ractical thing to say
in 1939. Then we get counsels to learn from the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ast, to consider
the demands of racial minorities, and to cultivate mutual goodwill
and a sense of justice. It was like <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osing to sell a man

in 1929 and had broadcast them sternly whenever a violation of them

would have saved the honor of the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>acy. He could not. Authority
is the first <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rinci<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le and coercion the indis<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ensable instrument of

rumors in Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e and the Vatican <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress bureau is as <ent type = 'person'>Pegler</ent> has
shown, one of the leakiest or most venal, but at this stage the
secret was guarded with un<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>recedented rigor. If you will next
notice the significant fact that the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> refrained from an
ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>licit condemnation of the invasion of Poland as carefully as in
the case of Abyssinia and Albania -- he certainly never used a word
to com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>are with his language about the Russians when they sim<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ly
took back Rusalan <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovinces which Germany would have annexed -- you
will hardly hesitate in your guess what the secret was. The <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>
was informed of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lan to invade Poland and was induced to assent
on certain conditions: <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>robably that the occu<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ation of Poland would
be tem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orary and was indis<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ensable for the attack on Russia, that
religion would be res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ected in Poland, and that the Church would
get concessions in Germany and great o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortunities in Russia. The
idea seems to have been that the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> would <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersuade the very
docile Poles to submit on these conditions and would continue to
inflame them against Russia, the only Power that could save them.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   In refraining from condemning the invasion of Poland -- I do
not count later <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotests when the Catholic, body was threatened
with annihilation -- the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> could not <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lead, as he did in the
case of Norway, that the Catholic body was small and he must think
of his German Church and not offend the Nazis. Whether or no that
is a res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ectable ground of action in a <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>, the fact is that there
were twice as many sincere Catholics in Poland as in the <ent type = 'person'>Reich</ent>. A
cynic would add that, though it had more adherents and of a more
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assionate loyalty, the Polish Church was not a quarter as rich as
the German Church. We will, of course, not admit that the Vatican
was moved by so <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofane a consideration, but the numbers are
indis<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>utable. We have seen that by 1939 there were not 12,000,000
Catholics left in Germany: <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>robably not more than 10,000,000. No
one dis<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>utes that of the 33,000,000 <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le of Poland more than
20,000,000 were sincere Catholics and several further million were
com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulsory members of the Church: a ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e of Catholic of which the
Vatican seems to be equally <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roud.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   This strange situation requires an historical ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lanation, but
for even a short summary of the history of Catholicism in Poland I
must refer to my A<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eal to Reason Library (No. 5., "Roman
Catholicism in Poland and Russia") and confine myself here to a few
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oints which are essential to understand what follows. There is, as
I have often <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ointed out, a close <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arallel between Poland and
Ireland, es<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecially if you think of Catholic Ireland before British
Liberalism relieved many of its grievances. Both countries suffered
from their geogra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hical <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition, on the outskirts of civilization,
and in both cases this gave the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests a rich o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortunity to
ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loit the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oor and very backward <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulation. And just as the

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>Ireland and brought <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le closer together, so had the
long tyranny of Orthodox Catholic Russia in Poland. While, however,
Britain had very materially modified its treatment of the Irish
more than half a century ago, Russian tyranny had continued until
1917.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   We thus recognize a very serious traditional ground for that
hostility to Russia which <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>revented Poland from entering into
alliance with the one Power that could <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotect it, but it is due
mainly to the Black International that hostility became worse after
1918 and com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>letely destroyed the chances of checking Nazism on
that side.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   At Versailles, to which the Poles sent <ent type = 'person'>Paderewski</ent> to lull the
ears of statesmen with his music, a Re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublic of 30,000,000
inhabitants was set u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>. Not much more than half of these were
Poles, so that there were few <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arts of Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e in which the
Conference of Versailles sowed the seeds of a future war so
recklessly as in Poland. In <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>articular the Poles claimed Russian
territory (White Russia and the Galician Ukraine) containing seven
or eight million <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le of alien race and generally alien religion,
and, to the disgust of the British re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resentatives, the French
bulldozed <ent type = 'person'>Wilson</ent>, who reeled under the shower of weird geogra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hical
names (and lies) into consenting. The Poles also claimed Silesia
from Germany, but it was so obviously far more German than Polish
that the League of Nations was directed to take a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lebiscite.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The time came when the French were disgusted with their Polish
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>et -- they had su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orted it as a bulwark against Bolshevism -- and
they gave away the fact that the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lebiscite was corru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t. See the
Catholic <ent type = 'person'>Rene Martel</ent>'s La France et la Pologne (1931). The Poles
had formed a s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecial organization for corru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ting and intimidating
voters and officials, and one of the three directors of it was
Msgr, Adamski, Catholic Bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> of Posen. The Black International
had begun its record in Poland, and there is no other <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art of the
world in which it has <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roceeded with such gross inhumanity, as we
shall see <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resently. The vote was still 700,000 for Germany and
400,000 for Poland, and the Commissioners decided to divide the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovince. This division was, carried out with the same corru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tion,
the richest districts going to Poland even when the great majority
of the inhabitants were found to be Germans. They had to sell out
to Poles, at a heavy loss, and transfer to Germany. Still the Poles
were not content. The League of Nations <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ermitted them to take
advantage of Russia's distress and seize Vilna and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art of
Lithuania. Ever since that <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriod of grab and corru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tion there has
been a monument on German soil facing Poland with the inscri<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tion:
"Germans, never forget of what blind hatred has robbed you."</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   How in s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ite of all this greed and the large loans extended by
France and Britain, Poland sank to the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oorest

want to know what ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loitation really is -- cannot be discussed
here. The <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint of interest to us is that the country no sooner rid
itself of the tyranny of Czarist Russia than it set u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> a still more
galling tyranny over its own minorities, and in this the Black
International worked in intimate coo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eration with the Dictator

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>tears as we read the record of his virtues in all our <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ers, was,
not to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut too fine a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint on it, a brute and a crook. He had led
the Poles who fought for Germany against us in the 1914-1918 war,
and they had not thought it discreet to send him to Versailles. He
had joined the White War against Russia, which he hated with all
the bitterness of (like <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent>) a renegade Socialist, and only
the French had saved him from losing Poland to them. He disgusted
every grou<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oliticians, and the Socialists saved him from ruin
and he then sent their leaders to a fortress and tortured them
exactly (even to the guards <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>utting excrement in their food) as
Nazis later tortured Jews in Germany.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   As far as I can discover <ent type = 'person'>Pilsudski</ent> never became a sincere
Catholic -- again like his friend <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> -- but he acted with
and on behalf of the Church, which is more <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>owerful than in Ireland
or Peru. Let me ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lain at once that the a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>alling <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecution that
lasted twenty years in Poland was a joint affair of Church and
state and aimed equally at destroying the nationality and the
religion of the immense non-Polish minorities. In the Galician
Ukraine alone there were 1,000,000 Catholic Poles, 1,250,000 Jews,
4,000,000 Greek Uniates (acknowledging the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> but with a Greek
liturgy), and 4,000,000 Orthodox or Greek Catholics. In the west
were about 1,000,000 German Protestants; and there were, of course,
re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resentatives of all minorities and not a few ske<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tics in the
cities. For twenty years every device of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecution and brutality
was used to destroy the religious liberty and the national tongues
and customs of these minorities, although the Poles had given
Versailles a solemn engagement to res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ect them. I am concerned only
with the coercion in religious matters, and the reason for
recalling it here is obvious. During all the years when the Vatican
and the Black International in every country, but es<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecially in the
United States and Canada, was ins<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>iring, on the ground of its
"<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecution of religion", that hatred of Russia which has been of
incalculable service to the Nazis, this same Black International
not only knew that there was no <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecution of religion in Russia
-- it was Polish cons<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>iracy that brought <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>unishment on the
Catholics there but was conducting a quite fiendish <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecution of
religion in Poland and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>reventing the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress in other countries,
with only four exce<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tion's amongst all the dailies of Canada, the
United States, and Great Britain, from <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublishing the facts. The
honorable exce<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tions were the Toronto Evening Telegram, the Chicago
Daily News, the New York Herald-Tribune, and the Manchester
Guardian (England); and the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecutions had been in <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rogress for
eleven years when they discovered it.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The Ukrainians of Galicia had sent a de<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>utation to Versailles
to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotest against incor<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oration in Poland and claim inde<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>endence.
The French had got the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>etition dismissed, and the Poles had
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>romised to res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ect their minority-rights. Six months later they
addressed to the French a memoir (Les atrocites <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olonaises en
<ent type = 'person'>Galicie Ukrainienne</ent>) which showed a very brutal <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecution,
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olitical and religious raging over the whole vast area. In one
overcrowded and filthy jail 200 of the 2000 <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>risoners were Orthodox
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests. More than 1000 <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests had been arrested and Polish Roman
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests stalked like ghouls in the rear of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olice and soldiers
taking over the schools and cha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>els of the dis<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ossessed Greek
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests. The soldiers were instructed to subject the Greek <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests </<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>to every kind of humiliation and mockery so as to break the
attachment of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le. But the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>easants and farmers reacted with
the fiery <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotests that might have been ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ected, and "whole
villages were de<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulated by massacre." The women were ra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed and
beaten, the men shot by the thousand. In other words, the Catholic
Poles were <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>er<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>etrating in Poland twenty years ago just those
atrocities which are now exercised u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on themselves by the Germans,
and, exce<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t for this authoritative account in French, which was not
translated into any other language, the world was not <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ermitted to
know anything about it.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It is an im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortant secondary aim of these booklets to warn the
reader of the extraordinary extent and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ernicious nature of the
Catholic censorshi<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress and of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublicity generally. Just
about that time, twenty years ago, I s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ent six months in New York
and when I suggested to a well-known <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublisher, who asked me for a
book, that I should write on the Catholic Church, he refused and
assured me that I would not find a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublisher for such work in New
York. Few <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublishers have any sym<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>athy with the Church -- the only
one I found with such <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersonal admiration of it was, curiously, my
Rationalist friend G.H. Putnam -- but the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress would not bring to
the notice of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublic, in the usual way, books that were
(offensive to Catholics", and they submitted that it was useless to
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublish them. Libraries were often intimidated from buying them and
booksellers from ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osing them for sale. Haldeman-Julius is the
only <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublisher in America during the last ten years who has enabled
me to tell truths of the kind I tell here, yet it will be evident
that the world would have been far better equi<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed to meet the
darkening future if the whole truth had been <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut before it year
after year.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   I have devoted a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aragra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>h to events of twenty year's ago
because they were but the first <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>age in a cha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ter of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecution
which covers the whole intervening <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriod and is very material from
several angles to my <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resent theme. The matter not only affords a
very striking illustration of the su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ression of truth which it is
im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortant to know. It shows that the worst blunders of Versailles,
which we blamed so fluently, were enormously aggravated by the
conduct of the Catholic Poles. It ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lains that bitter hostility of
the Poles to the Russians which caused them to lend a hand in every
cons<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>iracy against the Soviet government since 1919 and brought
u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on the Catholic <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests in Russia, most of whom were Poles, the
legitimate legal <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roceedings which the Vatican and the American
bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resented as <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecution of religion. It shows that
outrages as vile as any committed by the Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s in China and now by
Nazis in many lands were being <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>er<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>etrated by the most <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofoundly
Catholic state in the world for twenty years while nice-minded folk
everywhere were wondering whether the new barbarism was not due to
a decay of religion. And it <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>uts in a strange light that standing
excuse of the Vatican for its conduct, that the extension of its
rule over further millions of men or the maintenance of that rule
over million's who seem to be rejecting it is so im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortant for the

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   If ever this a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>alling record of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecution in Poland by the
Catholic Poles is forced u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on general <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublic notice we shall 
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>robably hear the usual distinction between the action of a local
hierarchy and the action of the Vatican, I need not re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eat that we
are here considering the conduct of the Black International as a
whole not sim<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ly of the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>s, and we are not embarrassed by being
unable to trace in every case the instructions of the Vatican to
national Churches. But this distinction is not even <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lausible in
the case of Poland. The <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resent <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> Pius XII, has, we saw, an
intimate knowledge of German affairs, and no <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lea of ignorance or
misinformation can be made in connection with any of his relations
to that country. But the late, <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> Plus XI, had the same <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersonal
interest in Poland, his <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ontificate (1922-1939) exactly coincides
with the Catholic Reign of Terror in that country.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Any writer must dwell with reluctance on the misconduct of a
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le which bore, and with great heroism, the first brutal onset
of the Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ean War and suffers so bitterly for it today. It is,
however, necessary to tell the whole truth if we are to a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>reciate
the insincerity of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>retensions of the Black International, the
truth about its conduct, and the mendacity with which a good deal
of that conduct is concealed. It is fortunately easier in America
than elsewhere to learn the truth. When the Chicago Daily News and
the Herald-Tribune disturbed the clerical folk who were raving
about <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecution in Russia -- Jewish rabbis joining in <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rocessions
with bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s in New York while financiers a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lauded from the
windows -- by showing that the real <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecution was in Poland,
officials in Washington answered inquirers with the suave
assurances of the Polish Catholic re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resentatives that it was "all
lies." But there is a large body of Ukrainians in the United
States, and in 1931 they collected and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublished a large volume of
testimony (letters, re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orts, journalistic accounts, etc.) of the
outrages.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   No im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>artial <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson who reads this (Atrocities in the Ukraine,
1931, edited by <ent type = 'person'>Emil Revyuk</ent>) can for a moment doubt the truth of
the statements. The authority is absolute. The details are
revolting. The defense urged by some is that, the Ukrainians had
rebelled against their Polish masters. Yes, after years of brutal
treatment in violation of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>romise's made by Poland when it
received the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovince. But a nation of 30,000,000, s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ending a very
high <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortion of its revenue on an army which could stand u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> to
Germany for three weeks hardly needed torture and brutality to
su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress any revolt in a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovince. Flogging, with whi<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s loaded with
wire or iron, was a daily occurrence. Pregnant women and girls were
beaten. Heated irons were a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lied to the feet. Water, sometimes
mixed with oil, was forced down their nostrils. Men -- not merely
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>easants but <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rofessional men and scholars -- were de<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rived of
slee<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> until they became half-insane. There were 200,000 in jail in
1930 and torture was used lavishly on them to make them betray
others. The brutality was even worse in 1934 and 1935, though it
seems to have relented a little after the death of <ent type = 'person'>Pilsudski</ent> in the
latter year.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The first encyclical that the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> issued in 1939 de<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lored

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>readers that bestiality of the kind that will make sociologists of
the future hesitate to call our social order a civilization had
been going on for twenty years in the most religious country in
Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e. Poland was to 1939 far more Catholic than Eire or Peru. A
French Catholic visited it in 1932 and wrote an article on it in
the Catholic Revue des Deux Mondes (February 1, 1933). He describes
exhibitions of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>iety in <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublic to which you will find no <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arallel
in any other country. American Catholics were, at the time, telling
non-Catholic neighbors that if they could only see religious life
in a solidly Catholic country they would <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erceive the beauty of the
Church. Well, Poland was the most solidly Catholic country in the
world, and its <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests and bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s were equally behind this
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecution, which extended also to German Protestants and Polish
Freethinkers, with the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oliticians of the <ent type = 'person'>Pilsudski</ent> school, They
were just as eager to destroy the Uniate, Orthodox, and Protestant
Churches as the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oliticians were to make everybody thoroughly
Polish. That is abundantly shown in Revyuk's book.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It is hardly necessary to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint out how these facts make a
mockery of the Vatican's assurance to the world that when the
Russian troo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s entered this Galician Ukraine in 1939 they committed
outrages as the German troo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s did in Posen. Roman Catholic Poles
and the few other Roman Catholics in the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovince fought against
the Russians, but what was likely to be the mutual attitude of the
Ukrainians and the Russian's after 20 years of this agony? The
Ukrainians hated the Poles mortally. The Russians were an army of
liberation. The jails were o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ened. The farms were restored to their
owners. But the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al lie was re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roduced res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ectfully in the world-
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress. I remember very few <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ers which even troubled to ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lain
that the two <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovinces taken over by Russia, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>al<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ably to antici<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ate
a German annexation of them, were Russian <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rovinces wantonly torn
from their natural unity by Versailles, but I do not remember a
single <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>er that ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lained what grounds the Ukrainians had for
relief and how bitterly they hated the Poles.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Another reason why I enlarge on this <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ainful cha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ter of Polish
history just before the war is because it has a vital bearing on
one of the grossest blunders of the democracies and greatest
advantages of the Nazis, the estrangement from Russia. Since I
cannot <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut before the reader any corres<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ondence of the Vatican with
the Polish hierarchy he must decide on a general knowledge of
Church methods how far the Vatican knew and a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roved of the brutal
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecution I fancy he will not have much difficulty -- but that
the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>acy inflamed the Catholic Poles against Russia is <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>atent.
The Poles had, we saw, very strong traditional grounds to hate
Tsarist Russia, and <ent type = 'person'>Pilsudski</ent> had carried his hatred over to Soviet
Russia and had gravely im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>licated the Roman Catholics in Russia in
the White War and subsequent cons<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>iracies. Grave difficulties were
bound to arise when there was a common frontier between the most
religious and the most irreligious country in Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e. It will,
however, not be questioned that these difficulties were immensely
aggravated by the a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eals to the Catholic world of the Pa<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>acy to
work for the extinction of Bolshevism after 1926. It was in large
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art owing to this that the democracies lost the last o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ortunity
of either <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>reventing the war or making it short and restricted.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Poland had signed a non-aggression <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>act with Germany in 1934,
and there cannot be the least doubt that, imbued as it was with the
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s idea of a crusade against Russia, in which Germany must <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lay
at least the leading <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art, Poland regarded this as a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aratory
condition for the eventual attack on Russia. When <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> and
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> had hamstrung Czecho-Slovakia, Catholic Poland and
Catholic Hungary had, like wolves waiting until a buffalo is
wounded, bitten large <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ieces of territory out of its flanks. On
January 25, 1939, <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> had sent Ribbentro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>, the vilest agent of
his more treacherous moves, to Warsaw to re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resent Germany at the
celebration of the fifth anniversary of the non-aggression <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>act. It
was, he said in his s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eech, "one of the firmest bases of Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ean
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace." What children these Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eans were the historian will one
day reflect! Germany was then, he knew, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lotting the destruction of
Poland and a world war.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Ribbentro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> returned to Germany to join in the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lot against
Czecho-Slovakia in which, as I have elsewhere ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lained, it
received most valuable hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> from the Black International. The
Germans entered Prague on March 15 (1939), while the new <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> was
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aring his moving address on <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace and charity; and the world
began to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>are for what seemed to be the inevitable war. Most of
my neighbors in London had gas-masks by that date and looked
forward with amazing a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>athy -- or was it lack of imagination? -- to
the horrors that were <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>redicted. The French signed a mutual
defensive alliance with Poland. In fact, in the course of the next
few months France and Great Britain had such alliances also with
Rumania, Greece, and Turkey.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   We can imagine some im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erfectly informed reader of the next
generation exclaiming im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>atiently: But why string together these
small, scattered, and not wholly reliable nations and omit the one
great <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ower, Soviet Russia, which was Germany's natural enemy and
was worth all the others <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut together? We did not ask the question
at the time because we knew the answer. These Catholic countries
and even Great Britain regarded an a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roach to Russia much as a
Ba<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tist mothers meeting would regard a suggestion, in case of need,
to call in the aid of a gunman to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotect their virtue. For that
the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> had a very large <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art of the res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>onsibility.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Naturally there were a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roaches, of a sort. The French signed
a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>act with Russia, almost useless because it did not include a
military alliance, in A<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ril. The Vatican <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rom<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tly condemned it. The
British asked Russia to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>romise military aid to Poland and Rumania,
but only in such form and measure as those <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>owers decided, and they
would not <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>romise British aid to Russia if it was attacked. Russia,
sore about the insulting exclusion from Munich, rightly distrusting
a Britain which, it knew, regarded it as an outlaw, refused. Poland
refused to have adequate Russian armies in it, and the little
Baltic states, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rizes set u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> by Versailles for the first grabber,
also refused. Great Britain half-heatedly <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ushed on. It sent a
di<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lomatic mission, of a character it would not send to any other
country, to Moscow, then a military mission of the same inferior
quality. Russia did not need to read how one of the Blim<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s of a
London club had said: "We may, of course, have to get Russia to
hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>, but, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lease God it will not come to that." It, in August 23,
sent the old women of the clubs into hysterics by announcing that </<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>it had signed a non-aggression <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>act with Germany. A few weeks later
it sent the Nazis into what we might call a subdued hysteria by
snatching the Galician Ukraine -- for reasons which I have surely
fully ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lained -- from under their guns.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   We quite understand Russia. We also now understand Poland,
which entered u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on its three-years war-agony on Se<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tember 1st, and
its three-years <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace-agony a few weeks later. Only one feature in
that year of tragic blunders concerns us here. Poland, which
thought it had been following the luminous lead of the Church for
so many years, had been led by the nose. The brave, ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loited,
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erversely educated <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le had been cursed with blundering leaders
who were in closer alliance with the Church than leaders were in
any other Catholic country. They had brought u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on the land the
contem<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t of Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e and had made it refuse the aid of the big
brother who, with real aid from the British and French fleets,
Rumania, Yugoslavia, and Greece might have averted its tragic fate.
The <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oles <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aid for their <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>iety. Little did the French dream that
they also, the least religious <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le in Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e after the Russians,
Would soon be led by the Black International, and without the
redeeming trait of honor and bravery which we accord to the Poles,
into same black <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>it. Never was there before such lack of 
foresight in an age of mortal danger. We know why the statesmen and
churchmen of democratic countries were reluctant to face realities.

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   On Se<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tember 1st, 1939, began, with the invasion of Poland,
the greatest war, it maybe the most terrible and tragic three-year
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriod, in the whole of history. The aggression-mongers, the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s 
biogra<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>her affirms, thrust him aside and excluded him from their
counsels. "When the swords flash let the lawyers be silent" said an
old Roman <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roverb. The new Roman a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lied it to churchmen: <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent>
assured the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> that he would see that Rome was res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ected as a
sacred city, and, although Italian <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lanes have taken <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art in the
foul bombing of London, Rome has never been bombed. <ent type = 'person'>Churchill</ent>
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersistently refuses to tell why. Perha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s the Catholic authorities
of the United States and the British Em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ire could tell us. The
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>, to make doubly sure that he would remain out of heaven some
years longer, had a luxurious shelter <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ared under an ancient

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace: certainly not have <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osed economic conferences, as he did,
to make the aggressive <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>owers still stronger by conceding territory
for which they need not ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>end any of their forces. Indeed, the
whole world knew at that time that only one nation threatened its
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace, Germany. The Italian and Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anese jackals would not move
until the lion had scattered a few cor<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ses about the landsca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e. So
the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s function, unless America a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologetic literature is
admitted to be insincere, was clear. He ought to have branded as
criminal in the highest degree the ambition to annex and ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>loit
other countries, one by one, of which Germany had given am<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roof. He ought to have condemned in the most ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>licit and severest
terms the glorification of war by the German and Italian leaders,
the lies they <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ut forward about encirclement and over-<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ulation,
the racial arrogance with which they were <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oisoning their <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le,
the murderous outrages with which they had begun to say to all the
little nations of Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e: See what you will get if you resist us.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   It is hardly worthwhile discussing the immediate <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>retexts of
the o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ening of hostilities. For my <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art -- I have never hesitated
to say that Dantzig was a German city and ought never to have been
taken from it, and that to take from it a slice of East Prussia
measuring 260 miles by 80 to give the Poles -- Polish ca<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>italists
and French bond-holders, that is to say -- a "Corridor" to the sea
was little less monstrous. But no one in Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ected Germany to
be satisfied with these. The situation was as clear as the Eiffel
Tower at Paris. Germany meant to take Poland, and England and
France were sworn to regard such a ste<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> as <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roof of a large
aggressive design and declare war. Those of us who knew the facts
reflected, sadly, that the democracies could hardly choose a weaker
case to cham<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ion than that of the synthetic Poland they had set u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>
at Versailles, the Fascist state which had bludgeoned its
minorities for twenty years. It was all the worse that, as was soon
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roved, they could give no hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> to Poland and were not even able to
hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> themselves.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The very difficult and still obscure question of France
require's a se<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>arate book but I can s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eak for England. About mid-
day on that fateful Sunday the news was broadcast that Chamberlain
had declared war on Germany. By an extraordinary blunder the sirens
wailed within half an hour and, to make matters worse in my own
street, a stu<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>id warden gave the signal to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>are for gas. I will
not describe the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>anic -- which does not detract from the fine
courage of most Londoners when the blow fell later -- but it
reminded us of one thing: we had no armament whatever for the war
we had declared. It has since trans<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ired that England then had only
18 good fighter <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lanes. Germany had thousands. Nine months
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aration had done little more than give most of us gas-masks --
I had none -- accommodations for a million or so in the hos<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>itals
and coffins for hundreds of thousands. Yet for once Englishmen
might be <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roud of the folly of their government. It cried a halt to
brutality and criminal greed.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   And the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> had nothing to say. Someone ought to collect a

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>today the funniest -- and even bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>'s mumble it -- is that he is
the Father of All Peo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>les and must not take sides! We had been told
that it was just that <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition of cosmo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olitan and international
judge which made him a unique and incorru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tible tribunal. Was there
some doubt from the moral <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>oint of view on which side the guilt
lay? Can one even imagine Britain and France, with their miserable
armament, having any other aim than to cheek a brutal
aggressiveness? In <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lain English, and in the light of the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s
own words, this <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lea means that he would not denounce a wrong if
his interests and those of his Black International were to suffer
for it in any country. And that is the gist of our accusation. The
Black International <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ursues its own interests though it be through
the ruin of civilization and of all human idealism.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   As I have re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eatedly <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ointed out, it is rather this Black
International than the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> that interests us. We must not allow
ourselves to be distracted when the end comes by Catholic or any
other criticisms of Eugenio <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Pacelli</ent>. Any <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> would have acted as
he did. No <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> ever acted otherwise. The great French scholar, A.
Loisy, scourged the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> during the last war for exactly the same
conduct. And the a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ologist has not sim<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ly to ex<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lain way his
"neutrality," though that is a vice in a moralist in face of a
grave crime. He had hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed bring on the war. He had made it easy
for <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> the annexation of Austria. He had coo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erated with him
still more closely in the destruction of Czecho-Slovakia. He had
turned a blind eye to his vile conduct in Germany and hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed to
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rotect his intervention in S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain. He had been in large <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art
res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>onsible for the weakness and incoherence of the world-
o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition to him by his <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>reaching of hatred of Russia -- and --
not to s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eak of matters which will be discussed in later booklets
-- he had encouraged his monstrous <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lans by allying himself with
the two other <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>owers which had similar <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lans.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   But when we say that the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> was silent we mean only that no
clear messages were <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rinted in the <ent type = 'person'>Osservatore</ent> or broadcast from
the Vatican Radio or sent out to the world in encyclicals. His one
encyclical at this time, when the flames of war were lit from
Poland to England, was, as we saw, a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lea that the world, not one

Catholic Action must come to the rescue. Catholic Action! It had
been busy in the Polish Ukraine for twenty years, in S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain for
Several years, in Hungary and Portugal, in Austria and South
America. No one took any notice.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

care two <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ins whether this can or cannot be <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roved. One thing we do
know as we have already seen. The summer had seen "feverish
activity" at the Vatican, and an outstanding <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art of this was
corres<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ondence with the <ent type = 'person'>Nuncio</ent>s at Berlin, Warsaw, and Paris and
the rece<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tion of German and Polish bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s. As the whole world was
now discussing the chances of <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aring for an invasion of Poland
and a general war we shall hardly be accused of undue
sus<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>iciousness's if we suggest that this was the chief to<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ic of the
very busy corres<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ondence and interviews. What was decided we do not
know. The most sensible theory in view of the facts is that <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>
informed the Vatican that he was taking over Poland, <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eacefully, as</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

his advice to submit.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   However that may be, he must have had an understanding with
the German hierarchy, and we know how it behaved. lt was as
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>ite as the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> youth. <ent type = 'person'>Edith Moore</ent> quotes a number of the
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ronouncements of the German bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s in her No Friend of Democracy
(1941). The very sound and im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>artial Manchester Guardian (May 24,
1940) thus stated the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition:</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   "Among the higher ranks of the Catholic clergy a decisive
majority desire to see the victory of the <ent type = 'person'>Reich</ent> or at least a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace
that will leave Germany's <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>olitical and military strength
unim<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aired. At the same time they still look to an eventual
Catholic-Conservative restoration. The National Socialist State
has, it seems, been able to reach an understanding with the
Catholic leaders. Assurances have been given as to the status of
the Church in the Bohemian-Moravian Protectorate and in Germany
itself. The s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecial <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition of the Catholic Church in Poland is
also to receive due recognition. In s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ite of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ersecution of
laymen and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>riests by the Nazis, in s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ite of all the attacks u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on
the Christian religion now ho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>es have been raised among the German
Catholics as a result of these negotiations."</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   As I suggested, the hierarchy -- and the references to Bohemia
and Poland seem to bring in the Vatican -- was soothed with
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>romises of greater advantages to the Church and in view of these
saw nothing of the enormity of the annexation of Norway, Denmark,
and Holland which had then taken <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lace. On August 22 the bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s
held their annual meeting at Fulda, a  national shrine from which
they were accustomed to give guidance to their Church. Usually only
a score of bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s attended, but this year the whole 45 were
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resent, and, according to the German <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ress, the advice they gave
to the faithful was a very em<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hatic "Heil <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>." By this time, I
may recall, the German army had swe<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>t over Holland, Belgium, and
France and, exas<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erated by the o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osition of those countries, had
stoo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed to outrages and infamies which shocked the world. Yet the
German <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ers revealed that the bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s decided that "after the
com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>letion of the final German victory s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ecial ceremonies of
gratitude to the German troo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s and of loyalty to <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> will be
announced." It was said that the bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s submitted their <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>osals
to the Vatican and that the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> who was at the time bargaining
once more with <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent> (Catholic Herald, August 9, 1940, and
Catholic Tablet, Se<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tember 21, 1940), forbade them to <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ublish their
resolutions: clearly to avoid scandal in Britain and America.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   The Tablet found a significance in the fact the final address
at the Fulda Conference was given by the bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> of Osnabruck, who
was a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ointed by <ent type = 'person'>Goering</ent> the re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>resentative of the Catholic Church
in the Prussian State Council, and the New York Times re<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orted that
"the leaders of the Catholics in Germany . . . exhort their

righteous cause of the German nation under the leadershi<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> of
Chancellor <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>." The hierarchy, in other words, did not merely
urge Catholics to su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ort <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>, but went out of their way to </<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>affirm that the miserable bandit had "a righteous cause." A British
Catholic <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>er, the Herald (October 18, 1940) quoted a <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>assage from
a Pastoral Letter which the chief Catholic cha<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lain, Bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>
<ent type = 'person'>Garkowsky</ent>, addressed to all Catholics in the Army, Navy, and Air
Force. He said:</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   "The German <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le have a clear conscience and are aware which
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le will have to bear the res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>onsibility before God and history
for the gigantic struggle that is now going on. The German <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le
know who <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rimarily started this war. Just as certainly as God is
the Father of all Peo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>les, He is also the judge of right and wrong,
of honor and deceit."</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   Those who find it <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ossible to imagine that these German
bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s honestly blamed Britain and France for the war because,
after a reiterated solemn warning, they had declared that they
would o<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ose further aggression may do so. I would not argue the
matter. Most of us can see nothing but nauseous hy<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ocrisy in German
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>relates who invoke God as a witness to the righteousness of the
Nazi cause and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rogram.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   We have already seen that the new <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> had, a year before,
issued an Encyclical, Summi Potitificatus, on the state of the
world it was very wicked because the nations had lost the Christian
sense of brotherhood -- so cons<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>icuous, of course, in the
nineteenth century and earlier -- and had ado<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ted theories of
racial su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eriority. Even Catholics in England and France were very
uneasy in commenting on this. Could the <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ossibly mean that the
democracies were at least so close to the dictatorshi<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s in these
res<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ects that he was not called u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>on to draw any distinction? And
why did he not say that he meant Germany, Italy, and Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an? One
French Catholic writer evaded the difficulty by saying that "in
time of war the Church of Rome has to observe an im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>artial
reserve." The same writer said, incidently, that in no other war in
history was good so clearly on one side and evil on the other. The
<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> was just a moral coward, and a consequence of his cowardice is
seen in these quotations from the German bisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>s. Their stern
inexorable moral guide left them free to tell <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le that the
vilest cam<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>aign in modern history, both in its aim and in its
<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rocedure, had the full a<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>roval of the Black International and
their God.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   But the cordiality between the butchers and the black-cassocks
was never long maintained in its <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>urity. <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>, who seems to have
regarded the com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>laisance of the hierarchy and the Vatican with
com<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lete cynicism, threatened a new blow at the Church in the
S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ring of 1941. He returned to the ideas of Mein Kam<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>f and said
that both Protestant and Catholic Churches must be blended in one
Christian body which must be strictly "national" or inde<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>endent of
Roman authority and ada<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ted in its moral teaching to Nazi ideas.
The <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent>'s s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>okesman on the Vatican Radio now discovered some moral
courage -- not in excess, it is true -- and summoned German
Catholics to "wake u<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> and see clearly the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>agan tendencies which
were s<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>reading everywhere." The sordid behavior of the Gesta<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>o and
the soldiers in half of Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e -- in the concentration cam<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>'s of
Germany itself, in Austria and Bohemia, and now in Norway, Holland,

   THE WAR AND PAPAL INTRIGUE</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>Russia can be made to bear the greater <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>art of the censure. The
bloody ruling of this intoxicated blonde beast over Euro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e must be
viewed with "im<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>artial reserve." But to tam<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>er with the Church and
the interest of the Vatican . . . And still the hierarchy su<ent type = 'person'>p</ent><ent type = 'person'>p</ent>orted
the war. The Archbisho<ent type = 'person'>p</ent> of Freiburg, who had denounced the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>lot to
the Vatican, added:</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   "Far be it from me in this terrible struggle to say anything
that would turn aside the energies of the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le or <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>rejudice their
devotion to their country. Everyone who thinks as a German desires
to secure for his country a lasting <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eace with honor."</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   With honor! There's the rub. It was left to <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Hitler</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>Goering</ent>,
Goebbel's, Ribbentro<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>, and <ent type = 'person'>Himmler</ent> to inter<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ret the <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>hrase. They
smiled and <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ushed ahead, and we shall later find them again
courting the Vatican.</<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>

<<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>>   When Eugenio <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Pacelli</ent> became <ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Po<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e</ent> in 1939 he had to choose a

benediction of corru<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>tion in S<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ain and Austria, by his intrigues in

the friend of Germany, Italy, and Ja<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>an, hel<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>ed to make the world

<ent ty<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>e = '<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>erson'>Mussolini</ent> was flaunted before his eyes, say one word in

International which he controlled sanctified every outrage and
egged on the German <ent type = 'person'>p</ent>eo<ent type = 'person'>p</ent>le in the most criminal aggression and most
