<p>    THE CHURCH'S VILE RECORD IN SPAIN</p>

<p>   Some year<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> ago I <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>trolled on a <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ummer day through the drow<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>y
<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>treet<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> of Toledo, an ancient city in the center of Spain. A
thou<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>and year<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> ago it wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> one of the riche<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t and mo<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t populou<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
citie<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> in Europe. More than a quarter of a million vivid,
pro<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>perou<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, bright-eyed folk had filled it<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> narrow <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>treet<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> and
bought luxurie<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> from every part of the world in it<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> teeming <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tore<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>.
Such wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> the fame of it<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> craft<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>men that the "Toledo Blade" wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ought from end to end in Europe and i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>till famou<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> in literature.
How high Spain would have ri<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>en if men had continued to build on
that <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>uperb foundation of that old Moori<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>h civilization! But in
1923 I found only 30,000 folk, mo<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tly poor and illiterate, living
within the ancient wall<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>; and I <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>miled <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>adly, when, a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> I pa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ed

<p>   It wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> the hi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tory of Spain and it<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> Church in a phra<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>e, Spain
inherited all the <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tupendou<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> wealth and <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>cience of the Arab 
civilization, one city of which could have bought up, ten time<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
over, all the citie<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> of Chri<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tian Europe, and to thi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> it had added
all the wealth it had acquired by the di<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>covery of America. It wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
literally choking with wealth by the middle of the <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ixteenth
century. And little more than a hundred year<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> later it wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> the
poore<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t, mo<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t de<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>pi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ed country in the world. About 5,000,000 folk,
mo<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t of them ragged and unkempt, eked out a poor living on <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>oil
that had given rich <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>u<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tenance to 30,000,000 Arab<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> and their
contented <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ubject<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>. For thi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> awful downfall, one of the <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>adde<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t in
hi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tory, and for all the later di<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ter<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> that fell upon one of the
mo<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t attractive people<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> in Europe, the Black International i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>upremely re<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>pon<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ible.</p>

<p>   By the beginning of the twentieth century Spain had rai<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ed it<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
proud head once more among<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t the nation<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>. It had a fine literature
and a ri<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ing pro<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>perity. The citie<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> that had <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hrunk within the
<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hell of ancient wall<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> were bur<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ting through the<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>e in the
exuberance of the life. The people <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>miled again, like the ro<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>e<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> of
Seville in <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>pring. They had for 80 year<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> fought the <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>trangle-hold
of the Church and had loo<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ened if not broken it. A di<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tingui<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hed
literary traveller, <ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Thirlmere</ent>, went intimately among<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t the people
and wrote thi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> verdict: "The Church know<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> that <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>he i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> doomed in
Spain" (Letter<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> from Catalonia, 1905, p. 437). Mr. <ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Thirlmere</ent> ought
to have been more cautiou<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>. He ought to have added: "Unle<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent> <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>he can
return to her old policy of violence and torture." She ha<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
recovered it. Today Spain i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> back in the ragged Middle Age<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, it<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
people begging food of other nation<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> -- in a land which, with the
crude plow<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> and other implement<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> of a thou<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>and year<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> ago, had
richly nouri<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hed 30,000,000 folk and borne princely citie<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> -- their
mind<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> darkened, their heart<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> broken. And it i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> the work of the
Black International: of the bi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hop<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, prie<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, monk<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, and nun<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, who
have returned to their old <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>leekne<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent> while the people have returned
to their poverty</p>

<p>   In an earlier work I referred to certain evidence of
government by violence, indeed brutal violence, in Spain today. It
may not have appeared in the American pre<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, owing to the Catholic
cen<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>or<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hip, and it i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> material to compare it with the <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>uave
profe<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ion<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> of Catholic apologi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> and the beautiful word<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> they
quote from Papal encyclical<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>. It i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> a <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>imple account of the
experience<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> of a French girl, apparently a Catholic, of nineteen
who e<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>caped from the purgatory of Vichy France into what <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>he call<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
the "hell" of <ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'><ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Franco</ent> Span</ent>. It wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> publi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hed (a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> it make<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> no

<p>   We know what Catholic literature i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, but we have al<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>o here a

Communi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t revolt of 1934. Fortunately, Spain had not yet pa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ed
completely under the control of the Black International, and,

<p>   The mother-<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>uperiore<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent> of a convent wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> pre<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ed to te<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tify

the delicate ear<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> of the nun<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> the in<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>urgent miner<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> who had
taken over the convent a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> a ho<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>pital were not very refined in their

the oppo<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ition to the Republican government came overwhelmingly

believed that the far greater part of the Spani<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>h army wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> loyal,
and thi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> proved to be the ca<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>e in Madrid and many other place<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>.

<p>   The early cour<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>e of the war fairly ju<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tifie<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> that expectation.
and one cannot <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ay that they ought to have fore<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>een that Italy and
Germany would play the part of the Fir<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t and Second Murderer<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>.
Careful attention to <ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Franco</ent>'<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> pilgrimage<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> to Berlin and Rome in
1936 might have warned them but we mu<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t admit that no one would
have expected France and Britain to look on placidly, and even give
mo<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t vital a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tance, while German and Italian troop<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> butchered

coldly gave their airmen practice for the coming war on France and
Britain. </p>

<p>   In the ca<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>e of France Vatican influence counted very
materially. We <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hall <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ee in a later book how clo<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>e at thi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> time wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>

the Protection of Non-Intervention in Spain ought frankly to have
been called the Committee for the Protection of Intervention. The
very moderate <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>upply of arm<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> by di<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tant Ru<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ia -- and even thi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>

<p>   There i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> no need to wait for the tranquil po<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t-war day<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> to

<p>   But there i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> plenty of evidence: not evidence of a <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ecret

<p>   But the Papacy or it<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> Secretary of State very <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>oon made a
declaration which identified it with the holy war from the
beginning. Bi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hop<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, prie<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, and nun, who had under<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tood that

<p>   The Church linked Portugal with Spain in the Civil War. Here
again the record of the Black International i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> vile. To the middle
of the la<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t century, Portugal had the <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ame fate a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> Spain. A king of
di<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>reputable character <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>urrounded by fawning bi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hop<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>lew or

But reform, or moderation <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>et in earlier in that compact little
country than in Spain. When another di<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>reputable monarch began to
play trick<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> in the early year<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> of thi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> century the middle-cla<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
Liberal<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> drove him out, <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>et up a Republic and <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tripped the Church
of all it<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> privilege<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>. Then came the tragic dilemma -- feudali<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>m or
Sociali<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>m, finance or freedom -- and before the <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>pecter of the down
the Red<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, men took down their anti-clerical banner<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>. Portugal
became a military dictator<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hip with the Church in full power once
more.</p>

<p>   Under Pre<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ident General <ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Cremona</ent> and Premier Dr. Salazar,
Portugal i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> what i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> humorou<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ly called a corporative <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tate. The late
<ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Pope</ent>, who knew a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> much about economic<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> and <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ociology a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> a child in
a primary <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>chool doe<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, gave the Catholic world one of tho<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>e
Encyclical<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> which it admire<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>o much, <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>aying that Italy'<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
corporative <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tate i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> the ideal for reconciling capital and labor
and honoring the Church. Naturally, you would not expect a
churchman to notice that thi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> corporative <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tate wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> a gha<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tly
failure, even economically, in hi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> own country, Italy; that crime
wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> ri<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ing by leap<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> and bound<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, and the <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>chool<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> were rotting. In
Portugal, where more than half the people are <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>till piou<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>,
illiterate, and den<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ely ignorant, it wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> comparatively ea<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>y; and
the Je<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>uit<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, who had been expelled, were brought back to help. So
the corporative <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tate wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> e<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tabli<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hed. What did it matter to the
Papacy that, concentrating power over capital and labor in one pair
of hand<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>, it wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> the ideal form of <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tate for an aggre<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ive

<p>   We may take it that <ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Pacelli</ent> wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> the chief author of the
Encyclical 'Quadrage<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>imo Anno' (1931) in which the <ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Pope</ent> <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ummoned
all Catholic countrie<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> to adopt the form of the corporative <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tate.
They were then a ragged regiment; Italy, Poland, Eire, and (more or

not very emphatic on any point except the Papal attitude to the
conque<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t of Aby<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>inia, and he i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> far from <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ati<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>factory on the
point. He <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ay<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> that Catholic<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> "<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ighed in vain" for a Papal
condemnation of <ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Mu<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>olini</ent>'<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> crime, but "the poor old man" wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
content with a refu<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>al to ble<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent> the war, a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> <ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Mu<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>olini</ent> pre<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ed him
to do, or to re<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>train the Italian Church from ble<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ing it.</p>

<p>   It i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>omething to have a Catholic writer admitting that all
the world condemned <ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Mu<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>olini</ent> except the <ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Pope</ent>" (p. 130). The
Catholic pre<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent> generally tried to twi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t vague Papal word<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> into a
condemnation. But it i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> mi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>leading to talk about the "poor old
man." <ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Pacelli</ent> wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> the director of the Papal policy, and there wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
nothing vague or eva<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ive about it. For age<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> the Vatican ha<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> ca<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t a
covetou<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> eye on the Ethiopian Church. The exi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tence of a branch of
Chri<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tianity which had a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> much right to call it<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>elf Catholic a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
that of Rome and wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> equally Apo<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tolic in it<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> foundation, ha<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
alway<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> been a challenge and a reproach to the Vatican, but it wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
little u<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>e dreaming of getting the <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ubmi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ion of the Greek Church.
At the Ru<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ian Revolution, we <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hall <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ee, there wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ome hope of
inducing the athei<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tic new rule<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> to <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>acrifice to the Vatican the
rich and populou<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> branch of the Greek Church in that country, and
for Year<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> the Papacy courted the <ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Hammer</ent> and Sickle a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> eagerly a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> it
later courted the Swa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tika. The hope died, but the Vatican kept it<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
eye on <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>uch independent branche<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> of the Church a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> that of Ethiopia.</p>

<p>   Thi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> the bait which <ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Mu<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>olini</ent> dangled before the <ent type = 'per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>on'>Pope</ent> in

not one word of public condemnation of it. He could be very
eloquent on event<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> far away in Spain, of which he could have no
exact knowledge and on event<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>till farther away and more difficult
to check in Mexico, Ru<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ia, and China. They hurt the Church. But on

nothing to <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ay a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> a world-oracle. It would hurt the Church if he
<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>aid it.</p>

<p>   Once or twice he tried the tactic<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> of that other famou<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>

he glanced at the war-talk and <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>aid that he "hoped for peace,
truth, ju<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tice, and charity." On Augu<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t 28th he had to addre<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent> a

<p>   It i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> impo<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ible to write the<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>e chapter<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> on the action of the
Black International in Spain and Italy without irony and

attitude of the American Catholic layman. A<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> far a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> Spain i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>

true, that intriguing paradox which I have di<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>cu<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ed; how the Red
tail -- and <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>uch a <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>mall one -- had <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ucceeded in wagging the
Catholic dog for <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>even whole year<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>. But when there i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> a que<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tion of
<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>miting Bol<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hevi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>m, you do not notice the<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>e trifle<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>.</p>

<p>   In the ca<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>e of Aby<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>inia the <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ituation wa<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> very different. The

di<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ati<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>faction in the body of the Catholic laity, but the tone of
the Catholic pre<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent> and the utterance<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> of the hierarchy <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>how that it
did not reach very far. Yet you find it impo<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ible to believe that
the Catholic men and women whom you meet in bu<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ine<ent type = 'person'>s</ent><ent type = 'person'>s</ent> or at the club
or a friend'<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> hou<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>e, are <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>o docile to their prie<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> that they will
read without a <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hudder the <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>hocking language of the Italian
prelate<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> I have quoted, or be ea<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ily per<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>uaded that turning
Oriental Catholic<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> into Roman Catholic<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> throw<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> a mantle of ju<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>tice,

<p>   I cannot here go deeply into thi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> matter, but I may make one
point. The relation of a Catholic to hi<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> prie<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>t i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> not the <ent type = 'person'>s</ent>ame a<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>

<p>but believe me, that i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent> the ordinary Catholic mentality. And it i<ent type = 'person'>s</ent>
